9,DE,DEERE & CO,2023-12-15,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS.The following risks are considered material to our business based upon current knowledge, information, and assumptions. This discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with the MD&A, including the risks and uncertainties described in the Forward-Looking Statements, and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These risk factors and other forward-looking statements relate to future events, expectations, trends, and operating periods. They involve certain factors that are subject to change and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business, while others could affect all our businesses. Although the risks are organized by headings and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. The risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Forward-Looking Statements in this report are not the only risks faced by us. STRATEGIC RISKSWe may face risks associated with international, national, and regional trade laws, regulations, and policies, and government farm programs and policies which could significantly impair our profitability and growth prospects.International, national, and regional laws, regulations, and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting the import and export of our products, services, and technology, or those of our customers, or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors, could harm our global business. We are subject to various regulatory risks including, but not limited to, the following: ●Restricted access to global markets could impair our ability to export goods and services from various manufacturing locations around the world. Restricted access could limit the ability to access raw materials and high-quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis. For example, expanding export controls or limits on foreign investment can impact global supply of key materials and components, and actions taken within the US-China trade conflict can impact business in China, as well as sales, import/exports, and/or business engagement with Chinese entities globally.●Trade restrictions, negotiation of new trade agreements, non-tariff trade barriers, local content requirements, and imposition of new or retaliatory tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products, including developments in U.S.-China trade relations, export control and sanctions against Russia, have limited, and could continue to limit, our ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets. These trade restrictions, and changes in, or uncertainty surrounding global trade policies, may affect our competitive position. ●Trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living, which could negatively impact our future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food, fuel, and infrastructure. ●Policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices, or those limiting the export or import of commodities, could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world. Our agricultural equipment sales could be harmed by such policies because farm income influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world. ●Changes in government farm programs and policies can influence demand for agricultural equipment as well as create unequal competition for multinational companies relative to domestic companies. We may be unable to manage increasing political, economic, and social uncertainty in certain regions of the world, which could significantly change the dynamics of our competition, customer base, and product offerings globally.Efforts to grow our businesses depend in part upon access and developing market share and profitability in additional geographic markets, including, but not limited to, Argentina, Brazil, China, India, and South Africa. There are various risks associated with our global footprint, including, but not limited to, the following:●In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions, and differing customer product preferences and requirements than our other markets. In fiscal year 2023, as a result of the war in Ukraine, we suspended shipments of machines and service parts to Russia. The suspension of shipments to Russia reduced actual and forecasted revenue for the region and resulted in impairments of most long-lived assets, among other impacts. In addition, we initiated a voluntary separation program for employees in Russia in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022.●Having business operations in various regions and countries exposes us to multiple and potentially conflicting business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change. These practices and legal requirements are often complex and difficult to navigate, including those related to tariffs and trade regulations, investments, property ownership rights, taxation, repatriation of earnings, and advanced technologies. 14Table of Contents●Expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations, which can materially affect our financial results. ●While we maintain a positive corporate image and our brands are widely recognized and valued in our traditional markets, the brands are less known in some emerging markets, which could impede our efforts to successfully compete in these markets.●Changing U.S. export controls and sanctions on various foreign countries and on various parties could affect our ability to collect receivables, provide aftermarket warranty support for our equipment, sell products, and otherwise impact our reputation and business. We may be impacted by general negative economic conditions and outlook, causing weakened demand for our equipment and services, limiting access to funding, and resulting in higher funding costs.The demand for our products and services depends on the fundamentals in the markets in which we operate and can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment, high interest rates, cautious consumer spending, inflation, lower corporate earnings, and lower business investment. Negative or uncertain economic conditions that cause our customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their likelihood of purchasing our equipment. These economic events adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our operations. Sustained general negative economic conditions and outlook also affect housing starts, energy prices and demand, and other construction, which dampens demand for certain construction equipment. Our turf operations and our construction and forestry segments are dependent on construction activity and have also been affected by recent adverse economic conditions. Decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. If negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy, there could be a similar effect on our agricultural equipment sales. Uncertain or negative outlook with respect to pervasive U.S. fiscal issues as well as general economic conditions and outlook, such as market volatility and continuing interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve, have caused and could continue to cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions. Such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs, which could reduce our earnings and cash flows. We may be affected by changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of renewable energy, which could impact the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for our equipment. This could result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements.Changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the world’s growing food and renewable energy demands, driven in part by government policies, including those related to climate change, and a growing world population, are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices, which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment. Lower agricultural commodity prices directly affect farm incomes, which could negatively affect sales of agricultural equipment and result in higher credit losses. While higher commodity prices benefit our crop-producing agricultural equipment customers, they could result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers, which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers. In addition, changing energy renewable demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise, with corresponding changes in equipment demands. Finally, changes in governmental policies regulating bio-fuel utilization could affect commodity demand and commodity prices, demand for our diesel-fueled equipment, and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of our Smart Industrial Operating Model and Leap Ambitions.Failure to realize the anticipated benefits of our Smart Industrial Operating Model and related business strategies in production systems, precision technologies, and aftermarket support could adversely affect results of our operations and financial condition. Several factors could impact our ability to successfully execute our Smart Industrial Operating Model, including, among other things: ●Failure to accurately assess market opportunities and the technology required to address such opportunities; ●Failure to develop and introduce new technologies or lack of adoption of such technologies by our customers; ●Failure to holistically provide lifecycle solutions; and ●Failure to optimize our capital allocation in connection with the Smart Industrial Operating Model. 15Table of ContentsSimilarly, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our Leap Ambitions and related goals within the expected timelines, or at all. As part of our Leap Ambitions we adopted various goals we expect to achieve by 2026 or 2030. We may not be able to achieve these goals for a variety reasons, some of which may be beyond our control. Examples include:●Our estimates and assumptions related to efficiency of our products and the adoption of precision technology may not be accurate; ●Certain materials, such as quality battery cells and cameras, may become unavailable or too costly; ●The infrastructure required to achieve our goals, such as sufficient charging stations or fuel availability, may become too costly or may not be developed on the expected timeline; and ●The actual or perceived failure to achieve our Leap Ambitions could negatively impact our ability to execute the Smart Industrial Operating Model. We may not realize all anticipated benefits of acquisitions, joint ventures, and divestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected. From time to time, we make strategic acquisitions and divestitures and participate in joint ventures. Acquisitions and joint ventures we have entered, or may enter in the future, may involve significant challenges and risks, including that the acquisitions or joint ventures do not advance our business strategy, or fail to produce satisfactory returns on investment. Other risks include:●We may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations, applying internal control processes to these acquisitions, managing strategic investments, assimilating new capabilities to meet the future needs of our businesses, and/or combining business cultures;●We may choose not to fully integrate businesses and may face regulatory or compliance exposure until appropriate processes and controls are put in place;●Integrating acquisitions is often costly and may require significant attention from management and personnel; ●We may not realize all the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures, or the realized benefits may be significantly delayed; and●Due diligence evaluations of potential transactions include business, legal, and financial reviews with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved. These due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential risks of a particular acquisition or joint venture, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s or joint venture partner’s previous activities or costs associated with any quality issues with an acquisition target’s or joint venture’s products or services. We may also decide to divest businesses if in the best interests of our shareholders and joint ventures may be terminated at or before their stated expiration. For example, in March and October 2023, we sold our financial services and roadbuilding businesses in Russia following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. Divestitures of businesses or dissolutions of joint ventures may involve significant challenges and risks, including failure to advance our business strategy, costs or disruptions to us, and negative effects on our product offerings, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Divestitures of businesses and dissolutions of joint ventures may result in ongoing financial or legal involvement in the divested business through indemnifications or other financial arrangements, such as retained liabilities, which could affect our future financial results. Our ability to understand our customers’ preferences and requirements and to develop, manufacture, and market products that meet customer demand could significantly affect our business results.Our ability to match new product offerings to global customers’ preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality, at affordable prices, is critical to our success. This requires a thorough understanding of our existing and potential customers on a global basis, particularly in growth markets such as Argentina, Brazil, and India. Failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices could have an adverse effect on our business.In addition, customer preferences in the markets we serve are changing as a result of ongoing social and regulatory focus on sustainability as these markets transition to less carbon-intensive business models. As regulations and social pressure drive change, we must continue to proactively monitor trends and develop alternatives and enhancements that elevate and complement our product offerings. For example, even though we plan to offer electric, hybrid-electric, and battery electric equipment solutions, we may be unable to keep up with the rising demand for electric agriculture, turf, and construction equipment.16Table of ContentsThe development of alternative farming techniques, carbon sequestration technologies, and new low-carbon biofuels are changing farmers’ business models and equipment needs. If we fail to continue to develop or invest in emerging technologies to meet changing customer demands, we will be at risk of losing potential sources of revenue, which could affect our future financial results. If we are unable to deliver precision technology and agricultural solutions to our customers, it could affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our approach to precision technology involves hardware and software, guidance, connectivity and digital solutions, automation and machine intelligence, and autonomy. Customers continue to adopt technology integrated in our portfolio of “smart” machines, systems, and solutions. We expect this trend to persist for the foreseeable future. To create and maintain a competitive differentiation, we need to successfully develop and introduce new precision technology solutions that improve profitability and sustainability for our customers. We may make significant investments in research and development, connectivity solutions, digital security for precision technology solutions, and dealer and employee training. These investments may not produce solutions that provide the desired results for customers’ profitability or sustainability outcomes. We utilize automation and machine learning and intelligence in some of our products. While the use of these emerging technologies can present significant benefits, it also creates risks and challenges. Data sourcing, technology, integration and process issues, program bias into decision-making algorithms, security problems, and the protection of privacy could impair the adoption and acceptance of autonomous machine solutions. If the output from these solutions is deemed to be inaccurate or questionable, our brand and reputation may be harmed and we may be subject to legal liability claims. Automation and machine learning and intelligence may also become the subject of local, state, federal, and foreign regulatory efforts limiting the features and capabilities of the technology. If we are not able to deliver precision technology solutions with differentiated features and functionality, or these solutions are not effective, customers may not adopt technology solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.We could be impacted by changes to or reallocation of radio frequency (RF) bands which could disrupt or degrade the reliability of our high precision augmented Global Positioning System (GPS) or other RF technology, which could impair our ability to develop and market GPS- and RF-based technology solutions, as well as significantly reduce agricultural and construction customers’ profitability.Our current and planned integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems, as well as our fleet management telematics solutions for construction equipment, depend upon the use of RF signals. These signals include, but are not limited to, GPS signals, other GPS-like satellite signals, augmented GPS services, and other RF technologies that link equipment, operations, owners, dealers, and technicians. These radio services depend on frequency allocations governed by international and national government agencies. Any international or national reallocation of frequency bands, including frequency bands segmentation and band spectrum sharing, or other modifications concerning the regulation of frequency bands, could significantly disrupt or degrade the utility and reliability of our GPS-based products, which could negatively affect our ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions. In addition, disruptions with GPS signals or the failure of telecommunications network operators to supply the bandwidth we need to support our products could interfere with the speed, availability, and usability of our equipment and services. If these GPS signals or RF signals become unavailable, our customers could be unable to use their equipment indefinitely. For our agricultural customers, this could result in lower crop yields, decreased operational efficiency, and higher equipment maintenance, seed, fertilizer, fuel, and wage costs. For construction customers, this could result in higher fuel and equipment maintenance costs, as well as lower construction design and project management efficiencies. These cost increases could significantly reduce customers’ profitability, sustainability, and demand for our products. As a result, our sales and revenue could significantly decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our business.Our ability to adapt in highly competitive markets could affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.We compete in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets with other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. In addition, our industry is attracting non-traditional competitors, including technology-focused companies and start-up ventures. We compete on product performance, innovation and quality, distribution, sustainability, customer service, and price. Aggressive pricing or other strategies of competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing delays, or our failure to price products competitively could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.We rely on a network of independent dealers to manage the distribution of our products and services. If dealers are unsuccessful with their sales and business operations, it could have an adverse effect on our overall sales and revenue. We rely on the capability of our dealers to develop and implement effective sales plans to create demand among purchasers for the equipment and related products and services that dealers purchase from us. If our dealers are unsuccessful in these endeavors, we will be unable to grow our sales and revenue, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition. 17Table of ContentsIn addition, the dealer channel’s ability to support and service precision technology solutions and emerging power solutions may affect customers’ acceptance and adoption rates of these products. The unavailability of specialized technicians to service our equipment may result in overburdening dealers’ servicing capacity. Dealers may have trouble funding their day-to-day cash flow needs and paying their obligations due to adverse business conditions resulting from negative economic effects or other factors. Dealers may exit or we may seek to terminate relationships with certain dealers if they are unable to meet customer needs. The unplanned loss of any of our dealers could lead to inadequate market coverage, negative customer impressions, and may adversely impact our ability to collect receivables that are associated with that dealer. ENVIRONMENTAL, CLIMATE, AND WEATHER RISKSUnfavorable weather conditions or natural catastrophes that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment could directly and indirectly affect our business.The purchasing decisions of our customers, particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment, can be significantly affected by poor or unusual weather conditions. Such conditions include: ●Insufficient levels of rain, which prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields; ●Excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting from occurring at optimal times and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth; ●Temperatures outside normal ranges, which can cause crop failure or decreased yields and may also affect disease incidence; ●Natural disasters such as regional floods, hurricanes or other storms, droughts, diseases, wildfires, and pests, either as a physical effect of climate change or otherwise, which have had, and could in the future have, significant negative effects on agricultural and livestock production;●Adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region, particularly during the important spring selling season; and●Drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and can similarly cause lower sales volume.Each of these conditions could have a negative impact on farm income which can affect demand for agricultural equipment and the financial condition and credit risk of our dealers and customers. Governmental actions designed to address climate change based on the emergence of new technologies and business models in connection with the transition to a lower-carbon economy could adversely affect John Deere and our customers. There is global scientific consensus that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions continue to alter the composition of Earth’s atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate. These considerations have led to new international, national, regional, and local legislative and regulatory responses. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders, and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, including us, are continuing to look for ways to reduce GHG emissions. The regulation of GHG emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources or the imposition of carbon pricing mechanisms could result in additional costs to us in the form of taxes or emission allowances, required facilities improvements, and increased energy costs. These results would increase our operating costs through higher utility, transportation, and materials cost and could prevent us from selling products into certain markets. Increased input costs, such as fuel and fertilizer, and compliance-related costs could also affect customer operations and demand for our equipment. Further, our financial services segment is subject to additional international and national European regulations relating to climate and environmental risk, which are continually evolving and could affect the financing operations and climate-risk processes developed by the segment. Regulators in Europe and the U.S. have also focused efforts on increased disclosure related to climate change and mitigation efforts. The EU recently adopted the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) that will impose disclosure of the risks and opportunities arising from social and environmental issues, and on the impact of companies’ activities on people and the environment. The CSRD will need to be transposed into Member State law before it becomes effective, which is expected to occur in 2024. Similarly, the State of California recently passed the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act that will impose broad climate-related disclosure obligations on certain companies doing business in California, including us, starting in 2026. The SEC has included in its regulatory agenda potential rulemaking on climate change disclosures that, if adopted, could significantly increase compliance burdens and associated regulatory costs and complexity. 18Table of ContentsIncreasingly stringent engine emission regulations or bans on internal combustion engines may impact our ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment, which could negatively affect business results.Our equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction regulations throughout the world, including the European Union’s Stage V standard, which limits the amount of certain substances in exhaust gases that off-road engines can emit into the environment. Governmental agencies throughout the world are enacting more stringent laws and regulations to reduce off-road engine emissions. These laws and regulations are applicable to engines we manufacture, including those used in agriculture and CF equipment. We have incurred, and continue to incur, substantial research and development costs related to the implementation of these more rigorous laws and regulations. While we have developed and are executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements, these plans are subject to variables that could delay or otherwise affect our ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or engines, which could negatively impact business results. Additionally, in certain locations governments have banned, or may in the future ban, internal combustion engines for some types of products completely. To the extent these bans affect products manufactured and sold by us, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be negatively affected.FINANCIAL RISKS Changes in government banking, monetary, and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on us.Policies of the U.S. and other governments regarding banking, monetary, and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity, stabilize financial markets, and/or address local deficit or structural economic issues could have a material impact on our customers and markets. Central bank policy interest rates continued to increase in fiscal year 2023. Most of our retail receivables are fixed rate, while wholesale financing receivables are variable rate. We have both fixed and variable rate borrowings. Historically, rising interest rates impact our borrowings sooner than the benefit is realized from the financing receivable and equipment on operating lease portfolios. Our operations and results could also be affected by financial regulatory reform that could, among other things, have an adverse effect on the financial services segment and on our customers by limiting their ability to enter hedging transactions or to finance purchases of our products. Government policies on spending can also affect us, especially the CF segment, due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development. Our operations, including those outside of the U.S., may also be affected by non-U.S. regulatory reforms being implemented to further regulate non-U.S. financial institutions and markets. Changes in tax rates, tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a negative effect on our business.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount more than amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected. Our consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in foreign currencies, creating currency exchange and translation risk.We are a global company with transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn our revenues. Additionally, the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of our assets, liabilities, expenses, and revenues are denominated in other countries’ currencies, which are then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates and reported in our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates affect the value of those items as reflected in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value remains unchanged in the original currencies. While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego any benefits that may result from favorable fluctuations in such rates. In Argentina, we have employed mechanisms to convert Argentine pesos into U.S. dollars to the extent possible. These mechanisms are short-term in nature, leaving us exposed to long-term currency fluctuations.Changes in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect our financials and our earnings and/or cash flows. Central bank policy interest rates continued to increase in fiscal year 2023. Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of our customers, either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for our equipment and customers’ ability to repay their obligations to us. Rising interest rates may cause credit market 19Table of Contentsdislocations, that can impact funding costs, which can affect the financial services segment’s ability to offer customers competitive financing rates. While we strive to match the interest rate characteristics of our financial assets and liabilities, changing interest rates have had an adverse effect on our net interest rate margin—the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rates we pay for funding, which has affected our net interest income and earnings. In addition, actions by credit rating agencies, such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks, can affect the availability and cost of funding for us and can increase our costs of capital and hurt our competitive position.Because the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of our sales worldwide, negative economic conditions in the financial industry could materially impact our operations and financial results.Negative economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates. The financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of our sales worldwide. The financial services segment is exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractual obligations and may experience credit losses that exceed our expectations and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The financial services segment’s inability to access funds at cost-effective rates to support our financing activities could have a material adverse effect on our business. The financial services segment’s liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital to meet future cash flow requirements and to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities. Additionally, negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels, resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact the financial services segment’s write-offs and provision for credit losses. The financial services segment may also experience residual value losses that exceed our expectations caused by lower pricing for used equipment and higher-than-expected equipment returns at lease maturity.We may sustain increases in funding obligations under our pension plans which may impair our liquidity or financial condition.We maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for certain employees, which impose funding obligations. We use various assumptions in calculating our future payment obligations under these plans. Significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of return on pension investments being lower than expected. Regulatory changes could cause a deterioration in the statutory funded status of our plans. We may be required to make significant contributions to our pension plans in the future. These factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.MANUFACTURING AND OPERATIONAL RISKSWe may be unable to accurately forecast customer demand for products and services, and to adequately manage inventory, which could adversely affect our operating results.To ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and expenses and place orders sufficiently in advance with suppliers and contract manufacturers. These forecasts are based on estimates of future demand for products and services. Failure to accurately forecast our needs may result in unmet market demand, parts shortages, manufacturing delays, increased costs, or excess inventory. In fiscal year 2022, supply chain disruptions resulted in higher inventory levels. Although production schedules in fiscal year 2023 were more aligned with the customers’ seasonal use of our products, marking a return to historical seasonal production patterns, our ability to accurately forecast demand in the future could be affected by many factors, including changes in customer demand for our products and services, changes in demand for the products and services of competitors, unanticipated changes in general market conditions, and the weakening of economic conditions or customer confidence in future economic conditions. If the forecasts used to manage inventory are not accurate, we may experience excess inventory levels, shortage of available products, or reduced manufacturing efficiencies.Changes in the availability and price of certain raw materials, components, and whole goods have resulted and could continue to result in disruptions to the supply chain causing production disruptions, increased costs, and lower profits on sales of our products.We require access to various raw materials, components, and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute our products. The price and availability of these materials have varied significantly in the last 36 months. For example, in fiscal year 2022, supply chain disruptions impacted many aspects of our business, including receiving past due deliveries from suppliers, parts availability, increased production costs, and higher inventory levels. We experienced supply chain improvements in fiscal year 2023 with a return to normal in the second half of the fiscal year. While we have seen stabilization in the supply chain and some commodity pricing improvements, we anticipate potential fluctuations due to inflation, geopolitical and economic uncertainty, and regulatory and policy instability, including import tariffs and trade agreements. The latter have the potential to significantly increase production and logistics costs and have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business, particularly if we are unable to recover the increased costs due to market considerations or other ​20Table of Contentsfactors. We have experienced changes in the availability and prices of these raw materials, components, whole goods, and freight over the past several years, especially in fiscal years 2021 and 2022.Global logistics network challenges resulted in delays, shortages of key manufacturing components, increased order backlogs, increased transportation costs, and production inefficiencies from a higher number of partially completed machines in inventory, which increased our overall production and overhead costs. Increases in such costs have had an adverse effect on our business operations.We rely on our suppliers to acquire the raw materials, components, and whole goods required to manufacture their products. Significant disruptions to the supply chain resulting from shortages of raw materials, components, and whole goods have and could continue to adversely affect our ability to meet commitments to our customers. In addition, certain materials and components used in our products are acquired from a single supplier or are proprietary in nature and cannot be alternatively sourced expeditiously. Furthermore, if our customers are unwilling to accept price increases for our products, or if we are unable to offset the increases in costs, raw material costs or shortages could have a material adverse effect on our operational or financial results. Disputes with labor unions may adversely affect our ability to operate in our facilities as well as impact our financial results. Many of our production and maintenance employees are represented by labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements with different expiration dates. Our failure to successfully renegotiate labor agreements as they expire has from time to time led, and could in the future lead, to work stoppages or other disputes with labor unions. For example, the UAW initiated a labor strike that had an adverse effect on our results of operations in fiscal 2022 because of reduced productions and shipments. Certain of our labor agreements expire as early as 2024. Disruptions to our manufacturing and parts-distribution facilities through various forms of labor disputes could adversely affect us. Any strike, work stoppage, or other dispute with a labor union distracts management from operating the business, may displace employees from ordinary job positions to fill in vacant positions, may affect our reputation, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our business may suffer if our equipment fails to perform as expected.If our equipment does not perform as expected, we may receive warranty claims and have to perform post-sales repairs or recalls. We may also be subject to regulatory requirements and penalties that will impact our ability to develop, market, and sell equipment. This may result in product delivery delays. It could also lead to product liability, breach of warranty, and consumer protection claims. These claims and warranty expenses could be significant. As a manufacturer of equipment, we must manage the cost and risk associated with product warranties, post-sale repairs and recalls, regulatory penalties, and product liability, breach of warranty, and consumer protection claims with respect to our products. In addition to post-sale repairs or recalls initiated by us for various reasons, investigations into our products by government regulators may compel us to initiate product recalls or may result in negative public perceptions about the safety of our products, even if we disagree with the regulator’s determination. Such post-sale repairs or recalls, whether voluntary or involuntary, could result in significant expense, supply chain complications, and may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results.RESOURCES RISKS Our ability to attract, develop, engage, and retain qualified employees could affect our ability to execute our strategy.Our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and attract qualified candidates with the requisite education, background, and experience as well as our ability to develop, engage, and retain qualified employees. Failure to attract, develop, engage, and retain qualified employees, whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants, difficulty in recruiting new employees, or inadequate resources to train, integrate, and retain qualified employees, could impair our ability to execute our business strategy and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, while we strive to reduce the impact of the departure of employees, our operations or ability to execute our business strategy and meet our business objectives may be affected by the loss of employees, particularly when departures involve larger numbers of employees, such as those we could experience if a surge occurs in the number of employees voluntarily leaving their jobs. Higher rates of employee separations may adversely affect us through decreased employee morale, the loss of knowledge of departing employees, and the devotion of resources to recruiting and onboarding new employees. Security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations and could compromise our information as well as information of our employees, customers, suppliers, and/or dealers, exposing us to liability that could cause our business and reputation to suffer.In the ordinary course of business, we rely upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing, and collection of payments from dealers and other purchasers of our equipment and from customers of the financial services segment. We use information technology systems to record, process, and 21Table of Contentssummarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements. Additionally, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and the proprietary business information of our customers, suppliers, and dealers, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in data centers which are often owned by third parties and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy.Despite security measures, including a vulnerability disclosure program, and business continuity plans, our information technology networks and infrastructure have been and may be vulnerable to intrusion, damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals, employees’, suppliers’, or dealers’ error or malfeasance, supply chain compromise, disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, ransomware or other malware, telecommunication or utility failures, terrorist acts, natural disasters, or other events. Although we have not suffered any significant cyber incidents that resulted in material business impact, we have from time to time been the target of malicious cyber threat actors. The occurrence of any significant event could compromise our networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, obtained, publicly disclosed, lost, altered, misused, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, alteration, misuse, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, government investigations, liability or regulatory penalties, disruption or shut down of our operations, and damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Furthermore, as security threats continue to evolve and increase in frequency and sophistication, we may need to invest additional resources to protect information security.Any unauthorized control or manipulation of our products’ systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our products. Some of our products include connectivity hardware and software typically used for remote system updates. While we have implemented security measures intended to protect against unauthorized remote access to these products, malicious threat actors have attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to such products in order to gain control of the products, change the products’ functionality, user interface, or performance characteristics, interfere with the products’ operations, or gain access to data stored in or generated by the products or to systems to which they connect. In addition, reports of unauthorized access to our products, systems, and data, regardless of their reliability, may result in the perception that the products, systems, or data are vulnerable to malicious or unauthorized modifications. Any unauthorized access to or control of our products or systems, any loss of data, or any perception that products, systems, or data are vulnerable could result in legal claims or proceedings against us, government investigations, liability, or regulatory penalties, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our business could be adversely affected by the infringement or loss of intellectual property rights.We protect our intellectual property with a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, and legal agreements. We heavily rely on certain trademarks to protect our identity and customer recognition of our products and services, including, but not limited to, the “John Deere” mark, the leaping deer logo, the “Nothing Runs Like a Deere” slogan, and the green and yellow color combination. These trademarks, as well as the many patents that protect innovations used in our products, are integral to our business, and their loss could have a material adverse effect on us. Additionally, third parties may initiate legal proceedings to challenge the validity of our intellectual property or allege that we infringe on their intellectual property. We may incur substantial costs if third parties initiate such legal proceedings, or if we initiate legal proceedings to protect or enforce our intellectual property. If the outcome of any such legal proceedings is unfavorable to us, our business could be adversely affected. LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS Our global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations, the violation of which could expose us to potential liabilities, increased costs, and other adverse effects.We are subject to numerous international, federal, state, and local laws and regulations, many of which are complex, frequently changing, and subject to varying interpretations. These laws and regulations cover a variety of subjects, including advertising, anti-money laundering, antitrust, consumer finance, environmental, climate-related, health and safety, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, foreign ownership and investment, import/export and trade, human rights, labor and employment, product liability reporting, cybersecurity, data privacy, telematics, and connectivity. These laws may vary substantially within the different markets in which we operate. Compliance with these laws and regulations is expensive and may further increase the cost of conducting our global operations. In addition, we must comply with the U.S. Foreign 22Table of ContentsCorrupt Practices Act and all applicable foreign anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act. These laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage, regardless of whether those practices are culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction. Although we have a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in criminal or civil sanctions and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.Changes to existing laws and regulations, or changes to how they are interpreted, or the implementation of new, more stringent laws or regulations, could adversely affect our business by increasing compliance costs, limiting our ability to offer a product or service, requiring changes to our business practices, or otherwise making our products and services less attractive to customers. Legislative and regulatory changes, and other actions that could potentially affect our business may be announced with little or no advance notice and we may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse effects from such measures.We are subject to governmental laws, regulations, and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection. Any inability or perceived inability of addressing these requirements could adversely affect our business.The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. We collect personal information and other data as integral parts of our business processes and activities. This data is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including oversight by various regulatory and other governmental bodies. Many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the EU, China, Canada, and other relevant jurisdictions where we conduct business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal information and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the China Personal Information Protection Law, among others, impose stringent data protection requirements and provide significant penalties for noncompliance. New privacy laws will continue to come into effect around the world in the future. Any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns (even if unfounded), or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations (including at newly acquired companies) could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and otherwise adversely affect our business.Legal proceedings and disputes in which we are, and may in the future be, involved could harm our business, financial condition, reputation, and brand. We routinely are a party to claims and legal actions incidental to our business. These include claims for personal injury or property by users of our equipment, environmental, health, and safety claims, disputes with distributors, vendors and others with respect to commercial matters, and disputes with taxing and other governmental authorities regarding the conduct of our business. The defense of lawsuits and government inquiries or investigations has resulted and may result in expenditures of significant financial resources and the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations. We are currently subject to a consolidated multidistrict class action lawsuit in the Northern District of Illinois alleging that we have engaged in attempted monopolization, exclusionary conduct, and restraint of the market for repair services for John Deere brand agricultural equipment by limiting repair resources only to our authorized technicians or independent authorized John Deere dealers. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is investigating whether we have violated laws in connection with the repair of John Deere brand agriculture equipment, as well as our information security practices and statements as they relate to the risk of unauthorized access to our computer systems, products, and services. We are fully cooperating with the FTC. We are currently unable to predict the outcome of these matters. The development and resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and financial results.GENERAL RISKSOur reputation and brand could be damaged by negative publicity. Our brand has worldwide recognition and significantly contributes to the success of our business. Our reputation is critical to growing our customer base. Our brand depends on the ability to maintain a positive customer perception of the business, including the core values of integrity, quality, innovation, and commitment. Negative claims or publicity involving us, our products or services, our culture and values, our stance on environmental, social, and governance topics, customer data, or any of our key employees or suppliers, could damage our reputation and brand image, regardless of whether such claims are accurate. In addition, our stance on environmental, social, and governance topics damage to our reputation could adversely impact the ability to attract new and maintain existing customers, employees, dealers, and business relationships. For example, we have been the subject of negative media articles relating to our customers’ right to maintain and safely repair their equipment. 23Table of ContentsAdditionally, negative or inaccurate postings, articles, or comments on social media and the internet about us could generate negative publicity that could damage the reputation of our brand. Further, adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us, or legal proceedings initiated by us, could also damage our reputation and brand image, undermine customer confidence, and reduce long-term demand for equipment, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. If the reputation, culture, or image of our brands are damaged, or we receive negative publicity, then our sales, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Unexpected events have increased and may in the future increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations. The occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including war, acts of terrorism, epidemics and pandemics (such as the COVID pandemic), civil unrest, fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and other forms of severe weather in the United States or in other countries in which we operate, or in which our suppliers are located, have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such events have caused and could cause complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruptions in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers, and disruption and delay in the transport of products to dealers, end-users, and distribution centers. Existing insurance coverage may not provide protection from all the costs that may arise from such events.The potential physical impacts of climate change on our facilities, suppliers, and customers, and therefore on our operations, are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographic regions. These potential physical effects may adversely affect the demand for our products and the cost, production, sales, and financial performance of our operations. ​"
12,DE,DEERE & CO,2022-12-15,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS.The following risks are considered material to John Deere’s business based upon current knowledge, information, and assumptions. This discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including the risks and uncertainties described in the Forward-Looking Statements, and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These risk factors and other forward-looking statements relate to future events, expectations, trends, and operating periods, and involve certain factors that are subject to change and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business, while others could affect all the Company’s businesses. Although the risks are organized by headings and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. The risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the “Forward-Looking Statements” in this report are not the only risks faced by the Company. ​STRATEGIC RISKSInternational, national, and regional trade laws, regulations, and policies (particularly those related to or restricting global trade) and government farm programs and policies could significantly impair John Deere’s profitability and growth prospects.International, national, and regional laws, regulations, and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting the import and export of John Deere’s products, services, and technology, or those of our customers, including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions, or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors, could harm John Deere’s global business. John Deere’s profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace. Restricted access to global markets impairs John Deere’s ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world and limits the ability to access raw materials and high-quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis. Trade restrictions, including withdrawal from or modification of existing trade agreements, negotiation of new trade agreements, non-tariff trade barriers, local content requirements, and imposition of new or retaliatory tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products, including developments in U.S.-China trade relations and sanctions against Russia, have limited, and could continue to limit, John Deere’s ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair John Deere’s ability to expand the business. These trade restrictions, and changes in, or uncertainty surrounding, global trade policies, may affect John Deere’s competitive position. Policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world. John Deere’s agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed by such policies because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world. Furthermore, trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living, which could negatively impact John Deere’s future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food, fuel, and infrastructure. Additionally, changes in government farm programs and policies, including direct payment and other subsidies, can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment as well as create unequal competition for multinational companies relative to domestic companies. Greater political, economic, and social uncertainty and the evolving globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of John Deere’s competition, customer base, and product offerings and impact John Deere’s growth opportunities globally.John Deere’s efforts to grow its businesses depend in part upon access to additional geographic markets, including, but not limited to, Argentina, Brazil, China, India, and South Africa, and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in such markets. In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions, and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than John Deere’s other markets. Having business operations in various regions and countries exposes John Deere to multiple and potentially conflicting business practices, and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change and are often complex and difficult to navigate, including those related to tariffs and trade regulations, investments, property ownership rights, taxation, repatriation of earnings, and advanced technologies. Expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations, which can materially affect the Company’s financial results. While John Deere maintains a positive corporate image and its brands are widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets, the brands are less known in some emerging markets, which could impede John Deere’s efforts to successfully compete in these markets. In addition, changing U.S. export controls and sanctions on China, as well as other restrictions affecting transactions involving China and Chinese parties, could affect John Deere’s ability to collect receivables, provide aftermarket warranty support for John Deere equipment, sell products, and otherwise impact John Deere’s reputation and business. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine could adversely impact our business and financial results. On February 24, 2022, John Deere suspended shipments of machines and service parts to Russia and Belarus. After assessing the impact of the Russia and Ukraine conflict on our operations within Russia, our senior management in the U.S. decided to initiate a 14Table of Contentsvoluntary employee-separation program, which reduced overall headcount in Russia. We may further reduce or discontinue operations in Russia depending on the continued evolution of the conflict, monetary, currency or payment controls, restrictions on access to financial institutions, supply and transportation challenges, sanctions and export controls and counter-sanctions, or other circumstances and considerations. Our U.S. senior management continues to closely monitor all risks to John Deere operations in the region. The broader consequences of the Russia and Ukraine conflict such as, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shift, access to natural gas, higher energy prices, potential retaliatory action by the Russian government, including nationalization of foreign businesses, increased tensions between the U.S. and countries in which we operate, and the extent of the conflict’s effect on the global economy, cannot be predicted, including the extent to which the conflict may heighten other risks disclosed herein. Ultimately, these or other factors could result in further loss or write-downs of other operating assets and working capital.Negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for John Deere’s equipment and services, limit access to funding, and result in higher funding costs.The demand for John Deere’s products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment, rising interest rates, cautious consumer spending, changes in consumer practices due to a possible recession, lower corporate earnings, and lower business investment. Negative or uncertain economic conditions that cause John Deere’s customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their likelihood of purchasing John Deere’s equipment. The COVID pandemic, geopolitical instability, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and other global events have significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. Some of the results of these events include supply chain challenges, inflation, high interest rates, foreign currency exchange volatility, and volatility in global capital markets. Supply chain challenges, including delays caused by shortages of raw materials, shipping containers and labor, have increased production costs and reduced our profit margins. Additionally, the cost of raw materials used in John Deere’s products and the cost of freight have increased due to heightened inflation. These adverse economic events have and may continue to adversely affect John Deere’s operations. Sustained negative economic conditions and outlook also affect housing starts, energy prices and demand, and other construction, which dampens demand for certain construction equipment. John Deere’s turf operations and its construction and forestry segments are dependent on construction activity and have also been affected by recent adverse economic conditions. In fiscal 2022, supply constraints, shortage of turf inventory, and softening customer demand have affected our production and sales of consumer products within these segments. Decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on John Deere’s results of operations. If negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy, there could be a similar effect on John Deere’s agricultural equipment sales. In addition, uncertain or negative outlook with respect to pervasive U.S. fiscal issues as well as general economic conditions and outlook, such as market volatility and continued interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve, have caused and could continue to cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions. Such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs, which could reduce the Company’s earnings and cash flows. Additionally, the Company’s investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets, including the recent volatility of the United Kingdom’s bond market, which would negatively affect earnings.Changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of bio-energy could affect the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain John Deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements.Changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the world’s growing food and bio-energy demands, driven in part by government policies, including those related to climate change, and a growing world population, are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices, which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment. Lower agricultural commodity prices directly affect farm incomes, which could negatively affect sales of agricultural equipment and result in higher credit losses. While higher commodity prices benefit John Deere’s crop-producing agricultural equipment customers, higher commodity prices also could result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers, which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers. Furthermore, changing bio-energy demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise, with corresponding changes in equipment demands. Finally, changes in governmental policies regulating bio-fuel utilization could affect commodity demand and commodity prices, demand for John Deere’s diesel-fueled equipment, and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards.John Deere may not realize the anticipated benefits of its Smart Industrial operating model and Leap Ambitions. John Deere’s failure to realize the anticipated benefits of its Smart Industrial operating model and related business strategies in production systems, precision technologies, and aftermarket support could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. Several factors could impact John Deere’s ability to successfully execute the Smart Industrial operating model, including, among other things, failure to accurately assess market opportunity and the technology required to address such 15Table of Contentsopportunity; failure to develop and introduce new technologies or lack of adoption of such technologies by John Deere’s customers; and failure to holistically execute lifecycle solutions. In addition, if the Company is unable to optimize its capital allocation in connection with the operating model, it may not be able to realize the full benefits, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Similarly, John Deere may not realize the anticipated benefits of its Leap Ambitions and related goals in the expected timeline, or at all. As part of its Leap Ambitions framework, John Deere adopted various goals that it expects to achieve by 2026 or 2030, as applicable. John Deere may not be able to achieve these goals for a number of reasons, some of which may be out of its control. For example, John Deere’s estimates and assumptions related to efficiency of our products and the adoption of precision technology may not be accurate; certain materials, such as quality battery cells, may become unavailable or too costly; or infrastructure required to achieve our goals, such as sufficient charging stations, may become too costly or may not occur on the expected timeline. The actual or perceived failure to achieve our Leap Ambitions could negatively impact our ability to execute the Smart Industrial operating model, and could harm our reputation and our business. John Deere may not realize all anticipated benefits of acquisitions, joint ventures, and divestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected. From time to time, John Deere makes strategic acquisitions and divestitures and participates in joint ventures. In an effort to enhance its Smart Industrial operating model by adding technology and talent, during fiscal year 2022, the Company acquired majority ownership in Kreisel Electric Inc., which designs and manufactures high-durability battery packs and high-powered charging stations; a 40 percent equity method investment in GUSS Automation LLC, a producer of semi-autonomous orchard and vineyard sprayers; and LGT, LLC (Light), which specializes in depth sensing and camera-based perception for autonomous vehicles. Acquisitions and joint ventures that John Deere has entered, or may enter in the future, may involve significant challenges and risks, including that the acquisitions or joint ventures do not advance John Deere’s business strategy or fail to produce satisfactory returns on investment. John Deere may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with its operations, applying internal control processes to these acquisitions, managing strategic investments, and assimilating new capabilities to meet the future needs of John Deere’s businesses. Integrating acquisitions is often costly and may require significant attention from management. Furthermore, John Deere may not realize all the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures, or the realized benefits may be significantly delayed. While our evaluation of any potential transaction includes business, legal, and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved, these due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential risks of a particular acquisition or joint venture, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s or joint venture partner’s previous activities or costs associated with any quality issues with an acquisition target's or joint venture’s products or services. John Deere may decide to divest businesses if it determines any such divestiture is in the best interests of its shareholders, and joint ventures may be terminated at or before their stated expiration, such as the joint venture between the Company and Hitachi, which the Company agreed to voluntarily terminate in fiscal 2021. Divestitures of businesses or dissolutions of joint ventures may involve significant challenges and risks, including failure to advance our business strategy, costs or disruptions to John Deere, and negative effects on John Deere’s product offerings, which may adversely affect John Deere’s business, results of operations, and financial condition. Divestitures of businesses or dissolutions of joint ventures may result in ongoing financial or legal involvement in the divested business through indemnifications or other financial arrangements, such as retained liabilities, which could affect the Company’s future financial results. John Deere’s ability to understand its customers’ specific preferences and requirements, and to develop, manufacture, and market products that meet customer demand, could significantly affect its business results.John Deere’s ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers’ anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality, at affordable prices, is critical to its success. This requires a thorough understanding of John Deere’s existing and potential customers on a global basis, particularly in growth markets such as Argentina, Brazil, and India. Failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on John Deere’s business.Customer preferences in the markets served by John Deere could change as these markets transition to less carbon-intensive business models. Ongoing social and regulatory focus on sustainability and the impact of policies and consumer preferences on the construction, forestry, and agriculture industries mean that change is imminent. As regulations and social pressure drive change, John Deere must be proactive in monitoring trends and developing alternatives and enhancements that complement our product offerings. For example, the Company may be unable to keep up with the rising demand for electric agriculture, turf, and construction equipment.16Table of ContentsThe development of alternative farming techniques, carbon sequestration technologies, and new low-carbon biofuels, could change farmers’ business models and equipment needs. If John Deere fails to properly develop or invest in new technologies to meet changing customer demands, John Deere will be at risk of losing potential sources of revenue, which could affect the Company’s future financial results. The inability to accurately forecast customer demand for products and services, and to adequately manage inventory, could adversely affect our operating results.To ensure adequate inventory supply, John Deere must forecast inventory needs and expenses and place orders sufficiently in advance with suppliers and contract manufacturers. These forecasts are based on estimates of future demand for particular products and services. Failure to accurately forecast our needs may result in unmet market demand, parts shortages, manufacturing delays, increased costs, or excess inventory. In response to recent supply chain constraints, John Deere has worked with suppliers to ensure optimum inventory levels. John Deere’s ability to accurately forecast demand could be affected by many factors, including changes in customer demand for John Deere’s products and services, changes in demand for the products and services of competitors, unanticipated changes in general market conditions, and the weakening of economic conditions or customer confidence in future economic conditions. If the forecasts used to manage inventory are not accurate, John Deere has in the past and may in the future experience excess inventory levels, shortage of available products, or reduced manufacturing efficiencies. If John Deere is unable to deliver precision technology and agricultural solutions to its customers, it could affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition. John Deere’s approach to precision technology involves hardware and software, guidance, connectivity and digital solutions, automation and machine intelligence, and autonomy. To create and maintain a competitive differentiation through precision technology solutions, John Deere needs to successfully develop and introduce new precision technology solutions that improve profitability and sustainability for customers through the production systems. John Deere may make significant investments in research and development, connectivity solutions, data security for precision technology solutions, and employee training. These investments may not produce solutions that provide the desired results for customers’ profitability or sustainability outcomes. If John Deere is not able to deliver precision technology solutions with differentiated features and functionality, customers may not adopt technology solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s reputation and business.Changes to or reallocation of radio frequency (RF) bands could disrupt or degrade the reliability of John Deere’s high precision augmented Global Positioning System (GPS) or other RF technology, which could impair John Deere’s ability to develop and market GPS- and RF-based technology solutions as well as significantly reduce agricultural and construction customers’ profitability.John Deere’s current and planned integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems, as well as its fleet management telematics solutions for construction equipment, depend upon the use of RF signals. These signals include, but are not limited to, GPS signals, other GPS-like satellite signals, augmented GPS services, and other RF technologies that link equipment, operations, owners, dealers, and technicians. These radio services depend on frequency allocations governed by international and national government agencies. Any international or national reallocation of frequency bands, including frequency bands segmentation and band spectrum sharing, or other modifications concerning the regulation of frequency bands, could significantly disrupt or degrade the utility and reliability of John Deere’s GPS-based products, which could negatively affect John Deere’s ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions. For John Deere’s agricultural customers, the inability to use high-precision augmented GPS signals or other RF signals could result in lower crop yields and higher equipment maintenance, seed, fertilizer, fuel, and wage costs. For construction customers, disrupting GPS or RF applications could result in higher fuel and equipment maintenance costs, as well as lower construction design and project management efficiencies. These cost increases could significantly reduce customers’ profitability and demand for John Deere products.John Deere’s ability to adapt in highly competitive markets could affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition.John Deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets. John Deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. In addition, John Deere’s industry is attracting non-traditional competitors, including technology-focused companies and start-up ventures. John Deere competes on the basis of product performance, innovation and quality, distribution, customer service, and price. Aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing delays, or John Deere’s failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition. John Deere relies on a network of independent dealers to manage the distribution of its products. If dealers are unsuccessful with their sales and business operations, it could have an adverse effect on overall sales and revenue. John Deere relies on the capability of its dealers to develop and implement effective sales plans to create demand among purchasers for the equipment and related products and services that the dealers purchase from John Deere. If John Deere’s dealers are not 17Table of Contentssuccessful in these endeavors, then John Deere will be unable to grow its sales and revenue, which would have an adverse effect on its financial condition. In addition, the dealer channel’s ability to support and service precision technology solutions and emerging power solutions may affect customers’ acceptance and adoption rates of these products. Dealers may have trouble funding their day-to-day cash flow needs and paying their obligations due to adverse business conditions resulting from negative economic effects or other factors. Dealers may exit or John Deere may seek to terminate relationships with certain dealers if they are unable to meet customer needs. The unplanned loss of any John Deere dealers could lead to inadequate market coverage, negative customer impressions of John Deere, and may adversely impact John Deere’s ability to collect receivables that are associated with that dealer. ENVIRONMENTAL, CLIMATE, AND WEATHER RISKSUnfavorable weather conditions or natural calamities that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment could directly and indirectly affect John Deere’s business.Poor or unusual weather conditions, particularly during the planting and early growing season, can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of John Deere’s customers, particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment. The timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production. Insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields. Excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting from occurring at optimal times and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth. Temperature affects the rate of growth, maturity, and quality of crops. Temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields and may also affect disease incidence. Natural calamities such as regional floods, hurricanes or other storms, droughts, diseases, and pests, either as a physical effect of climate change or otherwise, have had and could in the future have significant negative effects on agricultural and livestock production. The resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment and the financial condition and credit risk of John Deere’s dealers and customers. Adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region, particularly during the important spring selling season, may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment. Drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes.Governmental actions designed to address climate change and the emergence of new technologies and business models in connection with the transition to a lower-carbon economy could adversely affect John Deere and its customers. There is global scientific consensus that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions continue to alter the composition of Earth’s atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate. These considerations have led to new international, national, regional, and local legislative and regulatory responses. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders, and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, including John Deere, are continuing to look for ways to reduce GHG emissions. The regulation of GHG emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources or the imposition of carbon pricing mechanisms could result in additional costs to John Deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances, required facilities improvements, and increased energy costs, which would increase John Deere’s operating costs through higher utility, transportation, and materials costs. Increased input costs, such as fuel and fertilizer, and compliance-related costs could also affect customer operations and demand for John Deere equipment. John Deere’s financial services is subject to additional international and national European regulations relating to climate and environmental risk, which are continually evolving and could affect the lending operations and climate-risk processes developed by John Deere’s financial services. Regulators in Europe and the U.S. have also focused efforts on increased disclosure related to climate change and mitigation efforts. The SEC has included in its regulatory agenda potential rulemaking on climate change disclosures that, if adopted, could significantly increase compliance burdens and associated regulatory costs and complexity. Increasingly stringent engine emission regulations or bans on internal combustion engines could impact John Deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment, which could negatively affect business results.John Deere’s equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction regulations throughout the world, including the European Union’s Stage V standard which limits the amount of harmful substances in exhaust gases that off-road engines can emit into the environment. In addition, governmental agencies throughout the world are enacting more stringent laws and regulations to reduce off-road engine emissions. These laws and regulations are applicable to engines manufactured by John Deere, including those used in John Deere agriculture and construction and forestry equipment. John Deere has incurred and continues to incur substantial research and development costs related to the implementation of these more rigorous laws and regulations. While John Deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements, these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect John Deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or engines, which could negatively impact business results. Additionally, in certain locations governments have banned or may in the future ban internal combustion engines for some types of products completely. To the extent these bans affect products manufactured and sold by John Deere, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be negatively affected.18Table of ContentsFINANCIAL RISKS Sustained increases in funding obligations under the Company’s pension plans may impair the Company’s liquidity or financial condition.The Company maintains certain defined benefit pension plans for certain employees, which impose funding obligations. The Company uses many assumptions in calculating its future payment obligations under these plans. Significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of return on pension investments being lower than expected. The Company may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future. These factors could significantly increase the Company’s payment obligations under the plans and adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition.Changes in government banking, monetary, and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on John Deere.Policies of the U.S. and other governments regarding banking, monetary, and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity, stabilize financial markets, and/or address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on John Deere’s customers and markets. John Deere’s operations and results could also be affected by financial regulatory reform that could, among other things, have an adverse effect on the financial services segment and on John Deere’s customers by limiting their ability to enter into hedging transactions or to finance purchases of John Deere products. Government policies on spending can also affect John Deere, especially the construction and forestry segment, due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development. John Deere’s operations, including those outside of the United States, may also be affected by non-U.S. regulatory reforms being implemented to further regulate non-U.S. financial institutions and markets. Changes in tax rates, tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a negative effect on John Deere.John Deere is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. John Deere’s domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. John Deere’s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretations. If John Deere’s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount more than amounts previously accrued, John Deere’s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected. The Company’s consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries, creating currency exchange and translation risk.John Deere operates in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. John Deere is subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that its costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which John Deere earns revenues. Additionally, the reporting currency for the Company’s consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of John Deere’s assets, liabilities, expenses, and revenues are denominated in other countries’ currencies, which are then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates in the Company’s reported consolidated financial statements. Therefore, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates affect the value of those items as reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, even if their value remains unchanged in their original currencies. While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego any benefits that may result from favorable fluctuations in such rates. Because John Deere’s equipment operations and financial services segment are subject to interest rate risks, changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment, adversely affect interest margins, and limit access to capital markets while increasing borrowing costs.Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of John Deere’s customers, either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for John Deere equipment and customers’ ability to repay obligations to John Deere. In response to increasing inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates in March 2022 for the first time in over three years, and has signaled it expects to make additional rate increases. Rising interest rates could cause credit market dislocations, which could have an impact on funding costs, which are important to the financial services segment because such costs affect the segment’s ability to offer customers competitive financing rates. While the Company strives to match the interest rate characteristics of its financial assets and liabilities, changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the Company’s net interest rate margin—the difference between the yield the Company earns on its assets and the interest rates the Company pays for funding, which could in turn affect the Company’s net interest income and earnings. In addition, actions by credit rating agencies, such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks, can affect the availability and cost of funding for the Company and can increase the Company’s cost of capital and hurt its competitive position.19Table of ContentsFurther, due to the cessation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), the Company has entered into financial transactions such as credit agreements, receivables, derivatives, and notes that use the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) or the Sterling Overnight Index Average (“SONIA”) as interest rate benchmarks. SOFR and SONIA are calculated differently from LIBOR and have inherent differences, which could give rise to uncertainties, including the limited historical data and volatility in the benchmark rates. The full effects of the transition to SOFR, SONIA, or other rates remain uncertain.Because the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deere’s sales worldwide, negative economic conditions in the financial industry could materially impact John Deere’s operations and financial results.Negative economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates. The financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deere’s sales worldwide. The financial services segment is exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractual obligations and may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The financial services segment’s inability to access funds at cost-effective rates to support its financing activities could have a material adverse effect on John Deere’s business. The financial services segment’s liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital to meet future cash flow requirements and to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities. Additionally, negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels, resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact the financial services segment’s write-offs and provision for credit losses. The financial services segment may also experience residual value losses that exceed its expectations caused by lower pricing for used equipment and higher-than-expected equipment returns at lease maturity.MANUFACTURING AND OPERATIONAL RISKSChanges in the availability and price of certain raw materials, components, and whole goods have resulted and could continue to result in significant disruptions to the supply chain causing production disruptions, increased costs, and lower profits on sales of John Deere products.John Deere requires access to various raw materials, components, and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products. The price and availability of these materials have varied significantly in the last 24 months and are expected to continue to fluctuate due to inflation, geopolitical and economic uncertainty, and regulatory and policy instability, including import tariffs and trade agreements. The latter have the potential to significantly increase production and logistics costs and have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business, particularly if John Deere is unable to recover the increased costs due to market considerations or other factors. John Deere relies on suppliers to acquire raw materials, components, and whole goods required to manufacture its products. Significant disruptions to the supply chain resulting from shortages of raw materials, components, and whole goods has and could continue to adversely affect John Deere’s ability to meet commitments to customers. During fiscal 2022, the supply chain challenges in combination with demand for John Deere’s products resulted in a heavier back-end loaded year for industry retail orders. As the result of the COVID pandemic, geopolitical instability, and other global events, John Deere has experienced changes in the availability and prices of these raw materials, components, whole goods, and freight. Global logistics network challenges include shortages of shipping containers, ocean freight capacity constraints, international port delays, trucking and chassis shortages, and railway and airfreight capacity, which have resulted in delays, shortages of key manufacturing components, increased order backlogs, increased transportation costs, and production inefficiencies from a higher number of partially completed machines in inventory, which increased the Company’s overall production and overhead costs. Increases in such costs have had an adverse effect on John Deere’s business operations. In an effort to mitigate raw material shortages and supply chain constraints, John Deere has increased the list price of its products and worked with suppliers to ensure optimum inventory levels. However, if customers are unwilling to accept price increases in John Deere products or John Deere is unable to offset the increase in costs, raw material shortages could have an adverse effect on John Deere’s operations. Continued or increased fluctuations in costs of materials or inflation generally and continued supply chain challenges could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. Certain materials and components used in John Deere’s products are acquired from a single supplier or are proprietary in nature and cannot be alternatively sourced expeditiously. As discussed under Item 1, “Business - Construction and Forestry,” the Company agreed to voluntarily terminate its joint venture agreement with Hitachi in a transaction that closed in the first half of fiscal 2022. In connection with this termination, John Deere Construction & Forestry Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has entered into a supply agreement with Hitachi pursuant to which Hitachi will continue to provide John Deere-branded excavators, components, and service parts. Any delay or failure by Hitachi to deliver these supplies, or failure by Hitachi to produce such supplies in a manner that meets John Deere’s quality and quantity requirements, could adversely affect John Deere’s business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition or its ability to meet commitments to its customers. 20Table of ContentsDisputes with labor unions have adversely affected John Deere’s ability to operate its facilities as well as its financial results. Many of John Deere’s production and maintenance employees are represented by labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements with different expiration dates. The failure of John Deere to successfully renegotiate labor agreements as they expire has from time to time led, and could in the future lead, to work stoppages or other disputes with labor unions. Disruptions to John Deere’s manufacturing and parts-distribution facilities, through various forms of labor disputes, adversely affect the Company. On October 14, 2021, the UAW initiated a labor strike affecting more than 10,000 workers at 14 John Deere facilities across the U.S. The strike ended after a new collective bargaining agreement was approved on November 17, 2021. The UAW strike had an adverse effect on John Deere’s results of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 because of reduced production and shipments. Any strike, work stoppage, or other dispute with a labor union distracts management from operating the business, may displace employees from ordinary job positions to fill in vacant positions, may affect John Deere’s reputation, and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, and financial condition.RESOURCES RISKS John Deere’s ability to attract, develop, engage, and retain qualified employees could affect its ability to execute its strategy. John Deere’s continued success depends, in part, on its ability to identify and attract qualified candidates with the requisite education, background, and experience as well as its ability to develop, engage, and retain qualified employees. Failure to attract, develop, engage, and retain qualified employees, whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants, difficulty in recruiting new employees, or inadequate resources to train, integrate, and retain qualified employees, could impair John Deere’s ability to execute its business strategy and could adversely affect John Deere’s business. In addition, while John Deere strives to reduce the impact of the departure of employees, John Deere’s operations or ability to execute its business strategy and meet its business objectives may be affected by the loss of employees, particularly when departures involve larger numbers of employees, such as those John Deere could experience if a surge occurs in the number of employees voluntarily leaving their jobs. Higher rates of employee separations may adversely affect John Deere through decreased employee morale, the loss of knowledge of departing employees, and the devotion of resources to recruiting and onboarding new employees. Security breaches and other disruptions to John Deere’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with John Deere’s operations and could compromise the information of John Deere as well as its customers, suppliers, and/or dealers, exposing John Deere to liability that could cause John Deere’s business and reputation to suffer.In the ordinary course of business, John Deere relies upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing, and collection of payments from dealers and other purchasers of John Deere equipment and from customers of the financial services segment. John Deere uses information technology systems to record, process, and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements. Additionally, John Deere collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and the proprietary business information of John Deere’s customers, suppliers, and dealers, as well as personally identifiable information of John Deere’s customers and employees, in data centers, which are often owned by third parties, and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to John Deere’s business operations and strategy. Despite security measures, including a vulnerability disclosure program, and business continuity plans, John Deere’s information technology networks and infrastructure have been and may be vulnerable to intrusion, damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals, employee, supplier, or dealer error or malfeasance, supply chain compromise, disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, ransomware or other malware, telecommunication or utility failures, terrorist acts, natural disasters, or other events. Although John Deere has not suffered any significant cyber incidents that resulted in material business impact, we have from time to time been the target of malicious cyber threat actors. The occurrence of any significant event could compromise John Deere’s networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, obtained, publicly disclosed, lost, altered, misused, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, alteration, misuse or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, government investigations, liability or regulatory penalties, disruption to John Deere’s operations, and damage to John Deere’s reputation, which could adversely affect John Deere’s business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, as security threats continue to evolve and increase in frequency and sophistication, John Deere may need to invest additional resources to protect information security.Security breaches with respect to John Deere’s products could interfere with the business of John Deere, its dealers, and/or customers, exposing John Deere to liability that would cause its business and reputation to suffer.Some of John Deere’s products include connectivity hardware and software typically used for remote system updates. While John Deere has implemented security measures intended to protect against unauthorized remote access to its products, third party security 21Table of Contentsresearchers and malicious threat actors, have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to such products in order to gain control of the products, change the products’ functionality, user interface, or performance characteristics, interfere with the products’ operations, or gain access to data stored in or generated by the products or to systems to which they connect. In addition, reports of unauthorized access to John Deere’s products, systems, and data, regardless of their veracity, may result in the perception that the products, systems, or data are vulnerable to malicious or unauthorized modifications. Any unauthorized access to or control of John Deere products or systems, any loss of data, or any perception that products, systems, or data are vulnerable could result in legal claims or proceedings against John Deere, government investigations, liability or regulatory penalties, which could adversely affect John Deere’s business, results of operations, and financial condition. The potential loss of John Deere intellectual property through trade secret theft, infringement of patents, trademark counterfeitings, or other loss of rights to exclusive use of John Deere intellectual property, could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Infringement of the intellectual property rights of others by John Deere could also have a material adverse effect on the Company.John Deere relies on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, and confidentiality agreements to protect its intellectual property rights. John Deere heavily relies on certain trademarks that contribute to John Deere’s identity and the recognition of its products and services, including but not limited to the “John Deere” mark, the leaping deer logo, the “Nothing Runs Like a Deere” slogan, the prefix “JD” associated with many products, and the green and yellow color combination. These trademarks, as well as the many patents used in our products, are integral to the John Deere business, and their loss could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Additionally, third parties may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of John Deere’s patents or allege that John Deere infringes their patents or proprietary rights. John Deere may incur substantial costs if its competitors or other third parties initiate such litigation, or if John Deere initiates any proceedings to protect its proprietary rights. If the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to John Deere, our business could be adversely affected. LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS John Deere’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations, the violation of which could expose John Deere to potential liabilities, increased costs, and other adverse effects.John Deere’s global operations are subject to numerous international, federal, state, and local laws and regulations, many of which are complex, frequently changing, and subject to varying interpretations. These laws and regulations cover a broad spectrum of subject areas, including advertising; anti–money laundering; antitrust; consumer finance; environmental, climate-related, health, and safety; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; foreign ownership and investment; import/export and trade; human rights, labor, and employment; product liability; and telematics and data privacy and connectivity. These laws may vary substantially within the different markets in which John Deere operates. Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and may further increase the cost of conducting John Deere’s global operations. In addition, John Deere must comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and all applicable foreign anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage, regardless of whether those practices are culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction. Although John Deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that John Deere’s employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or John Deere’s policies and procedures. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in criminal or civil sanctions and have a material adverse effect on John Deere’s reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.Changes to existing laws and regulations or changes to how they are interpreted or the implementation of new, more stringent laws or regulations could adversely affect John Deere’s business by increasing compliance costs, limiting John Deere’s ability to offer a product or service, requiring changes to John Deere’s business practices, or otherwise making John Deere’s products and services less attractive to customers. For example, so-called “right to repair” legislation proposals in certain states and at the federal level in the U.S. could require John Deere to provide access to the software code embedded in its products, which, among other harmful consequences, could result in product safety issues, compromise engine emissions and performance controls, adversely affect the protection of John Deere’s intellectual property rights, and discourage innovation and investments in research and development. Legislative and regulatory changes and other actions that could potentially affect John Deere’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and John Deere may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse effects from such measures.22Table of ContentsJohn Deere is subject to governmental laws, regulations, and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection, and any inability or perceived inability of John Deere to address these requirements could adversely affect our business.The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. John Deere collects personal information and other data as integral parts of its business processes and activities. This data is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including oversight by various regulatory and other governmental bodies. Many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union, China, Canada, and other relevant jurisdictions where John Deere conducts business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal information and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions. The European Union General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the China Personal Information Protection Law, among others, impose stringent data protection requirements and provide significant penalties for noncompliance. New privacy laws will continue to come into effect around the world in the future. Any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations (including at newly acquired companies) could result in additional cost and liability to the Company or Company officials, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and otherwise adversely affect our business.Legal proceedings and disputes in which John Deere is, and may in the future, be involved could harm the Company’s business, financial condition, reputation, and brand. John Deere is subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks around the world. John Deere faces risks of exposure to various types of claims, lawsuits, and government inquires or investigations in the ordinary course of business. The uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved claims and lawsuits may harm John Deere’s business, financial condition, reputation, and brand. The defense of lawsuits and government inquiries or investigations has resulted and may result in the expenditures of significant financial resources and the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations. Such legal proceedings may also affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments exceeding our reserves. In addition to the ordinary course of business proceedings, John Deere is currently subject to a series of antitrust class action lawsuits alleging that it is unlawfully monopolizing the market for repair services for its agricultural equipment. If these lawsuits result in adverse findings for John Deere, we could be exposed to damages and may be required to implement actions impacting our business model.GENERAL RISKSJohn Deere’s reputation and brand could be damaged by negative publicity. John Deere’s brand has worldwide recognition and significantly contributes to the success of its business. John Deere’s reputation is critical to growing its customer base. John Deere’s brand depends on the ability to maintain a positive customer perception of the business, including the core values of integrity, quality, innovation, and commitment. Negative claims or publicity involving John Deere, its products or services, its culture and values, customer data, or any of its key employees or suppliers, could damage John Deere’s reputation and brand image, regardless of whether such claims are accurate. Damage to John Deere’s reputation could adversely impact the ability to attract new and maintain existing customers, employees, dealers, and business relationships. Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings, articles, or comments on social media and the internet about John Deere could generate negative publicity that could damage the reputation of the brand or John Deere. Further, adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against John Deere, or by John Deere, could also damage the reputation and brand image, undermine customer confidence, and reduce long-term demand for equipment, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to John Deere’s operations. If the reputation, culture or image of John Deere’s brands are damaged, or John Deere receives negative publicity, then the Company’s sales, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Unexpected events have and may in the future increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations. The occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including war, acts of terrorism, epidemics and pandemics (such as the COVID pandemic), civil unrest, fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and other forms of severe weather in the United States or in other countries in which John Deere operates, or in which John Deere suppliers are located, have and could in the future adversely affect the Company’s operations and financial performance. Such events have and could cause complete or partial closure of one or more of John Deere manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers, and disruption and delay in the transport of products to dealers, end-users, and distribution centers. Existing insurance coverage may not provide protection from all the costs that may arise from such events.23Table of ContentsThe potential physical impacts of climate change on John Deere’s facilities, suppliers, and customers, and therefore on John Deere’s operations, are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographic regions. These potential physical effects may adversely affect the demand for John Deere’s products and the cost, production, sales, and financial performance of John Deere’s operations"
3,DE,DEERE & CO,2021-12-16,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS.The following risks are considered material to John Deere’s business based upon current knowledge, information, and assumptions. This discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on page 27, including the risks and uncertainties described in the Safe Harbor Statement on pages 37 – 39, and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 49. These risk factors and other forward-looking statements that relate to future events, expectations, trends, and operating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business, while others could affect all of the Company’s businesses. Although the risks are organized by headings and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. The Company, except as required by law, undertakes no obligation to update or revise this risk factors discussion, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. The risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the “Safe Harbor Statement” in this report are not the only risks faced by the Company. Risks Related to the COVID PandemicThe COVID pandemic resulted in additional risks that could materially adversely affect John Deere’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flows.The virus causing COVID was identified in late 2019 and spread globally (COVID pandemic). Efforts to combat the virus have been complicated by viral variants and uneven access to, and acceptance and effectiveness of, vaccines globally. The pandemic resulted in governments and other authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and business closures. These measures have impacted and may continue to impact all or portions of John Deere’s workforce and operations and the operations of customers, dealers, and suppliers. Although certain restrictions related to the COVID pandemic have eased, uncertainty continues to exist regarding such measures and potential future measures. Current material and component shortages have limited and could continue to limit John Deere’s ability to meet customer demand, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.The COVID pandemic caused a global recession and the sustainability of the economic recovery observed in 2021 remains unclear. The COVID pandemic has also significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty, has caused inflationary pressure in the U.S. and elsewhere, and has led to disruption and volatility in demand for John Deere’s products and services, suppliers’ ability to fill orders, and global capital markets. Economic uncertainties could continue to affect demand for John Deere’s products and services, the value of the equipment financed or leased, the demand for financing, and the financial condition and credit risk of John Deere’s dealers and customers. Continued uncertainties related to the magnitude, duration, and persistent effects of the COVID pandemic may significantly adversely affect our business and outlook. These uncertainties include, among other things: the duration and impact of the resurgence in COVID cases in any country, state, or region; the emergence, contagiousness, and threat of new and different strains of virus; the availability, acceptance, and effectiveness of vaccines; additional closures or other actions as mandated or otherwise made necessary by governmental authorities, including employee vaccine mandates; disruptions in the supply chain, including those caused by industry capacity constraints, material availability, and global logistics delays and constraints arising from, among other things, the transportation capacity of ocean shipping containers, and a prolonged delay in resumption of operations by one or more key suppliers, or the failure of any key supplier; an increasingly competitive labor market due to a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover caused by the COVID pandemic; John Deere’s ability to meet commitments to customers on a timely basis as a result of increased costs and supply and transportation challenges; increased logistics costs; additional operating costs due to continued remote working arrangements, adherence to social distancing guidelines, and other COVID-related challenges; increased risk of cyberattacks on network connections used in remote working arrangements; increased privacy-related risks due to processing health-related personal information; legal claims related to personal protective equipment designed, made, or provided by John Deere or alleged exposure to COVID on John Deere premises; absence of employees due to illness; and the impact of the pandemic on John Deere’s customers and dealers. These factors, and others that are currently unknown or considered immaterial, could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, liquidity, results of operations, and financial position.​13Table of ContentsGeopolitical UncertaintiesInternational, national, and regional trade laws, regulations, and policies (particularly those related to or restricting global trade) and government farm programs and policies could significantly impair John Deere’s profitability and growth prospects.International, national, and regional laws, regulations, and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting the import and export of John Deere’s products, services, and technology, or those of our customers, including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors, could harm John Deere’s global business. John Deere’s profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace. Restricted access to global markets impairs John Deere’s ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world and limits the ability to access raw materials and high-quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis. Trade restrictions, including withdrawal from or modification of existing trade agreements, negotiation of new trade agreements, non-tariff trade barriers, local content requirements, and imposition of new or retaliatory tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products, including developments in U.S.-China trade relations, could limit John Deere’s ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair John Deere’s ability to expand the business by offering new technologies, products, and services. These trade restrictions, and changes in–or uncertainty surrounding–global trade policies, may affect John Deere’s competitive position. Furthermore, market access and the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to John Deere’s agricultural and forestry customers. Policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world. John Deere’s agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed by such policies because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world. Furthermore, trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living, which could negatively impact John Deere’s future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food, fuel, and infrastructure. Additionally, changes in government farm programs and policies, including direct payment and other subsidies, can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment as well as create unequal competition for multinational companies relative to domestic companies. Embargoes, sanctions, and export controls imposed by the U.S. and other governments restricting or prohibiting transactions with certain persons or entities, including financial institutions, to certain countries or regions, or involving certain products, limit the sales of John Deere products. Embargoes, sanctions, and export control laws are changing rapidly for certain geographies, including with respect to China, Russia, Myanmar (Burma), and Belarus. In particular, changing U.S. export controls and sanctions on China, as well as other restrictions affecting transactions involving China and Chinese parties, could affect John Deere’s ability to collect receivables, provide aftermarket and warranty support for John Deere equipment, and sell products, and otherwise impact John Deere’s reputation and business. Although John Deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of import and export laws and sanctions, violations of these laws or sanctions could harm John Deere’s reputation and business, and may subject John Deere to civil and criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on John Deere’s results of operations and financial condition.Greater political, economic, and social uncertainty and the evolving globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of John Deere’s competition, customer base, and product offerings and impact John Deere’s growth opportunities globally.John Deere’s efforts to grow its businesses depend in part upon access to additional geographic markets, including, but not limited to, Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Russia, and South Africa, and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in such markets. In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions, and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than John Deere’s other markets. Negative market conditions resulting from economic and political uncertainties in these and other countries could reduce customer confidence, resulting in declines in demand and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could affect write-offs and provisions for credit losses. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes John Deere to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices, business practices, and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change and are often complex and difficult to navigate, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, property ownership rights, taxation, sanctions and export control requirements, repatriation of earnings, and advanced technologies. Expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations, which can materially affect the Company’s financial results. While John Deere maintains a positive corporate image and its brands are widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets, the brands are less well known in some emerging markets, which could impede John Deere’s efforts to successfully compete in these markets. Although John Deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances, John Deere’s reputation and/or business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful.14Table of ContentsUncertain Economic ConditionsNegative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for John Deere’s equipment and services, limit access to funding, and result in higher funding costs.The demand for John Deere’s products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment, cautious consumer spending, lower corporate earnings, U.S. budget issues, and lower business investment. Negative or uncertain economic conditions that cause John Deere’s customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their likelihood of purchasing John Deere’s equipment. As discussed under Risks Related to the COVID Pandemic–The COVID pandemic resulted in additional risks that could materially adversely affect John Deere’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flows, the COVID pandemic caused a global recession and significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. Sustained negative economic conditions and outlook affect housing starts, energy demand, and other construction, which dampens demand for certain construction equipment. John Deere’s turf operations and its construction and forestry business are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions. Decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on John Deere’s results of operations. If negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy, there could be a similar effect on John Deere’s agricultural equipment sales. In addition, uncertain or negative outlook with respect to pervasive U.S. fiscal issues as well as general economic conditions and outlook can cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions. Such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs, which could reduce the Company’s earnings and cash flows. Additionally, the Company’s investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets, which would negatively affect earnings.In addition, demand for John Deere’s products and services can be significantly reduced by concerns regarding the diverse economic and political circumstances of the individual countries in the eurozone, the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, the risk that one or more other European Union countries could come under increasing pressure to leave the European Union, or the long term stability of the euro as a single common currency. Persistent disparity with respect to the widely varying economic conditions within the individual countries in the eurozone, and its implications for the euro as well as market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of John Deere’s euro-denominated assets and obligations, have an adverse effect on demand for John Deere’s products and services in the eurozone, and have an adverse effect on financial markets in Europe and globally. More specifically, it could affect the ability of John Deere’s customers, suppliers, and lenders to finance their respective businesses and access liquidity at acceptable financing costs, if at all, as well as the availability of supplies and materials and the demand for John Deere’s products.Financial RisksChanges in government banking, monetary, and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on John Deere.Policies of the U.S. and other governments regarding banking, monetary, and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity, stabilize financial markets, and/or address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on John Deere’s customers and markets. Failure of the U.S. federal government to pass a 2022 budget resolution could lead to a U.S. default under its sovereign debt, the consequences of which could have significant and unpredictable effects on global financial markets, which could in turn negatively affect John Deere’s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition. John Deere’s operations and results could also be affected by financial regulatory reform that could have an adverse effect on the financial services segment and on John Deere’s customers by limiting their ability to enter into hedging transactions or to finance purchases of John Deere products. Government policies on spending can also affect John Deere, especially the construction and forestry segment, due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development. John Deere’s operations, including those outside of the United States, may also be affected by non-U.S. regulatory reforms being implemented to further regulate non-U.S. financial institutions and markets.  Changes in tax rates, tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a negative effect on John Deere.John Deere is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. John Deere’s domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. John Deere’s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretations. If John Deere’s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of its taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, John Deere’s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected. 15Table of ContentsThe Company’s consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries, creating currency exchange and translation risk.John Deere operates in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. John Deere is subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that its costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which John Deere earns revenues. Additionally, the reporting currency for the Company’s consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of John Deere’s assets, liabilities, expenses, and revenues are denominated in other countries’ currencies. Those assets, liabilities, expenses, and revenues are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, even if their value remains unchanged in their original currencies. Substantial fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar could have a significant impact on John Deere’s results.Because the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deere’s sales worldwide, negative economic conditions in the financial industry could materially impact John Deere’s operations and financial results.Negative economic conditions can have an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates. The financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deere’s sales worldwide. The financial services segment is exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractual obligations and may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The financial services segment’s inability to access funds at cost-effective rates to support its financing activities could have a material adverse effect on John Deere’s business. The financial services segment’s liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash flow requirements and to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities. Additionally, negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels, resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact the financial services segment’s write-offs and provision for credit losses. The financial services segment may also experience residual value losses that exceed its expectations caused by lower pricing for used equipment and higher-than-expected equipment returns at lease maturity.Because John Deere’s equipment operations and financial services segment are subject to interest rate risks, changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment, adversely affect interest margins, and limit access to capital markets while increasing borrowing costs.Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of John Deere’s customers, either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for John Deere equipment and customers’ ability to repay obligations to John Deere. In addition, credit market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs, which are very important to the financial services segment because such costs affect the segment’s ability to offer customers competitive financing rates. While the Company strives to match the interest rate characteristics of its financial assets and liabilities, changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the Company’s net interest rate margin—the difference between the yield the Company earns on its assets and the interest rates the Company pays for funding, which could in turn affect the Company’s net interest income and earnings. Actions by credit rating agencies, such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks, can affect the availability and cost of funding for the Company and can increase the Company’s cost of capital and hurt its competitive position.The transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and the adoption of alternative reference rates could adversely affect John Deere’s business and results of operations.John Deere is exposed to LIBOR-based financial instruments, primarily relating to debt, derivative, and receivables transactions, that have been entered into previously and remain outstanding. The LIBOR benchmark has been subject of national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced its intention to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In November 2020, the Intercontinental Exchange announced its intention to cease publication of certain LIBOR settings by the end of 2021 while continuing to publish overnight and one-, three-, six-, and twelve-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rates through June 30, 2023. However, in early 2021, the United States Federal Reserve Board and other regulatory bodies issued guidance encouraging banks and other financial market participants to cease entering into new contracts that use U.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event no later than December 31, 2021. These actions may cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past and LIBOR will likely ultimately cease to exist. To facilitate an orderly transition from LIBOR to alternative benchmark rate(s), John Deere has established an initiative led by internal subject matter experts to assess and mitigate risks associated with the discontinuation of LIBOR. As part of this initiative, several alternative benchmark rates have been, and continue to be, evaluated. At this time, however, the effects of the phase out of LIBOR and the adoption of alternative benchmark rates have not been fully determined. Any new benchmark rate will likely not replicate 16Table of ContentsLIBOR exactly, which could affect John Deere’s contracts that mature after a LIBOR cessation date. In addition, there is uncertainty about how applicable laws, the courts, or John Deere will address the replacement of LIBOR with alternative rates on variable rate contracts that do not include, or contain unclear, alternative rate fallback provisions. A failure to properly transition away from LIBOR could expose John Deere to various financial, operational, and regulatory risks, which could affect its results of operations and cash flows. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes may also adversely affect the trading market for the Company’s securities.Sustained increases in funding obligations under the Company’s pension plans may impair the Company’s liquidity or financial condition.The Company maintains certain defined benefit pension plans for certain employees, which impose funding obligations. The Company uses many assumptions in calculating its future payment obligations under these plans. Significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of return on pension investments being lower than expected. The Company may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future. These factors could significantly increase the Company’s payment obligations under the plans and adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition.Market ConditionsJohn Deere’s ability to adapt in highly competitive markets could affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition.John Deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets. John Deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. John Deere competes on the basis of product performance, innovation and quality, distribution, customer service, and price. Aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing delays, or John Deere’s failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition.John Deere’s ability to understand its customers’ specific preferences and requirements, and to develop, manufacture, and market products that meet customer demand, could significantly affect its business results.John Deere’s ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers’ anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality, at affordable prices, is critical to its success. This requires a thorough understanding of John Deere’s existing and potential customers on a global basis, particularly in growth markets such as Argentina, Brazil, and India. Failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on John Deere’s business.Changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of bio-energy could affect the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain John Deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements.Changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the world’s growing food and bio-energy demands, driven in part by government policies, including those related to climate change, and a growing world population, are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices, which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment. Lower agricultural commodity prices directly affect farm incomes, which could negatively affect sales of agricultural equipment and result in higher credit losses. While higher commodity prices benefit John Deere’s crop-producing agricultural equipment customers, higher commodity prices also could result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers, which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers. Furthermore, changing bio-energy demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise, with corresponding changes in equipment demands. Finally, changes in governmental policies regulating bio-fuel utilization could affect commodity demand and commodity prices, demand for John Deere’s diesel-fueled equipment, and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards.Manufacturing and OperationsChanges in the availability and price of certain raw materials, components, and whole goods could result in significant disruptions to the supply chain, production disruptions, and increased costs and lower profits on sales of John Deere products.John Deere requires access to various raw materials, components, and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products. Changes in the availability and prices of these raw materials, components, and whole goods, which have fluctuated significantly in the past and are more likely to fluctuate during times of economic volatility, regulatory instability, or change in import tariffs or trade agreements, can significantly increase the costs of production, which could have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business, particularly if John Deere, due to pricing considerations or other factors, is unable to recover the increased costs from its customers. Significant disruptions to the supply chain resulting from shortages of raw materials, components, 17Table of Contentsand whole goods can adversely affect John Deere’s ability to meet commitments to customers. John Deere relies on suppliers to acquire raw materials, components, and whole goods required to manufacture its products.Certain components and parts used in John Deere’s products are available from a single supplier and cannot be alternatively sourced quickly. As discussed under Item 1, “Construction and Forestry,” the Company agreed to voluntarily terminate its joint venture agreement with Hitachi in a transaction that is expected to close in the first half of fiscal 2022. In connection with this termination, John Deere Construction & Forestry Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has entered into a supply agreement with Hitachi pursuant to which Hitachi will continue to provide John Deere-branded excavators, components, and service parts. Any delay or failure by Hitachi to deliver these supplies, or failure by Hitachi to produce such supplies in a manner that meets John Deere’s quality and quantity requirements, could adversely affect John Deere’s business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition or its ability to meet commitments to its customers. In 2020, the COVID pandemic caused a significant reduction in global demand for goods, resulting in widespread cuts in manufacturing capacity and the displacement of workers. As economies around the world have reopened in 2021, sharp increases in demand have created significant disruptions to the global supply chain, which have affected John Deere’s ability to receive goods on a timely basis and at anticipated costs. These supply chain disruptions have been caused and compounded by many factors, including changes in supply and demand, industry capacity constraints, weather conditions, natural disasters, business continuity, labor shortages, the COVID pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and trade conflicts. Global logistics network challenges include shortages of shipping containers, ocean freight capacity constraints, international port delays, trucking and chassis shortages, railway and air freight capacity, and labor availability constraints, which have resulted in delays, shortages of key manufacturing components, increased order backlogs, and increased transportation costs. John Deere actively monitors and mitigates supply chain risk, but there can be no assurance that our mitigation plans will be effective to prevent disruptions that may arise from shortages of materials that we use in the production of our products. Uncertainties related to the magnitude and duration of global supply chain disruptions have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, John Deere’s business and outlook.Supply chain disruptions due to pandemic events, including the COVID pandemic, supplier financial distress, capacity constraints, trade barriers, labor shortages, business continuity, quality, cyberattacks, energy supply, delivery issues, or disruptions due to weather-related events or natural disasters could affect John Deere’s operations and profitability.Data Security and Privacy RisksSecurity breaches and other disruptions to John Deere’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with John Deere’s operations and could compromise the information of John Deere as well as its customers, suppliers, and/or dealers, exposing John Deere to liability that could cause John Deere’s business and reputation to suffer.In the ordinary course of business, John Deere relies upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing, and collection of payments from dealers and other purchasers of John Deere equipment and from customers of the financial services segment. John Deere uses information technology systems to record, process, and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements. Additionally, John Deere collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and the proprietary business information of John Deere’s customers, suppliers, and dealers, as well as personally identifiable information of John Deere’s customers and employees, in data centers, which are often owned by third parties, and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to John Deere’s business operations and strategy. Despite security measures, including a vulnerability disclosure program, and business continuity plans, John Deere’s information technology networks and infrastructure have been and may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals or breaches due to employee, supplier, or dealer error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, terrorist acts, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events. Although John Deere has not suffered any significant cyber incidents that resulted in material business impact, we have from time to time been the target of malicious cyber threat actors. The occurrence of any significant event could compromise John Deere’s networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disruption to John Deere’s operations, and damage John Deere’s reputation, which could adversely affect John Deere’s business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, as security threats continue to evolve and increase in frequency and sophistication, John Deere may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of its systems.18Table of ContentsJohn Deere is subject to governmental laws, regulations, and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection and any inability or perceived inability of John Deere to address these requirements could adversely affect our business.The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. John Deere collects personal information and other data as integral parts of its business processes and activities. This data is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including oversight by various regulatory and other governmental bodies. Many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union, China, Canada, and other relevant jurisdictions where John Deere conducts business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal information and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions. The European Union General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the China Personal Information Protection Law, among others, impose stringent data protection requirements and provide significant penalties for noncompliance. New privacy laws will continue to come into effect around the world in the future. Any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations (including at newly acquired companies) could result in additional cost and liability to the Company or Company officials, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and otherwise adversely affect our business.Security breaches with respect to John Deere’s products could interfere with the business of John Deere, its dealers, and/or customers, exposing John Deere to liability that would cause its business and reputation to suffer.Some of John Deere’s products include connectivity hardware typically used for remote system updates. While John Deere has implemented security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to its products, malicious actors have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to such products through such connectivity hardware in order to gain control of the products, change the products’ functionality, user interface, or performance characteristics, or gain access to data stored in or generated by the products. Any unauthorized access to or control of John Deere products or systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims against John Deere or government investigations. In addition, reports of unauthorized access to John Deere’s products, systems, and data, regardless of their veracity, may result in the perception that the products, systems, or data are capable of being hacked, which could harm John Deere’s brand, prospects, and operating results. John Deere has been the subject of such reports in the past.Intellectual Property RisksThe potential loss of John Deere intellectual property through trade secret theft, infringement of patents, trademark counterfeiting, or other loss of rights to exclusive use of John Deere intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Infringement of the intellectual property rights of others by John Deere could also have a material adverse effect on the Company.John Deere relies on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, and confidentiality agreements to protect its intellectual property rights. In particular, John Deere heavily relies on certain trademarks that contribute to John Deere’s identity and the recognition of its products and services, including but not limited to the “John Deere” mark, the leaping deer logo, the “Nothing Runs Like a Deere” slogan, the prefix “JD” associated with many products, and the green and yellow equipment colors. These trademarks, as well as the many patents used in our products, are integral to the John Deere business, and their loss could have a material adverse effect on the Company.  Additionally, third parties may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of John Deere’s patents or allege that John Deere infringes their patents. John Deere may incur substantial costs if its competitors or other third parties initiate such litigation, or if John Deere initiates any proceedings to protect its proprietary rights. If the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to John Deere, our business could be adversely affected. Similarly, disputes may arise regarding whether John Deere’s products or technologies infringe the proprietary rights of others. Any such infringement could cause third parties, including our competitors, to bring claims against John Deere, resulting in significant costs, possible damages, and substantial uncertainty.Human Capital RisksJohn Deere’s ability to attract, develop, engage, and retain qualified employees could affect its ability to execute its strategy. John Deere’s continued success depends, in part, on its ability to identify and attract qualified candidates with the requisite education, background, and experience as well as its ability to develop, engage, and retain qualified employees. Failure to attract, develop, engage, and retain qualified employees, whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants, difficulty in recruiting new employees, or inadequate resources to train, integrate, and retain qualified employees, could impair John Deere’s ability to execute its business strategy, and could adversely affect John Deere’s business. In addition, while John Deere strives to reduce the impact of the departure of employees, John Deere’s operations or ability to execute its business strategy and meet its business objectives may be affected by the loss of employees, particularly when departures involve larger numbers of employees, such as those John Deere could experience if a surge occurs in the number of employees voluntarily leaving their jobs similar to that experienced by 19Table of Contentsother employers and industries since 2020. Higher rates of employee separations may adversely affect John Deere through decreased employee morale, the loss of knowledge of departing employees, and the devotion of resources to recruiting and onboarding new employees. Disputes with labor unions have adversely affected John Deere’s ability to operate its facilities as well as its financial results. Many of John Deere’s production and maintenance employees are represented by labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements with different expiration dates. The failure of John Deere to successfully renegotiate labor agreements as they expire has from time to time led, and could in the future lead, to work stoppages or other disputes with labor unions. Disruptions to John Deere’s manufacturing and parts-distribution facilities, through various forms of labor disputes, adversely affect the Company. On October 14, 2021, after employees represented by the UAW failed to approve a new collective bargaining agreement between John Deere and the UAW, the UAW initiated a labor strike affecting more than 10,000 workers at 14 John Deere facilities across the U.S., which adversely affected John Deere’s operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The strike ended after a new collective bargaining agreement was approved on November 17, 2021. The UAW strike is expected to have an adverse effect on John Deere’s results of operations for the three months ending January 30, 2022 as a result of reduced production and shipments. Any strike, work stoppage, or other dispute with a labor union distracts management from operating the business, may displace employees from ordinary job positions to fill in vacant positions, may affect John Deere’s reputation, and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, and financial condition.Environmental, Climate, and Weather RisksUnfavorable weather conditions or natural calamities that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment could directly and indirectly affect John Deere’s business.Poor or unusual weather conditions, particularly during the planting and early growing season, can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of John Deere’s customers, particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment. The timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production. Insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields. Excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting from occurring at optimal times and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth. Temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields and may also affect disease incidence. Temperature affects the rate of growth, maturity, and quality of crops. Natural calamities such as regional floods, hurricanes or other storms, droughts, diseases, and pests can have significant negative effects on agricultural and livestock production. The resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment and the financial condition and credit risk of John Deere’s dealers and customers. Adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region, particularly during the important spring selling season, may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment. Drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes.Increasingly rigorous environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations of federal, state, and local authorities in the U.S. and various regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions apply to John Deere’s operations, suppliers, and customers, and enforcement actions or civil litigation related to those requirements could adversely affect John Deere’s business results. Enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental, health, and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigations and legal costs and result in significant fines or penalties. In addition, new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities, including with respect to disclosure relating to climate change risks, could prevent or restrict John Deere’s operations or those of our suppliers and customers, require significant expenditures to achieve compliance, and/or give rise to civil or criminal liability. Further, civil litigation on these subjects continues to increase, primarily in the U.S. There can be no assurance that violations of such laws and/or regulations, civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental, health, or safety impacts of John Deere’s operations or those of our suppliers and customers, or other civil claims in which John Deere becomes a party, would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on John Deere’s business, results of operations, or financial condition.Increasingly stringent engine emission regulations or bans on internal combustion engines could impact John Deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment, which could negatively affect business results.John Deere’s equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction regulations throughout the world, including the European Union’s Stage V standard. In addition, governmental agencies throughout the world are enacting more stringent laws and regulations to reduce off-road engine emissions. These laws and regulations are applicable to engines manufactured by John Deere, including those used in John Deere agriculture and construction and forestry equipment. John Deere has incurred and continues to incur substantial research and development costs related to the implementation of these more rigorous laws and regulations. While John Deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements, these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect John Deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or 20Table of Contentsengines, which could negatively impact business results. Additionally, in certain locations governments have banned or may in the future ban internal combustion engines for some types of products completely. To the extent these bans affect products manufactured and sold by John Deere, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be negatively affected.Governmental actions designed to address climate change and the emergence of new technologies and business models in connection with the transition to a lower-carbon economy could adversely affect John Deere and its customers. The physical effects attributed to climate change could further impact John Deere’s facilities, suppliers, and customers.There is global scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) continue to alter the composition of Earth’s atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate. These considerations may lead to new international, national, regional, or local legislative or regulatory responses. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders, and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, including John Deere, are continuing to look for ways to reduce GHG emissions. The regulation of GHG emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources or the imposition of carbon pricing mechanisms could result in additional costs to John Deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances, facilities improvements, and energy costs, which would increase John Deere’s operating costs through higher utility, transportation, and materials costs. Increased input costs, such as fuel and fertilizer, and compliance-related costs could also affect customer operations and demand for John Deere equipment. Because the impact of any future climate change-related legislative, regulatory, or product standard requirements on John Deere’s global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards, John Deere is unable to predict their potential impact at this time.Customer preferences in the markets served by John Deere could change as these markets transition to less carbon-intensive business models. Demand for electric agricultural, turf, and construction equipment could rise. The development of alternative farming techniques, carbon sequestration technologies, and new low-carbon biofuels could change farmers’ business models and equipment needs. If John Deere fails to properly develop or invest in new technologies to meet changing customer demands, John Deere will be at risk of losing potential sources of revenue, which could affect the Company’s future financial results. The potential physical impacts of climate change on John Deere’s facilities, suppliers, and customers and therefore on John Deere’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographic regions. These may include extreme weather events and long-term changes in temperature levels and water availability. These potential physical effects may adversely affect the demand for John Deere’s products and the cost, production, sales, and financial performance of John Deere’s operations.Legal and Regulatory RisksJohn Deere’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations, the violation of which could expose John Deere to potential liabilities, increased costs, and other adverse effects.John Deere’s global operations are subject to numerous international, federal, state, and local laws and regulations, many of which are complex, frequently changing, and subject to varying interpretations. These laws and regulations cover a broad spectrum of subject areas, including advertising; anti–money laundering; antitrust; consumer finance; environmental, health, and safety, including proper handling of electronic waste, recycling, and climate change; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; foreign ownership and investment; import/export and trade; human rights, labor, and employment; product liability; and telematics and data privacy and connectivity. These laws may vary substantially within the different markets in which John Deere operates. Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and may further increase the cost of conducting John Deere’s global operations. In addition, John Deere must comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and all applicable foreign anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage, regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction. Although John Deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that John Deere’s employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or John Deere’s policies and procedures. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in criminal or civil sanctions and have a materially adverse effect on John Deere’s reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.Changes to existing laws and regulations or changes to how they are interpreted or the implementation of new, more stringent laws or regulations could adversely affect John Deere’s business by increasing compliance costs, limiting John Deere’s ability to offer a product or service, requiring changes to John Deere’s business practices, or otherwise making John Deere’s products and services less attractive to customers. For example, so-called “right to repair” legislation proposals in certain states and at the federal level in the U.S. could require John Deere to provide access to the software code embedded in its products, which, among other harmful consequences, could result in product safety issues, compromise engine emissions and performance controls, adversely affect the protection of John Deere’s intellectual property rights, and discourage innovation and investments in research and development. 21Table of ContentsLegislative and regulatory changes and other actions that could potentially affect John Deere’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and John Deere may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse effects from such measures.Strategic Performance RisksJohn Deere may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of its business strategies, including acquisitions, joint ventures, and divestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected.From time to time, John Deere makes strategic acquisitions and divestitures and participates in joint ventures. Acquisitions and joint ventures that John Deere has entered into, or may enter into in the future, may involve significant challenges and risks, including that the acquisitions or joint ventures do not advance John Deere’s business strategy or fail to produce satisfactory returns on investment. John Deere may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with its operations, applying internal control processes to these acquisitions, managing strategic investments, and assimilating new capabilities to meet the future needs of John Deere’s businesses. Integrating acquisitions is often costly and may require significant attention from management. Furthermore, John Deere may not realize all the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures, or the realized benefits may be significantly delayed. While our evaluation of any potential transaction includes business, legal, and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved, these due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential risks of a particular acquisition or joint venture, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s or joint venture partner’s previous activities or costs associated with any quality issues with an acquisition target's or joint venture’s products or services. John Deere may decide to divest acquired businesses if we determine any such divestiture is in the best interests of our shareholders, and our joint ventures may be terminated at or before their stated terms. Divestitures of businesses or dissolutions of joint ventures may involve significant challenges and risks, including failure to advance our business strategy, costs or disruptions to John Deere, and negative effects on John Deere’s product offerings, which may adversely affect John Deere’s business, results of operations, and financial condition. Divestitures of businesses or dissolutions of joint ventures may result in ongoing financial or legal involvement in the divested business through indemnifications or other financial arrangements, such as retained liabilities, which could affect the Company’s future financial results. In addition, John Deere may not realize all anticipated benefits of its recent reorganization and the implementation of its operating model within the anticipated timeframe or at all. Factors that could affect these benefits include the adoption of new job types within John Deere, changing job responsibilities of employees, the number of layers of management, the ability of employees to embrace change, anxiety within the workforce, and temporary inefficiencies. Further, the ability of John Deere to execute its business strategies in production systems, precision technologies, and aftermarket support could affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  Precision Technology RisksIf John Deere is unable to deliver precision technology and agricultural solutions to its customers, it could affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition. John Deere’s approach to precision technology involves hardware and software, guidance, connectivity and digital solutions, automation and machine intelligence, and autonomy. To create and maintain a competitive differentiation through precision technology solutions, John Deere needs to successfully develop and introduce new precision technology solutions that improve profitability and sustainability for customers through the production systems. John Deere may make significant investments in research and development, acquisitions or other business ventures, data security for precision technology solutions, and employee training. These investments may not produce solutions that provide the desired results for customers’ profitability or sustainability outcomes. In addition, John Deere may depend on third parties to supply components, software, and services in support of precision technology solutions. The dealer channel’s ability to support and service precision technology solutions may affect customers’ acceptance and adoption rates of these products. Further, if John Deere is not able to deliver precision technology solutions with differentiated features and functionality, customers may not adopt technology solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s reputation and business.The reallocation of radio frequency (RF) bands could disrupt or degrade the reliability of John Deere’s high precision augmented Global Positioning System (GPS) or other RF technology, which could impair John Deere’s ability to develop and market GPS- and RF-based technology solutions as well as significantly reduce agricultural and construction customers’ profitability.John Deere’s current and planned integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems, as well as its fleet management telematics solutions for construction equipment, depend upon the use of RF signals. These signals include, but are not limited to, GPS signals, other GPS-like satellite signals, augmented GPS services, and other RF technologies that link equipment, operations, owners, dealers, and technicians. These radio services depend on frequency allocations governed by international and national government agencies. Any international or national reallocation of frequency bands, including frequency bands segmentation 22Table of Contentsand band spectrum sharing, or other modifications concerning the regulation of frequency bands, could significantly disrupt or degrade the utility and reliability of John Deere’s GPS-based products, which could negatively affect John Deere’s ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions. For John Deere’s agricultural customers, the inability to use high-precision augmented GPS signals or other RF signals could result in lower crop yields and higher equipment maintenance, seed, fertilizer, fuel, and wage costs. For construction customers, disrupting GPS or RF applications could result in higher fuel and equipment maintenance costs, as well as lower construction design and project management efficiencies. These cost increases could significantly reduce customers’ profitability and demand for John Deere products"
1,DE,DEERE & CO,2020-12-17,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS.The following risks are considered material to John Deere’s business based upon current knowledge, information and assumptions. This discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 24, including the risks and uncertainties described in the Safe Harbor Statement on pages 27 – 29, and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 44. These risk factors and other forward-looking statements that relate to future events, expectations, trends and operating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change, and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business, while others could affect all of the Company’s businesses. Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. The Company, except as required by law, undertakes no obligation to update or revise this risk factors discussion, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. The risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the “Safe Harbor Statement” in this report are not the only risks faced by the Company. Risks Related to the COVID PandemicThe COVID pandemic resulted in additional risks that could materially adversely affect John Deere’s business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.COVID was identified in late 2019 and has spread globally. The pandemic has resulted in governments and other authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders and business closures. These measures have impacted and may further impact all or portions of the Company’s workforce and operations and the operations of customers and suppliers. Countries around the world have been affected by the pandemic and have taken containment actions. Considerable uncertainty exists regarding such measures and potential future measures. Restrictions on access to the Company’s manufacturing facilities or on the support operations or workforce, or similar limitations for suppliers and dealers, restrictions or disruptions of transportation, port closures, increased border controls or closures, and material and component shortages have limited and could continue to limit the Company’s ability to meet customer demand, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. There is no certainty that measures taken by governmental authorities will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, and the Company’s ability to perform critical functions could be harmed.The COVID pandemic caused a global recession and there is no certainty about when a sustained economic recovery may occur. The COVID pandemic has also significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty and has led to disruption and volatility in demand for the Company’s products and services, suppliers’ ability to fill orders, and global capital markets. Economic uncertainties could continue to affect demand for the Company’s products and services, the value of the equipment financed or leased, the demand for financing and the financial condition and credit risk of our dealers and customers. Uncertainties related to the magnitude and duration of the COVID pandemic may significantly adversely affect our business and outlook. These uncertainties include: the duration and impact of the resurgence in COVID cases in any country, state, or region; prolonged reduction or closure of the Company’s operations, or a delayed recovery in our operations; additional closures as mandated or otherwise made necessary by governmental authorities; disruptions in the supply chain and a prolonged delay in resumption of operations by one or more key suppliers, or the failure of any key suppliers; the Company’s ability to meet commitments to our customers on a timely basis as a result of increased costs and supply challenges; the ability to receive goods on a timely basis and at anticipated costs; increased logistics costs; delays in the Company’s strategic initiatives as a result of reduced spending on research and development; additional operating costs due to remote working arrangements, adherence to social distancing guidelines and other COVID-related challenges; increased risk of cyber attacks on network connections used in remote working arrangements; increased privacy-related risks due to processing health-related personal information; legal claims related to personal protective equipment designed, made, or provided by the Company or alleged exposure to COVID on Company premises; absence of employees due to illness; the impact of the pandemic on the Company’s customers and dealers, and their delays in their plans to invest in new equipment; requests by the Company’s customers or dealers for payment deferrals and contract modifications; the impact of disruptions in the global capital markets and/or declines in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings, which could impact the Company’s ability to obtain funding in the future; and the impact of the pandemic on demand for our products and services as discussed above. It is unclear when a sustained economic recovery could occur and what a recovery may look like. All of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial position.The ultimate magnitude of COVID effects, including the extent of its impact on the Company’s financial and operational results, which could be material, will be determined by the length of time that the pandemic continues, its effect on the demand for the Company’s products and services and the supply chain, as well as the effect of governmental regulations imposed in response to the pandemic. We cannot at this time predict the impact of the COVID pandemic, but it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.11Table of ContentsGeopolitical UncertaintiesInternational, national and regional trade laws, regulations and policies (particularly those related to or restricting global trade) and government farm programs and policies could significantly impair John Deere’s profitability and growth prospects.International, national and regional laws, regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting the import and export of John Deere’s products, services and technology, or those of our customers, including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors, could harm John Deere’s multinational business and subject John Deere to civil and criminal sanctions for violations. John Deere’s profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace. Restricted access to global markets impairs John Deere’s ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world, and limits the ability to access raw materials and high quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis. Trade restrictions, including withdrawal from or modification of existing trade agreements, negotiation of new trade agreements, and imposition of new (and retaliatory) tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products, including developments in U.S.-China trade relations, could limit John Deere’s ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair John Deere’s ability to expand the business by offering new technologies, products and services. These trade restrictions, and changes in–or uncertainty surrounding–global trade policies may affect John Deere’s competitive position. Furthermore, market access and the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to John Deere’s agricultural and forestry customers. Policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world. John Deere’s agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed by such policies because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world. Furthermore, trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living, which could negatively impact John Deere’s future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food, fuel and infrastructure. Additionally, changes in government farm programs and policies, including direct payment and other subsidies, can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment. Furthermore, embargoes, sanctions, and export controls imposed by the U.S. and other governments restricting or prohibiting transactions with certain persons or entities, including financial institutions, to certain countries or regions, or involving certain products, limit the sales of Deere products and expose John Deere to potential criminal and civil sanctions. Embargoes, sanctions, and export control laws are changing rapidly for certain geographies, including with respect to Russia, China, Venezuela, and Nicaragua. In particular, changing U.S. export controls and sanctions on China, as well as other restrictions affecting transactions involving China and Chinese parties, could affect John Deere’s ability to collect receivables, provide aftermarket and warranty support for John Deere equipment, sell products, and otherwise impact Deere’s reputation and business. Although John Deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of import and export laws and sanctions, violations of these laws or sanctions could harm John Deere’s reputation and business, and may subject John Deere to civil and criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on John Deere’s results of operations and financial condition.Greater political, economic and social uncertainty and the evolving globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of John Deere’s competition, customer base and product offerings and impact John Deere’s growth opportunities globally.John Deere’s efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent upon access to additional geographic markets, including, but not limited to, Argentina, Brazil, China, India and Russia, and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in such markets. In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than John Deere’s other markets. Negative market conditions resulting from economic and political uncertainties in these and other countries could reduce customer confidence, resulting in declines in demand and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could affect write-offs and provisions for credit losses. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes John Deere to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices, business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, property ownership rights, taxation, sanctions and export control requirements, repatriation of earnings and advanced technologies. Expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the Company’s financial results. While John Deere maintains a positive corporate image and its brands are widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets, the brands are less well known in some emerging markets which could impede John Deere’s efforts to successfully compete in these markets. Although John Deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances, John Deere’s reputation and/or business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful.12Table of ContentsUncertain Economic ConditionsNegative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for John Deere’s equipment and services, limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs.The demand for John Deere’s products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment, cautious consumer spending, lower corporate earnings, U.S. budget issues and lower business investment. Negative or uncertain economic conditions causing John Deere’s customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their likelihood of purchasing John Deere’s equipment. As discussed under Risks Related to the COVID Pandemic–The COVID pandemic resulted in additional risks that could materially adversely affect John Deere’s business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows, the COVID pandemic caused a global recession and significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. Sustained negative economic conditions and outlook affect housing starts, energy demand, and other construction which dampens demand for certain construction equipment. John Deere’s turf operations and its construction and forestry business are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions. Decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on John Deere’s results of operations. If negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy, there could be a similar effect on John Deere’s agricultural equipment sales. In addition, uncertain or negative outlook with respect to pervasive U.S. fiscal issues as well as general economic conditions and outlook can cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions. Such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs, which could reduce the Company’s earnings and cash flows. Additionally, the Company’s investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets, which would negatively affect earnings.In addition, demand for John Deere’s products and services can be significantly reduced by concerns regarding the diverse economic and political circumstances of the individual countries in the eurozone, the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, uncertainty following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the risk that one or more other European Union countries could come under increasing pressure to leave the European Union, or the long term stability of the euro as a single common currency. Persistent disparity with respect to the widely varying economic conditions within the individual countries in the eurozone, and its implications for the euro as well as market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Company’s euro-denominated assets and obligations, have an adverse effect on demand for John Deere’s products and services in the eurozone and have an adverse effect on financial markets in Europe and globally. More specifically, it could affect the ability of John Deere’s customers, suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses, to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs, if at all, and the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for John Deere’s products.Financial RisksChanges in government banking, monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on John Deere.Policies of the U.S. and other governments regarding banking, monetary and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity, stabilize financial markets and/or address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on John Deere’s customers and markets. John Deere’s operations and results could also be impacted by financial regulatory reform that could have an adverse effect on the financial services segment and on John Deere’s customers by limiting their ability to enter into hedging transactions or to finance purchases of John Deere products. Government policies on spending can also affect John Deere, especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development. John Deere’s operations, including those outside of the United States, may also be affected by non-U.S. regulatory reforms being implemented to further regulate non-U.S. financial institutions and markets.  Changes in tax rates, tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a negative effect on John Deere.John Deere is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. John Deere’s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.  If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, John Deere’s operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. The Company’s consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries, creating currency exchange and translation risk.John Deere operates in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. John Deere is subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that its costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which John Deere earns revenues. 13Table of ContentsAdditionally, the reporting currency for the Company’s consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of John Deere’s assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries’ currencies. Those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency. Substantial fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar could have a significant impact on John Deere’s results.Because the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deere’s sales worldwide, negative economic conditions in the financial industry could materially impact John Deere’s operations and financial results.Negative economic conditions can have an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates. The financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deere’s sales worldwide. The financial services segment is exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractual obligations. The financial services segment may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The financial services segment’s inability to access funds at cost-effective rates to support its financing activities could have a material adverse effect on John Deere’s business. The financial services segment’s liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash flow requirements and to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities. Additionally, negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels, resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact the financial services segment’s write-offs and provision for credit losses. The financial services segment may also experience residual value losses that exceed its expectations caused by lower pricing for used equipment and higher than expected equipment returns at lease maturity.Because John Deere’s equipment operations and financial services segments are subject to interest rate risks, changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment, adversely affect interest margins and limit access to capital markets while increasing borrowing costs.Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of John Deere’s customers, either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for John Deere equipment and customers’ ability to repay obligations to John Deere. In addition, credit market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs which are very important to John Deere’s financial services segment because such costs affect the segment’s ability to offer customers competitive financing rates. While the Company strives to match the interest rate characteristics of our financial assets and liabilities, changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the Company’s net interest rate margin—the difference between the yield the Company earns on its assets and the interest rates the Company pays for funding, which could in turn affect the Company’s net interest income and earnings. Actions by credit rating agencies, such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks, can affect the availability and cost of funding for the Company and can increase the Company’s cost of capital and hurt its competitive position.Changes affecting the availability of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) may have consequences for John Deere that may not yet be reasonably predicted.The Company has outstanding debt, derivative and receivable transactions with variable interest rates based on LIBOR. The LIBOR benchmark has been subject of national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for calculation of LIBOR after 2021.  These reforms may cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past and LIBOR may ultimately cease to exist after 2021. Alternative benchmark rate(s) may replace LIBOR and could affect the Company's debt securities, derivative instruments, receivables, debt payments and receipts. At this time, the effects of any phase out of LIBOR or any adoption of alternative benchmark rates are still unclear. Any new benchmark rate will likely not replicate LIBOR exactly, which could impact our contracts that terminate after 2021. There is uncertainty about how applicable law, the courts or the Company will address the replacement of LIBOR with alternative rates on variable rate retail loan contracts and other contracts that do not include alternative rate fallback provisions. In addition, any changes to benchmark rates may have an uncertain impact on our cost of funds and our access to the capital markets, which could impact our results of operations and cash flows. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes may also adversely affect the trading market for our securities.Sustained increases in funding obligations under the Company’s pension plans may impair the Company’s liquidity or financial condition.The Company maintains certain defined benefit pension plans for certain employees, which impose funding obligations. The Company uses many assumptions in calculating its future payment obligations under the plans. Significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of returns on pension investments being lower than expected. The Company may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future. These factors could significantly increase the Company’s payment obligations under the plans and adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.14Table of ContentsMarket ConditionsJohn Deere’s ability to adapt in highly competitive markets could affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.John Deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets. John Deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. John Deere competes on the basis of product performance, innovation and quality, distribution, customer service and price. Aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing delays or John Deere’s failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect John Deere’s business, results of operations and financial condition.John Deere’s ability to understand its customers’ specific preferences and requirements, and to develop, manufacture and market products that meet customer demand, could significantly affect its business results.John Deere’s ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers’ anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality, at affordable prices, is critical to its success. This requires a thorough understanding of John Deere’s existing and potential customers on a global basis, particularly in Argentina, Brazil, and India. Failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on John Deere’s business.Changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of bio-energy could affect the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain John Deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements.Changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the world’s growing food and bio-energy demands, driven in part by government policies and a growing world population, are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices, which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment. Lower farm commodity prices directly affect farm incomes, which could negatively affect sales of agricultural equipment. While higher commodity prices benefit John Deere’s crop-producing agricultural equipment customers, higher commodity prices also could result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers. Furthermore, changing bio-energy demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise, with corresponding changes in equipment demands. Finally, changes in governmental policies regulating bio-fuel utilization could affect commodity demand and commodity prices, demand for John Deere’s diesel-fueled equipment, and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards.Manufacturing and OperationsChanges in the availability and price of certain raw materials, components, and whole goods could result in significant disruptions to the supply chain, production disruptions, and increased costs and lower profits on sales of John Deere products.John Deere requires access to various raw materials, components, and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products. Changes in the availability and price of these raw materials, components, and whole goods, which have fluctuated significantly in the past and are more likely to fluctuate during times of economic volatility, regulatory instability or change in import tariffs or trade agreements, can significantly increase the costs of production which could have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business, particularly if John Deere, due to pricing considerations or other factors, is unable to recover the increased costs from its customers. Significant disruptions to the supply chain resulting from shortages of raw materials, components, and whole goods can adversely affect John Deere’s ability to meet commitments to customers. For example, during fiscal 2020, some of the Company’s operations were temporarily impacted by certain material or component shortages due to COVID. John Deere relies on suppliers to acquire raw materials, components, and whole goods required to manufacture its products. Certain components and parts used in John Deere’s products are available from a single supplier and cannot be alternatively sourced quickly. Supply chain disruptions due to supplier financial distress, capacity constraints, trade barriers, labor shortages, business continuity, quality, cyber attacks, delivery issues or disruptions due to weather-related, natural disaster, or pandemic events could affect John Deere’s operations and profitability.Data Security and Privacy Security breaches and other disruptions to John Deere’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with John Deere’s operations and could compromise John Deere’s and its customers’ and suppliers’ information, exposing John Deere to liability that would cause John Deere’s business and reputation to suffer.In the ordinary course of business, John Deere relies upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments from dealers or other purchasers of John Deere equipment and from customers of John Deere’s financial services operations. John Deere uses information technology 15Table of Contentssystems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Additionally, John Deere collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of John Deere’s customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of John Deere’s customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to John Deere’s business operations and strategy. Despite security measures and business continuity plans, John Deere’s information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals or breaches due to employee or supplier error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, terrorist acts, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise John Deere’s networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations, and damage John Deere’s reputation, which could adversely affect John Deere’s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, as security threats continue to evolve and increase in frequency and sophistication, we may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of our systems.John Deere is subject to governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection and any inability or perceived inability of the Company to address these requirements could adversely affect our business.The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. John Deere collects personal information and other data as integral parts of its business processes and activities. This data is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including oversight by various regulatory and other governmental bodies. Many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union, Canada, and other relevant jurisdictions where we conduct business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal information and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions. The European Union General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act impose stringent data protection requirements and provide significant penalties for noncompliance. New privacy laws will continue to come into effect around the world in 2021. Any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations (including at newly acquired companies) could result in additional cost and liability to us or company officials, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and otherwise adversely affect our business.Intellectual Property RisksThe potential loss of John Deere intellectual property through trade secret theft, infringement of patents, trademark counterfeiting, or other loss of rights to exclusive use of John Deere intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Infringement of the intellectual property rights of others by Deere could also have a material adverse effect on the Company.John Deere relies on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secret laws, and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. In particular, we heavily rely on certain John Deere trademarks, which contribute to John Deere’s identity and the recognition of its products and services, including but not limited to the “John Deere” mark, the leaping deer logo, the “Nothing Runs Like a Deere” slogan, the prefix “JD” associated with many products, and the green and yellow equipment colors. These trademarks, as well as the many patents used in our products, are integral to the John Deere business, and their loss could have a material adverse effect on the Company.  Additionally, third parties may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents or allege that we infringe their patents. We may incur substantial costs if our competitors or other third parties initiate such litigation, or if we initiate any proceedings to protect our proprietary rights. If the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to us, our business could be adversely affected. Similarly, disputes may arise regarding whether our products or technologies infringe the proprietary rights of others. Any such infringement could cause third parties, including our competitors, to bring claims against us, resulting in significant costs, possible damages and substantial uncertainty.Human Capital RisksJohn Deere’s ability to attract, develop, engage, and retain qualified employees could impact its ability to execute its strategy. John Deere’s continued success depends, in part, on its ability to identify and attract qualified candidates with the requisite education, background and experience. Further, John Deere’s success depends, in part, on its ability to develop, engage, and retain qualified employees. Failure to attract, develop, engage and retain qualified employees, whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants, difficulty in recruiting new employees, or inadequate resources to train, integrate and retain qualified employees, 16Table of Contentscould impair John Deere’s ability to execute its business strategy, and could adversely affect John Deere’s business. In addition, while John Deere strives to reduce the impact of the departure of employees, John Deere’s operations or ability to execute its business strategy may be impacted by the loss of employees, particularly when departures involve groups of employees, such as the voluntary and involuntary separation programs in fiscal 2020. Employee-separation programs may adversely affect the Company through decreased employee morale, the loss of knowledge of departing employees, and the devotion of resources to reorganizing and reassigning job roles and responsibilities. The Company’s ability to meet its business objectives may be affected by the departure of employees, and the expected cost savings of the employee-separation programs may not be achieved due to delays or other factors. Further, the departure of groups of employees could increase the risk to the Company of claims or litigation from former employees.Disputes with labor unions could adversely affect John Deere’s ability to operate its facilities as well as its financial results. Many of John Deere’s production and maintenance employees are represented by labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements with different expiration dates. Disruptions to John Deere’s manufacturing and parts-distribution facilities, through various forms of labor disputes, could adversely affect the Company. In 2021, John Deere will be renegotiating several labor agreements. Any strike, work stoppage, or other dispute with a labor union could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, and financial condition.Environmental, Climate, and Weather RisksUnfavorable weather conditions or natural calamities that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment could directly and indirectly affect John Deere’s business.Poor or unusual weather conditions, particularly during the planting and early growing season, can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of John Deere’s customers, particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment. The timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production. Insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields. Excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting from occurring at optimal times, and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth. Temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields, and may also affect disease incidence. Temperature affects the rate of growth, crop maturity and crop quality. Natural calamities such as regional floods, hurricanes or other storms, droughts, diseases and pests can have significant negative effects on agricultural and livestock production. The resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment. Sales of turf equipment, particularly during the important spring selling season, can be dramatically impacted by weather. Adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment. Drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes.Increasingly rigorous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations of federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and various international regulatory authorities apply to John Deere’s operations, suppliers and customers, and enforcement actions or civil litigation related to those requirements could adversely affect John Deere’s business results. Enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental, health and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigation and legal costs, and result in significant fines or penalties. In addition, new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities could prevent or restrict John Deere’s operations, or those of our suppliers and customers, require significant expenditures to achieve compliance and/or give rise to civil or criminal liability. Further, civil litigation on these subjects continues to increase, primarily in the U.S. There can be no assurance that violations of such laws and/or regulations, civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental, health or safety impacts of John Deere’s operations, or those of our suppliers and customers, or other civil claims in which John Deere becomes a party, would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on John Deere’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Increasingly stringent engine emission regulations could impact John Deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment, which could negatively affect business results.John Deere’s equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction regulations throughout the world, including the European Union’s Stage V standard. In addition, governmental agencies throughout the world are enacting more stringent laws and regulations to reduce off-road engine emissions. These laws and regulations are applicable to engines manufactured by John Deere, including those used in John Deere agriculture and construction and forestry equipment. John Deere has incurred and continues to incur substantial research and development costs related to the implementation of these more rigorous laws and regulations. While John Deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements, these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect John Deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or engines, which could negatively impact business results.17Table of ContentsNew or more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards designed to address climate change could increase costs to John Deere and the physical effects attributed to climate change could further impact its facilities, suppliers and customers.There is global scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) continue to alter the composition of Earth’s atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate. These considerations may lead to new international, national, regional or local legislative or regulatory responses. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, including John Deere, are continuing to look for ways to reduce GHG emissions. The regulation of GHG emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources could result in additional costs to John Deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances, facilities improvements and energy costs, which would increase John Deere’s operating costs through higher utility, transportation and materials costs. Increased input costs, such as fuel and fertilizer, and compliance-related costs could also impact customer operations and demand for John Deere equipment. Because the impact of any future GHG legislative, regulatory or product standard requirements on John Deere’s global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards, John Deere is unable to predict its potential impact at this time.Furthermore, the potential physical impacts of climate change on John Deere’s facilities, suppliers and customers and therefore on John Deere’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions. These may include extreme weather events and long-term changes in temperature levels and water availability. These potential physical effects may adversely impact the demand for John Deere’s products and the cost, production, sales and financial performance of John Deere’s operations.Bribery and Corruption RisksJohn Deere is subject to extensive anti-corruption laws and regulations, the violation of which could adversely affect John Deere.John Deere’s global operations must comply with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act. These anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction. Although John Deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws, violations of these laws could result in criminal or civil sanctions and have an adverse effect on John Deere’s reputation, business and results of operations and financial condition.Strategic Performance RisksJohn Deere may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our business strategies, including acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected.From time to time, the Company makes strategic acquisitions and divestitures or participates in joint ventures. Acquisitions or joint ventures that the Company has entered into, or may enter into in the future, may involve significant challenges and risks, including that the acquisitions or joint ventures do not advance our business strategy, or fail to produce satisfactory returns on our investment. The Company may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with its operations, in applying internal control processes to these acquisitions, in managing strategic investments, and in assimilating new capabilities to meet the future needs of the Company’s business. Integrating acquisitions is often costly and may require significant attention from management. Furthermore, John Deere may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures, or the realized benefits may be significantly delayed. While our evaluation of any potential transaction includes business, legal, and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved, our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential risks of a particular acquisition or joint venture, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s or joint venture partner’s previous activities or costs associated with any quality issues with an acquisition target's or joint venture’s products or services. We may decide to divest ourselves of acquired businesses if we determine any such divestiture is in the best interests of our shareholders, and our joint ventures may be terminated at or before their stated terms. Divestitures of businesses or dissolutions of joint ventures may involve significant challenges and risks, including failure to advance our business strategy, costs or disruptions to the Company, or negative effects on the Company’s product offerings, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. These divestitures of businesses or dissolutions of joint ventures may result in ongoing financial or legal involvement in the divested business, through indemnifications or other financial arrangements, such as retained liabilities, which could affect the Company’s future financial results. In addition, the Company may not realize all anticipated benefits of its reorganization and implementation of its operating model in the anticipated timeframe or at all. The factors that could affect these benefits include the adoption of new job types within the Company, changing job responsibilities of employees, the number of layers of management, ability of employees to embrace change, anxiety 18Table of Contentswithin the workforce, and temporary inefficiencies. Further, the ability of the Company to execute its business strategies in production systems, precision technologies, and aftermarket support could affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  Precision Technology RisksIf John Deere is unable to deliver precision technology and agricultural solutions to its customers, it could affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition. John Deere’s approach to precision technology involves hardware and software, guidance, connectivity and digital solutions, automation and machine intelligence, and autonomy. To create and maintain a competitive differentiation through precision technology solutions, the Company needs to successfully develop and introduce new precision technology solutions that improve profitability and sustainability for customers through the production systems. John Deere may make significant investments in: research and development; acquisitions or other business ventures; data security for precision technology solutions; and employee training. These investments may not produce solutions that provide the desired result for customers’ profitability or sustainability outcomes. In addition, the Company may depend on third parties to supply components, software, and services in the precision technology solutions. The dealer channel’s ability to support and service precision technology solutions may affect customers’ acceptance and adoption rates of these products. Further, if John Deere is not able to deliver the precision technology solutions with differentiated features and functionality, customers may not adopt technology solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s reputation and business.The reallocation of radio frequency (RF) spectrums could disrupt or degrade the reliability of John Deere’s high precision augmented Global Positioning System (GPS) or other RF technology, which could impair John Deere’s ability to develop and market GPS- and RF-based technology solutions as well as significantly reduce agricultural and construction customers’ profitability.John Deere’s current and planned integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems, as well as its fleet management telematics solutions for construction equipment, depend upon the use of RF signals. These signals include, but are not limited to, GPS signals, other GPS-like satellite signals, augmented GPS services and other RF equipment which link equipment, operations, owners, dealers and technicians. These radio services depend on frequency allocations governed by international and national government agencies. Any international or national reallocation of frequency bands, including frequency bands segmentation and band spectrum sharing, or other modifications concerning the regulation of frequency bands, could significantly disrupt or degrade the utility and reliability of John Deere’s GPS-based products, which could negatively affect John Deere’s ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions. For John Deere’s agricultural customers, the inability to use high-precision augmented GPS signals or other RF signals could result in lower crop yields and higher equipment maintenance, seed, fertilizer, fuel and wage costs. For construction customers, disrupting GPS or RF applications could result in higher fuel and equipment maintenance costs, as well as lower construction design and project management efficiencies. These cost increases could significantly reduce customers’ profitability and demand for John Deere products"
2,DE,DEERE & CO,2019-12-19,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS.The following risks are considered the most significant to John Deere’s business based upon current knowledge, information and assumptions. This discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 22, including the risks and uncertainties described in the Safe Harbor Statement on pages 24 – 26, and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 38. These risk factors and other forward-looking statements that relate to future events, expectations, trends and operating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change, and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of 10Table of Contentsbusiness, while others could affect all of the Company’s businesses. Although each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. The Company, except as required by law, undertakes no obligation to update or revise this risk factors discussion, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. The risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the “Safe Harbor Statement” in this report are not the only risks faced by the Company. International, national and regional trade laws, regulations and policies (particularly those related to or restricting global trade) and government farm programs and policies could significantly impair John Deere’s profitability and growth prospects.International, national and regional laws, regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting the import and export of John Deere’s products, services and technology, including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors, could harm John Deere’s multinational business and subject John Deere to civil and criminal sanctions for violations. John Deere’s profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace. Restricted access to global markets impairs John Deere’s ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world, and limits the ability to access raw materials and high quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis. Trade restrictions, including withdrawal from or modification of existing trade agreements, the failure to ratify the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, negotiation of new trade agreements, and imposition of new (and retaliatory) tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products, including developments in U.S.-China trade relations, could limit John Deere’s ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair John Deere’s ability to expand the business by offering new technologies, products and services. These trade restrictions, and changes in–or uncertainty surrounding–global trade policies may affect John Deere’s competitive position. Furthermore, the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to John Deere’s agricultural and forestry customers. Policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world. John Deere’s agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed by such policies because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world. Furthermore, trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living, which could negatively impact John Deere’s future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food, fuel and infrastructure. Additionally, changes in government farm programs and policies, including direct payment and other subsidies, can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment. Furthermore, sanctions and export controls imposed by the U.S. and other governments restricting or prohibiting transactions with certain persons, including financial institutions, to certain countries, or involving certain products expose John Deere to potential criminal and civil sanctions. Embargoes and sanctions laws are changing rapidly for certain geographies, including with respect to Russia, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Turkey.  Although John Deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of import and export laws and sanctions, violations of these laws or sanctions could have an adverse effect on John Deere’s reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.Changes in government banking, monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on John Deere.Policies of the U.S. and other governments regarding banking, monetary and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity, stabilize financial markets and/or address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on John Deere’s customers and markets. John Deere’s operations and results could also be impacted by financial regulatory reform that could have an adverse effect on the financial services segment and on John Deere’s customers by limiting their ability to enter into hedging transactions or to finance purchases of John Deere products. Government policies on spending can also affect John Deere, especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development. John Deere’s operations, including those outside of the United States, may also be affected by non-U.S. regulatory reforms being implemented to further regulate non-U.S. financial institutions and markets.  Changes in tax rates, tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a negative effect on John Deere.John Deere is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. John Deere’s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.  If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, John Deere’s operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. 11Table of ContentsChanging worldwide demand for food and different forms of bio-energy could have an effect on the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain John Deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements.Changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the world’s growing food and bio-energy demands, driven in part by government policies and a growing world population, are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices, which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment. Lower farm commodity prices directly affect farm incomes, which could negatively affect sales of agricultural equipment. While higher commodity prices benefit John Deere’s crop-producing agricultural equipment customers, higher commodity prices also could result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers. Furthermore, changing bio-fuel demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise, with corresponding changes in equipment demands. Finally, changes in governmental policies regulating bio-fuel utilization could affect commodity demand and commodity prices, demand for John Deere’s diesel-fueled equipment, and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards.As John Deere seeks to expand its business globally, growth opportunities may be impacted by greater political, economic and social uncertainty and the continuing and accelerating globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of John Deere’s competition, customer base and product offerings.John Deere’s efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent upon access to additional geographic markets, including, but not limited to, Argentina, Brazil, China, India and Russia, and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in such markets. In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than John Deere’s other markets. Negative market conditions resulting from economic and political uncertainties in these and other countries could reduce customer confidence, resulting in declines in demand and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could affect write-offs and provisions for credit losses. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes John Deere to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices, business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, property ownership rights, taxation, sanctions and export control requirements, repatriation of earnings and advanced technologies. Expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the Company’s financial results. As these emerging geographic markets become more important to John Deere, its competitors are also seeking to expand their production capacities and sales in these same markets. While John Deere maintains a positive corporate image and its brands are widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets, the brands are less well known in some emerging markets which could impede John Deere’s efforts to successfully compete in these markets. Although John Deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances, John Deere’s reputation and/or business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful.John Deere operates in highly competitive markets.John Deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets. John Deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. John Deere competes on the basis of product performance, innovation and quality, distribution, customer service and price. Aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing delays or John Deere’s failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect John Deere’s business, results of operations and financial condition.John Deere’s business results depend largely on its ability to understand its customers’ specific preferences and requirements, and to develop, manufacture and market products that meet customer demand.John Deere’s ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers’ anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality, at affordable prices, is critical to its success. This requires a thorough understanding of John Deere’s existing and potential customers on a global basis, particularly in potentially high-growth and emerging markets, including Brazil, China, India and Russia. Failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on John Deere’s business.Negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for John Deere’s equipment and services, limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs.The demand for John Deere’s products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment, cautious consumer spending, lower corporate earnings, U.S. budget issues and lower business investment. Negative or uncertain economic conditions causing John Deere’s customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their likelihood of purchasing John Deere’s equipment. Sustained negative economic conditions and outlook affect housing starts and other construction which dampens demand for certain construction equipment. John Deere’s turf operations and its 12Table of Contentsconstruction and forestry business are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions. Decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on John Deere’s results of operations. If negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy, there could be a similar effect on John Deere’s agricultural equipment sales. In addition, uncertain or negative outlook with respect to ongoing U.S. budget issues as well as general economic conditions and outlook can cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions. Such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs, which could reduce the Company’s earnings and cash flows. Additionally, the Company’s investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets, which would negatively affect earnings.In addition, demand for John Deere’s products and services can be significantly reduced by concerns regarding the diverse economic and political circumstances of the individual countries in the eurozone, the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, uncertainty related to the anticipated withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the risk that one or more other European Union countries could come under increasing pressure to leave the European Union, or the long term stability of the euro as a single common currency. Persistent disparity with respect to the widely varying economic conditions within the individual countries in the eurozone, and its implications for the euro as well as market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Company’s euro-denominated assets and obligations, have an adverse effect on demand for John Deere’s products and services in the eurozone and have an adverse effect on financial markets in Europe and globally. More specifically, it could affect the ability of John Deere’s customers, suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses, to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs, if at all, and the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for John Deere’s products.The Company’s consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries, creating currency exchange and translation risk.John Deere operates in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. John Deere is subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that its costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which John Deere earns revenues. Additionally, the reporting currency for the Company’s consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of John Deere’s assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries’ currencies. Those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency. Substantial fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar could have a significant impact on John Deere’s results.Because the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deere’s sales worldwide, John Deere’s operations and financial results could be impacted materially should negative economic conditions affect the financial industry.Negative economic conditions can have an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates. The financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deere’s sales worldwide. The financial services segment is exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractual obligations. The financial services segment may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The financial services segment’s inability to access funds at cost-effective rates to support its financing activities could have a material adverse effect on John Deere’s business. The financial services segment’s liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash flow requirements and to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities. Additionally, negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels, resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact the financial services segment’s write-offs and provision for credit losses. The financial services segment may also experience residual value losses that exceed its expectations caused by lower pricing for used equipment and higher than expected equipment returns at lease maturity.John Deere’s equipment operations and financial services segments are subject to interest rate risks. Changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment, adversely affect interest margins and limit the ability to access capital markets while increasing borrowing costs.Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of John Deere’s customers, either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for John Deere equipment and customers’ ability to repay obligations to John Deere. In addition, credit market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs which are very important to John Deere’s financial services segment because such costs affect the segment’s ability to offer customers competitive financing rates. While the Company strives to match the interest rate characteristics of our financial assets and liabilities, changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the Company’s net interest rate margin—the difference between the yield the Company earns on its assets and the interest rates the Company pays for funding, which could in turn affect the Company’s net interest income and 13Table of Contentsearnings. Actions by credit rating agencies, such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks, can affect the availability and cost of funding for the Company and can increase the Company’s cost of capital and hurt its competitive position.The potential loss of John Deere intellectual property through trade secret theft, infringement of patents, trademark counterfeiting, or other loss of rights to exclusive use of John Deere intellectual property may have a material adverse effect on the Company. Infringement of the intellectual property rights of others by Deere may also have a material adverse effect on the Company.John Deere relies on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secret laws, and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. In particular, we heavily rely on certain John Deere trademarks, which contribute to John Deere’s identity and the recognition of its products and services, including but not limited to the “John Deere” mark, the leaping deer logo, the “Nothing Runs Like a Deere” slogan, the prefix “JD” associated with many products, and the green and yellow equipment colors. These trademarks, as well as the many patents used in our products, are integral to the John Deere business, and their loss could have a material adverse effect on the Company.  Additionally, third parties may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents or allege that we infringe their patents. We may incur substantial costs if our competitors or other third parties initiate such litigation, or if we initiate any proceedings to protect our proprietary rights. If the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to us, our business could be adversely affected. Similarly, disputes may arise regarding whether our products or technologies infringe the proprietary rights of others. Any such infringement could cause third parties, including our competitors, to bring claims against us, resulting in significant costs, possible damages and substantial uncertainty.John Deere is subject to extensive anti-corruption laws and regulations.John Deere’s global operations must comply with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act. These anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction. Although John Deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws, violations of these laws could result in criminal or civil sanctions and have an adverse effect on John Deere’s reputation, business and results of operations and financial condition.John Deere’s business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural calamities that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment.Poor or unusual weather conditions, particularly during the planting and early growing season, can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of John Deere’s customers, particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment. The timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production. Insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields. Excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting from occurring at optimal times, and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth. Temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields, and may also affect disease incidence. Temperature affects the rate of growth, crop maturity and crop quality. Natural calamities such as regional floods, hurricanes or other storms, droughts, diseases and pests can have significant negative effects on agricultural and livestock production. The resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment. Sales of turf equipment, particularly during the important spring selling season, can be dramatically impacted by weather. Adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment. Drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes.Changes in the availability and price of certain raw materials, components and whole goods could result in production disruptions or increased costs and lower profits on sales of John Deere products.John Deere requires access to various raw materials, components and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products. Changes in the availability and price of these raw materials, components and whole goods, which have fluctuated significantly in the past and are more likely to fluctuate during times of economic volatility, regulatory instability or change in import tariffs or trade agreements, can significantly increase the costs of production which could have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business, particularly if John Deere, due to pricing considerations or other factors, is unable to recover the increased costs from its customers. John Deere relies on suppliers to acquire raw materials, components and whole goods required to manufacture its products. Certain components and parts used in John Deere’s products are available from a single supplier and cannot be alternatively sourced quickly. Supply chain disruptions due to supplier financial distress, capacity constraints, trade barriers, labor shortages, business continuity, quality, delivery issues or disruptions due to weather-related or natural disaster events could affect John Deere’s operations and profitability.14Table of ContentsJohn Deere’s operations, suppliers and customers are subject to and affected by increasingly rigorous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations of federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and various regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over John Deere’s international operations. In addition, private civil litigation on these subjects has increased, primarily in the U.S.Enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental, health and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigation and defense costs, and result in significant fines or penalties. In addition, new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities could prevent or restrict John Deere’s operations, or those of our suppliers and customers, require significant expenditures to achieve compliance and/or give rise to civil or criminal liability. There can be no assurance that violations of such legislation and/or regulations, or private civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental, health or safety impacts of John Deere’s operations, or those of our suppliers and customers, would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on John Deere’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Increasingly stringent engine emission regulations could impact John Deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment, which could negatively affect business results.John Deere’s equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction regulations throughout the world, including the European Union’s Stage V standard. In addition, governmental agencies throughout the world are enacting more stringent laws and regulations to reduce off-road engine emissions. These laws and regulations are applicable to engines manufactured by John Deere, including those used in John Deere agriculture and construction and forestry equipment. John Deere has incurred and continues to incur substantial research and development costs related to the implementation of these more rigorous laws and regulations. While John Deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements, these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect John Deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or engines, which could negatively impact business results.John Deere may incur increased costs due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards designed to address climate change and could be further impacted by physical effects attributed to climate change on its facilities, suppliers and customers.There is global scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) continue to alter the composition of Earth’s atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate. These considerations may lead to international, national, regional or local legislative or regulatory responses in the future. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, including John Deere, are continuing to look for ways to reduce GHG emissions. The regulation of GHG emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources could result in additional costs to John Deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances, facilities improvements and energy costs, which would increase John Deere’s operating costs through higher utility, transportation and materials costs. Increased input costs, such as fuel and fertilizer, and compliance-related costs could also impact customer operations and demand for John Deere equipment. Because the impact of any future GHG legislative, regulatory or product standard requirements on John Deere’s global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards, John Deere is unable to predict its potential impact at this time.Furthermore, the potential physical impacts of climate change on John Deere’s facilities, suppliers and customers and therefore on John Deere’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions. These may include long-term changes in temperature levels and water availability. These potential physical effects may adversely impact the demand for John Deere’s products and the cost, production, sales and financial performance of John Deere’s operations.Security breaches and other disruptions to John Deere’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with John Deere’s operations and could compromise John Deere’s and its customers’ and suppliers’ information, exposing John Deere to liability that would cause John Deere’s business and reputation to suffer.In the ordinary course of business, John Deere relies upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments from dealers or other purchasers of John Deere equipment and from customers of John Deere’s financial services operations. John Deere uses information technology systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Additionally, John Deere collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of John Deere’s customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of John Deere’s customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to John Deere’s business operations and strategy. Despite security measures and business continuity plans, John Deere’s information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals or breaches due to employee or supplier error or malfeasance or other disruptions during 15Table of Contentsthe process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, terrorist acts, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise John Deere’s networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations, and damage John Deere’s reputation, which could adversely affect John Deere’s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, as security threats continue to evolve and increase in frequency and sophistication, we may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of our systems.John Deere is subject to governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection.The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. John Deere collects personally identifiable information (PII) and other data as integral parts of its business processes and activities. This data is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies. Many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union, Canada, and other relevant jurisdictions where we conduct business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of PII and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions. The European Union General Data Protection Regulation imposes stringent data protection requirements and provides significant penalties for noncompliance. New privacy laws will continue to come into effect around the world in 2020, with one of the most significant being the California Consumer Privacy Act on January 1, 2020. Any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations (including at newly acquired companies) could result in additional cost and liability to us or company officials, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and otherwise adversely affect our business.John Deere’s ability to execute its strategy is dependent upon the ability to attract, train and retain qualified personnel. John Deere’s continued success depends, in part, on its ability to identify, attract, motivate, train and retain qualified personnel in key functions. In particular, John Deere is dependent on its ability to identify, attract, motivate, train and retain qualified personnel with the requisite education, background and industry experience. Failure to attract, train and retain qualified personnel, whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants, difficulty in recruiting new personnel, or the allocation of inadequate resources to training, integration and retention of qualified personnel, could impair John Deere’s ability to execute its business strategy and could adversely affect John Deere’s business. In addition, while John Deere strives to reduce the impact of the departure of employees, John Deere’s operations or ability to execute its business strategy may be impacted by the loss of personnel.Sustained increases in funding obligations under the Company’s pension plans may impair the Company’s liquidity or financial condition.The Company maintains certain defined benefit pension plans for certain employees, which impose funding obligations. The Company uses many assumptions in calculating its future payment obligations under the plans. Significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of returns on pension investments being lower than expected. The Company may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future. These factors could significantly increase the Company’s payment obligations under the plans and adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.Changes affecting the availability of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) may have consequences for John Deere that cannot yet reasonably be predicted.The Company has outstanding debt, derivative and receivable transactions with variable interest rates based on LIBOR. The LIBOR benchmark has been subject of national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for calculation of LIBOR after 2021.  These reforms may cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past and LIBOR may ultimately cease to exist after 2021. Alternative benchmark rate(s) may replace LIBOR and could affect the Company's debt securities, derivative instruments, receivables, debt payments and receipts. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any changes to LIBOR, any phase out of LIBOR or any establishment of alternative benchmark rates. Any new benchmark rate will likely not replicate LIBOR exactly, which could impact our contracts which terminate after 2021. There is uncertainty about how applicable law, the courts or the Company will address the replacement of LIBOR with alternative rates on variable rate retail loan contracts and other contracts that do not include alternative rate fallback provisions. In addition, any changes to benchmark rates may have an uncertain impact on our cost of funds and our access to the capital markets, which could impact our results of operations and cash flows. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes may also adversely affect the trading market for our securities.16Table of ContentsJohn Deere may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected.From time to time, the Company makes strategic acquisitions and divestitures or participates in joint ventures. Acquisitions or joint ventures that the Company has entered into, or may enter into in the future, may involve significant challenges and risks, including that the acquisitions or joint ventures do not advance our business strategy, or fail to produce satisfactory returns on our investment. The Company may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with its operations, in applying internal control processes to these acquisitions, in managing strategic investments, and in assimilating new capabilities to meet the future needs of the Company’s business. Integrating acquisitions is often costly and may require significant attention from management. Furthermore, John Deere may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures, or the realized benefits may be significantly delayed. While our evaluation of any potential transaction includes business, legal, and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved, our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential risks of a particular acquisition or joint venture, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s or joint venture partner’s previous activities or costs associated with any quality issues with an acquisition target's or joint venture’s products or services. We may decide to divest ourselves of acquired businesses if we determine any such divestiture is in the best interests of our shareholders, and our joint ventures may be terminated at or before their stated terms. Divestitures of businesses or dissolutions of joint ventures may involve significant challenges and risks, including failure to advance our business strategy, costs or disruptions to the Company, or negative effects on the Company’s product offerings, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. These divestitures of businesses or dissolutions of joint ventures may result in ongoing financial or legal involvement in the divested business, through indemnifications or other financial arrangements, such as retained liabilities, which could affect the Company’s future financial results.The reallocation of radio frequency (RF) spectrums could disrupt or degrade the reliability of John Deere’s high precision augmented Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, which could impair John Deere’s ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions as well as significantly reduce agricultural and construction customers’ profitability.John Deere’s current and planned integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems, as well as its fleet management telematics solutions for construction equipment, depend upon the use of RF signals. These signals include, but are not limited to, GPS signals, other GPS-like satellite signals, augmented GPS services and other RF equipment which link equipment, operations, owners, dealers and technicians. These radio services depend on frequency allocations governed by international and national agencies. Any international or national reallocation of frequency bands, including frequency bands segmentation and band spectrum sharing, or other modifications concerning the regulation of frequency bands, could significantly disrupt or degrade the utility and reliability of John Deere’s GPS-based products, which could negatively affect John Deere’s ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions. For John Deere’s agricultural customers, the inability to use high-precision augmented GPS signals or other RF signals could result in lower crop yields and higher equipment maintenance, seed, fertilizer, fuel and wage costs. For construction customers, disrupting GPS or RF applications could result in higher fuel and equipment maintenance costs, as well as lower construction design and project management efficiencies. These cost increases could significantly reduce customers’ profitability and demand for John Deere products"
8,DE,DEERE & CO,2018-12-17,"ITEM 1A.        RISK FACTORS.    Thefollowing risks are considered the most significant to John Deere's business based upon current knowledge, information and assumptions. This discussion of risk factors should beconsidered closely in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 20, including the risks and uncertainties described in the Safe Harbor Statement on pages 22and 23, and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 36. These risk factors and other forward-looking statements that relate to future events, expectations, trends andoperating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change, and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertaintiescould affect particular lines of business, while others could affect all of the Company's businesses. Although each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. The Company, except as requiredby law, undertakes no obligation to update or revise this risk factors discussion, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. The risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-Kand the ""Safe Harbor Statement"" in this report are not the only risks faced by the Company.  International, national and regional trade laws, regulations and policies (particularly those related to or restricting global trade) and government farm programs and policies couldsignificantly impair John Deere's profitability and growth prospects.  International, national and regional laws, regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting the import and export of John Deere'sproducts, services and technology, including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors, could harm John Deere's multinational business andsubject John Deere to civil and criminal sanctions for violations. John Deere's profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace. Restricted access to global marketsimpairs John Deere's ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world, and limits the ability to access raw materials and high quality parts andcomponents at competitive prices on a timely basis. Trade restrictions, including withdrawal from or modification of existing trade agreements, negotiation of new trade agreements, and imposition ofnew (and retaliatory) tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products, could limit John Deere's ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international marketsand impair John Deere's ability to expand the business by offering new technologies, products and services. These trade restrictions, and changes in  or uncertaintysurrounding  global trade policies may affect John Deere's competitive position. Furthermore, the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to JohnDeere's agricultural and forestry customers. Policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting 9 Table of Contentstheexport or import of commodities could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative effect on thedemand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world. John Deere's agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed by such policies because farm income strongly influencessales of agricultural equipment around the world, including sales made pursuant to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which was agreed on September 30, 2018 and which is designed toreplace the North American Free Trade Agreement. Furthermore, trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living, which could negatively impactJohn Deere's future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food, fuel and infrastructure. Additionally, changes in government farm programs and policies, including directpayment and other subsidies, can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment. Furthermore, sanctions and export controls imposed by the U.S. and other governments restricting orprohibiting transactions with certain persons, including financial institutions, to certain countries, or involving certain products expose John Deere to potential criminal and civil sanctions.Embargoes and sanctions laws are changing rapidly for certain geographies, including with respect to Russia, Iran, and Venezuela. Although John Deere has a compliance program in place designed toreduce the likelihood of potential violations of import and export laws and sanctions, violations of these laws or sanctions could have an adverse effect on John Deere's reputation, business, resultsof operations and financial condition.  Changes in government banking, monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on John Deere.  Policies of the U.S. and other governments regarding banking, monetary and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity, stabilize financialmarkets and/or address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on John Deere's customers and markets. John Deere's operations and resultscould also be impacted by financial regulatory reform that could have an adverse effect on the financial services segment and on John Deere's customers by limiting their ability to enter into hedgingtransactions or to finance purchases of John Deere products. Government policies on spending can also affect John Deere, especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact ofgovernment spending on infrastructure development. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and its regulations impose, or may impose, additional reporting, stress testing,leverage, liquidity, capital requirements and other supervisory and financial standards and restrictions that increase regulatory compliance costs for John Deere and John Deere's financial servicesoperations and could adversely affect John Deere and its financial services segment's funding activities, liquidity, structure (including relationships with affiliates), operations and performance.Moreover, John Deere's operations, including those outside of the United States, may also be impacted by non-U.S. regulatory reforms being implemented to further regulate non-U.S. financialinstitutions and markets.  Changes in tax rates, tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a negative effect on John Deere.  John Deere is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The Company's domestic and international tax liabilities are dependentupon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. John Deere's effective tax rates could be affected bychanges in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. If theCompany's effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, John Deere's operating results, cash flowsand financial condition could be adversely affected.  Changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of bio-energy could have an effect on the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain John Deereequipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements.  Changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the world's growing food and bio-energy demands, driven in part by government policies and a growing worldpopulation, are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices, which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment. Lower farm commodity prices directly affect farm incomes, whichcould negatively affect sales of agricultural equipment. While higher commodity prices benefit John Deere's crop-producing agricultural equipment customers, higher commodity prices also could resultin greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers. Furthermore, changing bio-fuel demands may cause farmersto change the types or quantities of the crops they raise, with corresponding changes in equipment demands. Finally, changes in governmental policies regulating bio-fuel utilization could affectdemand for John Deere's diesel-fueled equipment and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards.  As John Deere seeks to expand its business globally, growth opportunities may be impacted by greater political, economic and social uncertainty and the continuing and acceleratingglobalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of John Deere's competition, customer base and product offerings.  John Deere's efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent upon access to additional geographic markets, including, but not limited to, Brazil,China, India and Russia, and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in such markets. In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility, greatervulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than John Deere's other markets. Operating and seeking to expand business in anumber of different regions and countries exposes John Deere to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices, business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject tochange, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, property ownership rights, taxation, sanctions requirements, repatriation of earnings and advanced technologies. Expandingbusiness operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the 10 Table of ContentsCompany'sfinancial results. As these emerging geographic markets become more important to John Deere, its competitors are also seeking to expand their production capacities and sales in these samemarkets. While John Deere maintains a positive corporate image and its brands are widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets, the brands are less well known in some emerging markets whichcould impede John Deere's efforts to successfully compete in these markets. Although John Deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances, John Deere's reputation and/or businessresults could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful.  John Deere operates in highly competitive markets.  John Deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets. John Deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers anddistributors that produce and sell similar products. John Deere competes on the basis of product performance, innovation and quality, distribution, customer service and price. Aggressive pricing orother strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing delays or John Deere's failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect John Deere's business, resultsof operations and financial condition.  John Deere's business results depend largely on its ability to understand its customers' specific preferences and requirements, and to develop, manufacture and market products thatmeet customer demand.  John Deere's ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers' anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment andvarious equipment features and functionality, at affordable prices, is critical to its success. This requires a thorough understanding of John Deere's existing and potential customers on a globalbasis, particularly in potentially high-growth and emerging markets, including Brazil, China, India and Russia. Failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices aheadof competitors could have a significant adverse effect on John Deere's business.  Negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for John Deere's equipment and services, limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs.  The demand for John Deere's products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment, cautiousconsumer spending, lower corporate earnings, U.S. budget issues and lower business investment. Negative or uncertain economic conditions causing John Deere's customers to lack confidence in thegeneral economic outlook can significantly reduce their likelihood of purchasing John Deere's equipment. Sustained negative economic conditions and outlook affect housing starts and other constructionwhich dampens demand for certain construction equipment. John Deere's turf operations and its construction and forestry business are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions.Decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on John Deere's results of operations. If negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy, therecould be a similar effect on John Deere's agricultural equipment sales. In addition, uncertain or negative outlook with respect to ongoing U.S. budget issues as well as general economic conditions andoutlook can cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions. Such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs, which could reduce the Company's earnings and cashflows. Additionally, the Company's investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets, which would negatively affect earnings. Inaddition, demand for John Deere's products and services can be significantly reduced by concerns regarding the diverse economic and political circumstances of the individual countries in theeurozone, the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, uncertainty related to the anticipated withdrawal of the United Kingdom from theEuropean Union, the risk that one or more other European Union countries could come under increasing pressure to leave the European Union, or the long term stability of the euro as a single commoncurrency. Persistent disparity with respect to the widely varying economic conditions within the individual countries in the eurozone, and its implications for the euro as well as market perceptionsconcerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Company's euro-denominated assets and obligations, have an adverse effect on demand for John Deere's products and servicesin the eurozone and have an adverse effect on financial markets in Europe and globally. More specifically, it could affect the ability of John Deere's customers, suppliers and lenders to finance theirrespective businesses, to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs, if at all, and the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for John Deere's products.  The Company's consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries, creatingcurrency exchange and translation risk.  John Deere operates in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. John Deere is subject to currency exchange riskto the extent that its costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which John Deere earns revenues. Additionally,the reporting currency for the Company's consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of John Deere's assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in othercountries' currencies. Those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the Company's consolidated financial statements.Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements,even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency. Substantial fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar could have a significant impact on John Deere's results. 11 Table of Contents Because the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deere's sales worldwide, John Deere's operations and financial results could be impactedmaterially should negative economic conditions affect the financial industry.  Negative economic conditions can have an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates. The financial servicessegment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deere's sales worldwide. The financial services segment is exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractualobligations. The financial services segment may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The financial servicessegment's inability to access funds at cost-effective rates to support its financing activities could have a material adverse effect on John Deere's business. The financial services segment'sliquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash flow requirements and to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversifiedfunding activities. Additionally, negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels, resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates,which could materially impact the financial services segment's write-offs and provision for credit losses. The financial services segment may also experience residual value losses that exceed itsexpectations caused by lower pricing for used equipment and higher than expected equipment returns at lease maturity.  John Deere's equipment operations and financial services segments are subject to interest rate risks. Changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment, adversely affectinterest margins and limit the ability to access capital markets while increasing borrowing costs.  Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of John Deere's customers, either or both ofwhich could negatively affect customer demand for John Deere equipment and customers' ability to repay obligations to John Deere. In addition, credit market dislocations could have an impact onfunding costs which are very important to John Deere's financial services segment because such costs affect the segment's ability to offer customers competitive financing rates. While the Companystrives to match the interest rate characteristics of our financial assets and liabilities, changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the Company's net interest ratemargin  the difference between the yield the Company earns on its assets and the interest rates the Company pays for funding, which could in turn affect the Company's net interestincome and earnings. Actions by credit rating agencies, such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks, can affect the availability and cost of funding for the Company and can increase theCompany's cost of capital and hurt its competitive position.  The potential loss of John Deere intellectual property through trade secret theft, infringement of patents, trademark counterfeiting, or other loss of rights to exclusive use of JohnDeere intellectual property may have a material adverse effect on the Company. Infringement of the intellectual property rights of others by Deere may also have a material adverse effect on theCompany.  John Deere relies on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secret laws, and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. Inparticular, we heavily rely on certain John Deere trademarks, which contribute to John Deere's identity and the recognition of its products and services, including but not limited to the ""John Deere""mark, the leaping deer logo, the ""Nothing Runs Like a Deere"" slogan, the prefix ""JD"" associated with many products, and the green and yellow equipment colors. These trademarks, as well as the manypatents used in our products, are integral to the John Deere business, and their loss could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Additionally,third parties may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents or allege that we infringe their patents. We may incur substantial costs if our competitors or other thirdparties initiate such litigation, or if we initiate any proceedings to protect our proprietary rights. If the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to us, our business could be adverselyaffected. Similarly, disputes may arise regarding whether our products or technologies infringe the proprietary rights of others. Any such infringement could cause third parties, including ourcompetitors, to bring claims against us, resulting in significant costs, possible damages and substantial uncertainty.  John Deere is subject to extensive anti-corruption laws and regulations.  John Deere's global operations must comply with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act.These anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or privateindividuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction. Although John Deere hasa compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws, violations of these laws could result in criminal or civil sanctions and have an adverse effect onJohn Deere's reputation, business and results of operations and financial condition.  John Deere's business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for agricultureand turf equipment.  Poor or unusual weather conditions, particularly during the planting and early growing season, can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of JohnDeere's customers, particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment. The timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production. Insufficientlevels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields. Excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting from occurring at optimal times,and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth. Temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields, and may also affect disease incidence. Temperatureaffects the rate of growth, crop maturity and crop quality. Natural calamities such as regional floods, hurricanes or other storms, and droughts can have significant negative effects on 12 Table of Contentsagriculturaland livestock production. The resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment. Sales of turf equipment, particularly during the importantspring selling season, can be dramatically impacted by weather. Adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment. Drought conditions canadversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes.  Changes in the availability and price of certain raw materials, components and whole goods could result in production disruptions or increased costs and lower profits on sales ofJohn Deere products.  John Deere requires access to various raw materials, components and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products. Changes inthe availability and price of these raw materials, components and whole goods, which have fluctuated significantly in the past and are more likely to fluctuate during times of economic volatility,regulatory instability or change in custom tariffs, can significantly increase the costs of production which could have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business, particularly ifJohn Deere, due to pricing considerations or other factors, is unable to recover the increased costs from its customers. John Deere relies on suppliers to acquire raw materials, components and wholegoods required to manufacture its products. Certain components and parts used in John Deere's products are available from a single supplier and cannot be alternatively sourced quickly. Supply chaindisruptions due to supplier financial distress, capacity constraints, labor shortages, business continuity, quality, delivery or disruptions due to weather-related or natural disaster events couldaffect John Deere's operations and profitability.  John Deere's operations, suppliers and customers are subject to and affected by increasingly rigorous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations of federal, state andlocal authorities in the U.S. and various regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over John Deere's international operations. In addition, private civil litigation on these subjects has increased,primarily in the U.S.  Enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental, health and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigation and defense costs, and result insignificant fines or penalties. In addition, new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities could prevent or restrict John Deere's operations, or those of our suppliers and customers,requiresignificant expenditures to achieve compliance and/or give rise to civil or criminal liability. There can be no assurance that violations of such legislation and/or regulations, or private civilclaims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental, health or safety impacts of John Deere's operations, or those of our suppliers and customers, would not haveconsequences that result in a material adverse effect on John Deere's business, financial condition or results of operations.  Increasingly stringent engine emission regulations could impact John Deere's ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment, which could negatively affectbusiness results.  John Deere's equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction regulations throughout the world, including the European Union'sStage V standard. In addition, governmental agencies throughout the world are enacting more stringent laws and regulations to reduce off-road engine emissions. These laws and regulations areapplicable to engines manufactured by John Deere, including those used in John Deere agriculture and construction and forestry equipment. John Deere has incurred and continues to incur substantialresearch and development costs related to the implementation of these more rigorous laws and regulations. While John Deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet theserequirements, these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect John Deere's ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or engines, which could negativelyimpact business results.  John Deere may incur increased costs due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards designed to address climate change and could be further impacted by physicaleffects attributed to climate change on its facilities, suppliers and customers.  There is global scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) continue to alter the composition of Earth's atmosphere in ways that areaffecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate. These considerations may lead to international, national, regional or local legislative or regulatory responses in the future.Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, including John Deere, are considering waysto reduce GHG emissions. The regulation of GHG emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources could result in additional costs to John Deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances,facilities improvements and energy costs, which would increase John Deere's operating costs through higher utility, transportation and materials costs. Increased input costs, such as fuel andfertilizer, and compliance-related costs could also impact customer operations and demand for John Deere equipment. Because the impact of any future GHG legislative, regulatory or product standardrequirements on John Deere's global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards, John Deere is unable to predict its potential impact at this time. Furthermore,the potential physical impacts of climate change on John Deere's facilities, suppliers and customers and therefore on John Deere's operations are highly uncertain and will be particularto the circumstances developing in various geographical regions. These may include long-term changes in temperature levels and water availability. These potential physical effects may adversely impactthe demand for John Deere's products and the cost, production, sales and financial performance of John Deere's operations. 13 Table of Contents  Security breaches and other disruptions to John Deere's information technology infrastructure could interfere with John Deere's operations and could compromise John Deere's and itscustomers' and suppliers' information, exposing John Deere to liability that would cause John Deere's business and reputation to suffer.  In the ordinary course of business, John Deere relies upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, toprocess, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing andcollection of payments from dealers or other purchasers of John Deere equipment and from customers of John Deere's financial services operations. John Deere uses information technology systems torecord, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements.Additionally, John Deere collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of John Deere's customers andsuppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of John Deere's customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these informationtechnology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to John Deere's business operations and strategy. Despite security measures and business continuity plans, JohnDeere's information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance orother disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, terrorist acts, natural disastersor other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise John Deere's networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Anysuch access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disruptoperations, and damage John Deere's reputation, which could adversely affect John Deere's business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, as security threats continue to evolveand increase in frequency and sophistication, we may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of our systems.  John Deere is subject to governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection.  The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for theforeseeable future. John Deere collects personally identifiable information (PII) and other data as integral parts of its business processes and activities. This data is subject to a variety of U.S.and international laws and regulations, including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies. Many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union, Canada,and other relevant jurisdictions where we conduct business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of PII and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operatingwithin their jurisdiction that are more restrictive than those in the U.S. Additionally, in May 2016, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation that imposes more stringent dataprotection requirements and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance. Any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, even if unfounded, orcomply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations (including at newly acquired companies) could result in additional cost andliability to us or company officials, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and otherwise adversely affect our business.  John Deere's ability to execute its strategy is dependent upon the ability to attract, train and retain qualified personnel.  John Deere's continued success depends, in part, on its ability to identify, attract, motivate, train and retain qualified personnel in key functions. Inparticular, John Deere is dependent on its ability to identify, attract, motivate, train and retain qualified personnel with the requisite education, background and industry experience. Failure toattract, train and retain qualified personnel, whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants, difficulty in recruiting new personnel, or the allocation of inadequate resourcesto training, integration and retention of qualified personnel, could impair John Deere's ability to execute its business strategy and could adversely affect John Deere's business. In addition, whileJohn Deere strives to reduce the impact of the departure of employees, John Deere's operations or ability to execute its business strategy may be impacted by the loss of personnel.  Sustained increases in funding obligations under the Company's pension plans may impair the Company's liquidity or financial condition.  The Company maintains certain defined benefit pension plans for certain employees, which impose funding obligations. The Company uses many assumptions incalculating its future payment obligations under the plans. Significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of returns on pension investments being lower thanexpected. The Company may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future. These factors could significantly increase the Company's payment obligations under the plansand adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.  John Deere may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected.  From time to time, the Company makes strategic acquisitions and divestitures  such as its acquisition of the WirtgenGroup  or participates in joint ventures. Transactions that the Company has entered into, or may enter into in the future, may involve significant challenges and risks, includingthat the transactions do not advance our business strategy, or fail to produce satisfactory returns on our investment. The Company may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with itsoperations, in applying internal control processes to these acquisitions, in managing strategic investments, and in assimilating new capabilities to meet the future needs of the Company's business.Integrating acquisitions is often costly and may require significant attention from management. Furthermore, 14 Table of ContentsJohnDeere may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of these transactions, or the realized benefits may be significantly delayed. While our evaluation of any potential transaction includesbusiness, legal, and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved, our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary toaccurately estimate the cost and potential risks of a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target's previous activities or costsassociated with any quality issues with an acquisition target's products or services.  The reallocation of radio frequency (RF) spectrums could disrupt or degrade the reliability of John Deere's high precision augmented Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, whichcould impair John Deere's ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions as well as significantly reduce agricultural and construction customers' profitability.  John Deere's current and planned integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems, as well as its fleet management telematics solutions forconstruction equipment, depend upon the use of RF signals. These signals include, but are not limited to, GPS signals, other GPS-like satellite signals, augmented GPS services andother RF equipment which link equipment, operations, owners, dealers and technicians. These radio services depend on frequency allocations governed by international and national agencies. Anyinternational or national reallocation of frequency bands, including frequency bands segmentation and band spectrum sharing, or other modifications concerning the regulation of frequency bands, couldsignificantly disrupt or degrade the utility and reliability of John Deere's GPS-based products, which could negatively affect John Deere's ability to develop and market GPS-basedtechnology solutions. For John Deere's agricultural customers, the inability to use high-precision augmented GPS signals or other RF signals could result in lower crop yields and higherequipment maintenance, seed, fertilizer, fuel and wage costs. For construction customers, disrupting GPS or RF applications could result in higher fuel and equipment maintenance costs, as wellas lower construction design and project management efficiencies. These cost increases could significantly reduce customers' profitability and demand for John Deere products"
16,DE,DEERE & CO,2017-12-18,"ITEM 1A.        RISK FACTORS.    Thefollowing risks are considered the most significant to John Deere's business based upon current knowledge, information and assumptions. This discussion of risk factors should beconsidered closely in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 19, including the risks and uncertainties described in the Safe Harbor Statement on pages 21and 22, and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 34. These risk factors and other forward-looking statements that relate to future events, expectations, trends andoperating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change, and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertaintiescould affect particular lines of business, while others could affect all of the Company's businesses. Although each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. The Company, except as requiredby law, undertakes no obligation to update or revise this risk factors discussion, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. The risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-Kand the ""Safe Harbor Statement"" in this report are not the only risks faced by the Company.  International, national and regional trade laws, regulations and policies (particularly those related to or restricting global trade) and government farm programs and policies couldsignificantly impair John Deere's profitability and growth prospects.  International, national and regional laws, regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting the import and export of John Deere'sproducts, services and technology, including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors, could harm John Deere's multinational business andsubject John Deere to civil and criminal sanctions for violations. John Deere's profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace. Restricted access to global marketsimpairs John Deere's ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world, and limits the ability to access raw materials and high quality parts andcomponents at competitive prices on a timely basis. Trade restrictions, including potential limitations on existing trade agreements and trade terms, could limit John Deere's ability to capitalize oncurrent and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair John Deere's ability to expand the business by offering new technologies, products and services. These restrictions mayaffect John Deere's competitive position. Additionally, John Deere's competitive position and results could be adversely affected by changes inor uncertainty surroundingU.S.trade policy. Furthermore, the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to John Deere's agricultural and forestry customers. Policies 9 Table of Contentsimpactingexchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commoditiesthat may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world. John Deere's agricultural equipment sales could be especiallyharmed by such policies because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world, including the withdrawal or material modification of the North American Free TradeAgreement. Furthermore, trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living, which could negatively impact John Deere's future growth opportunitiesarising from increasing global demand for food, fuel and infrastructure. Additionally, changes in government farm programs and policies, including direct payment and other subsidies, can significantlyinfluence demand for agricultural equipment. Furthermore, sanctions and export controls imposed by the U.S. and other governments restricting or prohibiting transactions with certain persons,including financial institutions, to certain countries, or involving certain products expose John Deere to potential criminal and civil sanctions. Embargoes and sanctions laws are changing rapidly forcertain geographies, including with respect to Russia, Cuba, Iran, and Sudan. Although John Deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of importand export laws and sanctions, violations of these laws or sanctions could have an adverse effect on John Deere's reputation, business and results of operations and financial condition.  Changes in government banking, monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on John Deere.  Policies of the U.S. and other governments regarding banking, monetary and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity, stabilize financialmarkets and/or address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on John Deere's customers and markets. John Deere's operations and resultscould also be impacted by financial regulatory reform that could have an adverse effect on the financial services segment and on John Deere's customers by limiting their ability to enter into hedgingtransactions or to finance purchases of John Deere products. Government policies on spending can also affect John Deere, especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact ofgovernment spending on infrastructure development. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and its regulations impose, or may impose, additional reporting, stress testing,leverage, liquidity, capital requirements and other supervisory and financial standards and restrictions that increase regulatory compliance costs for John Deere and John Deere's financial servicesoperations and could adversely affect John Deere and its financial services segment's funding activities, liquidity, structure (including relationships withaffiliates), operations and performance. Moreover, John Deere's operations, including those outside of the United States, may also be impacted by non-U.S. regulatory reforms being implemented tofurther regulate non-U.S. financial institutions and markets.  Changes in tax rates, tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a negative effect on John Deere.  John Deere is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The Company's domestic and international tax liabilities are dependentupon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. John Deere's effective tax rates could be affected bychanges in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. If theCompany's effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, John Deere's operating results, cash flowsand financial condition could be adversely affected.  Changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of bio-energy could have an effect on the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain John Deereequipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements.  Changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the world's growing food and bio-energy demands, driven in part by government policies and a growing worldpopulation, are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices, which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment. Lower farm commodity prices directly affect farm incomes, whichcould negatively affect sales of agricultural equipment. While higher commodity prices benefit John Deere's crop-producing agricultural equipment customers, higher commodity prices also could resultin greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers. Furthermore, changing bio-fuel demands may cause farmersto change the types or quantities of the crops they raise, with corresponding changes in equipment demands. Finally, changes in governmental policies regulating bio-fuel utilization could affectdemand for John Deere's diesel-fueled equipment and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards.  As John Deere seeks to expand its business globally, growth opportunities may be impacted by greater political, economic and social uncertainty and the continuing and acceleratingglobalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of John Deere's competition, customer base and product offerings.  John Deere's efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent upon access to additional geographic markets, including, but not limited to, Brazil,China, India and Russia, and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in such markets. In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility, greatervulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than John Deere's other markets. Operating and seeking to expand business in anumber of different regions and countries exposes John Deere to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices, business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject tochange, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, property ownership rights, taxation, sanctions requirements, repatriation of earnings and advanced technologies. Expandingbusiness operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the 10 Table of ContentsCompany'sfinancial results. As these emerging geographic markets become more important to John Deere, its competitors are also seeking to expand their production capacities and sales in these samemarkets. While John Deere maintains a positive corporate image and the John Deere brand is widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets, the brand is less well known in some emergingmarkets which could impede John Deere's efforts to successfully compete in these markets. Although John Deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances, John Deere's reputationand/or business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful.  John Deere operates in highly competitive markets.  John Deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets. John Deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers anddistributors that produce and sell similar products. John Deere competes on the basis of product performance, innovation and quality, distribution, customer service and price. Aggressive pricing orother strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing delays or John Deere's failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect John Deere's business, resultsof operations and financial condition.  John Deere's business results depend largely on its ability to understand its customers' specific preferences and requirements, and to develop, manufacture and market products thatmeet customer demand.  John Deere's ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers' anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment andvarious equipment features and functionality, at affordable prices, is critical to its success. This requires a thorough understanding of John Deere's existing and potential customers on a globalbasis, particularly in potentially high-growth and emerging markets, including Brazil, China, India and Russia. Failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices aheadof competitors could have a significant adverse effect on John Deere's business.  Negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for John Deere's equipment and services, limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs.  The demand for John Deere's products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment, cautiousconsumer spending, lower corporate earnings, U.S. budget issues and lower business investment. Negative or uncertain economic conditions causing John Deere's customers to lack confidence in thegeneral economic outlook can significantly reduce their likelihood of purchasing John Deere's equipment. Sustained negative economic conditions and outlook affect housing starts and other constructionwhich dampens demand for certain construction equipment. John Deere's turf operations and its construction and forestry business are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions.Decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on John Deere's results of operations. If negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy, therecould be a similar effect on John Deere's agricultural equipment sales. In addition, uncertain or negative outlook with respect to ongoing U.S. budget issues as well as general economic conditions andoutlook can cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions. Such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs, which could reduce the Company's earnings and cashflows. Additionally, the Company's investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets, which would negatively affect earnings. Inaddition, demand for John Deere's products and services can be significantly reduced by concerns regarding the diverse economic and political circumstances of the individual countries in theeurozone, the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, uncertainty related to the anticipated withdrawal of the United Kingdom from theEuropean Union, the risk that one or more other European Union countries could come under increasing pressure to leave the European Union, or the long term stability of the euro as a single commoncurrency. Persistent disparity with respect to the widely varying economic conditions within the individual countries in the eurozone, and its implications for the euro as well as market perceptionsconcerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Company's euro-denominated assets and obligations, have an adverse effect on demand for John Deere's products and servicesin the eurozone and have an adverse effect on financial markets in Europe and globally. More specifically, it could affect the ability of John Deere's customers, suppliers and lenders to finance theirrespective businesses, to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs, if at all, and the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for John Deere's products.  The Company's consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries, creatingcurrency exchange and translation risk.  John Deere operates in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. John Deere is subject to currency exchange riskto the extent that its costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which John Deere earns revenues. Additionally,the reporting currency for the Company's consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of John Deere's assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in othercountries' currencies. Those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the Company's consolidated financial statements.Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements,even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency. Substantial fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar could have a significant impact on John Deere's results. 11 Table of Contents  Because the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deere's sales worldwide, John Deere's operations and financial results could be impactedmaterially should negative economic conditions affect the financial industry.  Negative economic conditions can have an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates. The financial servicessegment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deere's sales worldwide. The financial services segment is exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractualobligations. The financial services segment may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The financial servicessegment's inability to access funds at cost-effective rates to support its financing activities could have a material adverse effect on John Deere's business. The financial services segment'sliquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash flow requirements and to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversifiedfunding activities. Additionally, negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels, resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates,which could materially impact the financial services segment's write-offs and provision for credit losses. The financial services segment may also experience residual value losses that exceed itsexpectations caused by lower pricing for used equipment and higher than expected equipment returns at lease maturity.  John Deere's equipment operations and financial services segments are subject to interest rate risks. Changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment, adversely affectinterest margins and limit the ability to access capital markets while increasing borrowing costs.  Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of John Deere's customers, either or both ofwhich could negatively affect customer demand for John Deere equipment and customers' ability to repay obligations to John Deere. In addition, credit market dislocations could have an impact onfunding costs which are very important to John Deere's financial services segment because such costs affect the segment's ability to offer customers competitive financing rates. While the Companystrives to match the interest rate characteristics of our financial assets and liabilities, changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the Company's net interest ratemarginthe difference between the yield the Company earns on its assets and the interest rates the Company pays for funding, which could in turn affect the Company's net interest incomeand earnings. Actions by credit rating agencies, such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks, can affect the availability and cost of funding for the Company and can increase theCompany's cost of capital and hurt its competitive position.  The potential loss of John Deere intellectual property through trade secret theft, infringement of patents, trademark counterfeiting, or other loss of rights to exclusive use of JohnDeere intellectual property may have a material adverse effect on the Company. Infringement of the intellectual property rights of others by Deere may also have a material adverse effect on theCompany.  John Deere relies on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secret laws, and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. Inparticular, we heavily rely on certain John Deere trademarks, which contribute to John Deere's identity and the recognition of its products and services, including but not limited to the ""John Deere""mark, the leaping deer logo, the ""Nothing Runs Like a Deere"" slogan and the prefix ""JD"" associated with many products and the green and yellow equipment colors. These trademarks, as well as the manypatents used in our products, are integral to the John Deere business, and their loss could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Additionally,third parties may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents or allege that we infringe their patents. We may incur substantial costs if our competitors or other thirdparties initiate such litigation, or if we initiate any proceedings to protect our proprietary rights. If the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to us, our business could be adverselyaffected. Similarly, disputes may arise regarding whether our products or technologies infringe the proprietary rights of others. Any such infringement could cause third parties, including ourcompetitors, to bring claims against us, resulting in significant costs, possible damages and substantial uncertainty. John Deere is subject to extensive anti-corruption laws and regulations.  John Deere's global operations must comply with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act.These anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or privateindividuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction. Recently, there has beena substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Although John Deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws,violations of these laws could result in criminal or civil sanctions and have an adverse effect on John Deere's reputation, business and results of operations and financial condition. John Deere's business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or naturaldisasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment.  Poor or unusual weather conditions, particularly during the planting and early growing season, can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of JohnDeere's customers, particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment. The timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production. Insufficientlevels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields. Excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting from occurring at optimal times,and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth. Temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields, and may also affect disease incidence. Temperatureaffects the rate of growth, crop maturity and crop 12 Table of Contentsquality.Natural calamities such as regional floods, hurricanes or other storms, and droughts can have significant negative effects on agricultural and livestock production. The resulting negativeimpact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment. Sales of turf equipment, particularly during the important spring selling season, can be dramatically impacted by weather.Adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment. Drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusuallyrainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes. Changes in the availability and price of certain raw materials, components and whole goods could result inproduction disruptions or increased costs and lower profits on sales of John Deere products.  John Deere requires access to various raw materials, components and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products. Changes inthe availability and price of these raw materials, components and whole goods, which have fluctuated significantly in the past and are more likely to fluctuate during times of economic volatility andregulatory instability, can significantly increase the costs of production which could have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business, particularly if John Deere, due to pricingconsiderations or other factors, is unable to recover the increased costs from its customers. John Deere relies on suppliers to acquire raw materials, components and whole goods required tomanufacture its products. Certain components and parts used in John Deere's products are available from a single supplier and cannot be re-sourced quickly. Supply chain disruptions due to supplierfinancial distress, capacity constraints, labor shortages, business continuity, quality, delivery or disruptions due to weather-related or natural disaster events could affect John Deere's operationsand profitability. John Deere's operations, suppliers and customers are subject to and affected by increasingly rigorousenvironmental, health and safety laws and regulations of federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and various regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over John Deere's internationaloperations. In addition, private civil litigation on these subjects has increased, primarily in the U.S.  Enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental, health and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigation and defense costs, and result insignificant fines or penalties. In addition, new or more stringent requirements ofgovernmental authorities could prevent or restrict John Deere's operations, or those of our suppliers and customers, require significant expenditures to achieve compliance and/or give rise to civil orcriminal liability. There can be no assurance that violations of such legislation and/or regulations, or private civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental,health or safety impacts of John Deere's operations, or those of our suppliers and customers, would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on John Deere's business, financialcondition or results of operations. Increasingly stringent engine emission regulations could impact John Deere's ability to manufacture anddistribute certain engines or equipment, which could negatively affect business results.  John Deere's equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction regulations throughout the world, including the European Union'sStage V standard. In addition, governmental agencies throughout the world are enacting more stringent laws and regulations to reduce off-road engine emissions. These laws and regulations areapplicable to engines manufactured by John Deere, including those used in John Deere agriculture and construction and forestry equipment. John Deere has incurred and continues to incur substantialresearch and development costs related to the implementation of these more rigorous laws and regulations. While John Deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirementsand does not currently foresee significant obstacles that would prevent timely compliance, these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect John Deere's ability tomanufacture and distribute certain equipment or engines, which could negatively impact business results. John Deere may incur increased costs due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards designedto address climate change and could be further impacted by physical effects attributed to climate change on its facilities, suppliers and customers.  There is a global political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) continue to alter the composition of Earth's atmosphere in waysthat are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate. These considerations may lead to international, national, regional or local legislative or regulatory responses in thefuture. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, including John Deere, areconsidering ways to reduce GHG emissions. The regulation of GHG emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources could result in additional costs to John Deere in the form of taxes or emissionallowances, facilities improvements and energy costs, which would increase John Deere's operating costs through higher utility, transportation and materials costs. Increased input costs, such as fueland fertilizer, and compliance-related costs could also impact customer operations and demand for John Deere equipment. Because the impact of any future GHG legislative, regulatory or product standardrequirements on John Deere's global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards, John Deere is unable to predict its potential impact at this time. Furthermore,the potential physical impacts of climate change on John Deere's facilities, suppliers and customers and therefore on John Deere's operations are highly uncertain and will be particularto the circumstances developing in various geographical regions. These may include long-term changes in temperature levels and water availability. These potential physical effects may adversely impactthe demand for John Deere's products and the cost, production, sales and financial performance of John Deere's operations. 13 Table of ContentsSecurity breaches and other disruptions to John Deere's information technology infrastructure could interferewith John Deere's operations and could compromise John Deere's and its customers' and suppliers' information, exposing John Deere to liability that would cause John Deere's business and reputation tosuffer.  In the ordinary course of business, John Deere relies upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, toprocess, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing andcollection of payments from dealers or other purchasers of John Deere equipment and from customers of John Deere's financial services operations. John Deere uses information technology systems torecord, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements.Additionally, John Deere collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of John Deere's customers andsuppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of John Deere's customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these informationtechnology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to John Deere's business operations and strategy. Despite security measures and business continuity plans, JohnDeere's information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance orother disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, terrorist acts or naturaldisasters or other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise John Deere's networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost orstolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personalinformation, disrupt operations, and damage John Deere's reputation, which could adversely affect John Deere's business. In addition, as security threats continue to evolve we may need to investadditional resources to protect the security of our systems. John Deere is subject to governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy anddata protection.  The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for theforeseeable future. John Deere collects personally identifiable information (PII) and other data as integral parts of its business processes and activities. This data is subject to a variety of U.S.and international laws and regulations, including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies. Many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union, Canada,and other relevant jurisdictions where we conduct business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of PII and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operatingwithin their jurisdiction that are more restrictive than those in the U.S. Additionally, in May 2016, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation that will impose more stringentdata protection requirements and will provide for greater penalties for noncompliance beginning in May 2018. Any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protectionconcerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations (including at newly acquired companies)could result in additional cost and liability to us or company officials, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and otherwise adversely affect our business. John Deere's ability to execute its strategy is dependent upon the ability to attract, train and retainqualified personnel.  John Deere's continued success depends, in part, on its ability to identify, attract, motivate, train and retain qualified personnel in key functions. Inparticular, John Deere is dependent on its ability to identify, attract, motivate, train and retain qualified personnel with the requisite education, background and industry experience. Failure toattract, train and retain qualified personnel, whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants, difficulty in recruiting new personnel, or the allocation of inadequate resourcesto training, integration and retention of qualified personnel, could impair John Deere's ability to execute itsbusiness strategy and could adversely affect John Deere's business. In addition, while John Deere strives to reduce the impact of the departure of employees, John Deere's operations or ability toexecute its business strategy may be impacted by the loss of personnel. Sustained increases in funding obligations under the Company's pension plans may impair the Company'sliquidity or financial condition.  The Company maintains certain defined benefit pension plans for certain employees, which impose funding obligations. The Company uses many assumptions incalculating its future payment obligations under the plans. Significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of returns on pension investments being lower thanexpected. The Company may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future. These factors could significantly increase the Company's payment obligations under the plansand adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. John Deere may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, joint ventures ordivestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected.  From time to time, the Company makes strategic acquisitions and divestituressuch as its acquisition of Wirtgenor participates injoint ventures. Transactions that the Company has entered into, or may enter into in the future, may involve significant challenges and risks, including that the transactions do not advance ourbusiness strategy, or fail to produce satisfactory returns on our investment. The Company may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with its operations, in applying internal controlprocesses to these acquisitions, in managing strategic investments, and in assimilating new capabilities to meet the future needs of the Company's business. Integrating acquisitions is often costlyand may require significant attention from management. Furthermore, John Deere may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of these transactions, or the realized benefits may be significantlydelayed. While our 14 Table of Contentsevaluationof any potential transaction includes business, legal, and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved, our due diligence reviews may notidentify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential risks of a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisitiontarget's previous activities or costs associated with any quality issues with an acquisition target's products or services. The reallocation of radio frequency (RF) spectrums could disrupt or degrade the reliability of John Deere'shigh precision augmented Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, which could impair John Deere's ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions as well as significantly reduceagricultural and construction customers' profitability.  John Deere's current and planned integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems, as well as its fleet management telematics solutions forconstruction equipment, depend upon the use of RF signals. These signals include, but are not limited to, GPS signals, other GPS-like satellite signals, augmented GPS services andother RF equipment which linkequipment, operations, owners, dealers and technicians. These radio services depend on frequency allocations governed by international and national agencies. Any international or national reallocationof frequency bands, including frequency bands segmentation and band spectrum sharing, or other modifications concerning the regulation of frequency bands, could significantly disrupt or degrade theutility and reliability of John Deere's GPS-based products, which could negatively affect John Deere's ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions. For John Deere'sagricultural customers, the inability to use high-precision augmented GPS signals or other RF signals could result in lower crop yields and higher equipment maintenance, seed, fertilizer, fueland wage costs. For construction customers, disrupting GPS or RF applications could result in higher fuel and equipment maintenance costs, as well as lower construction design and projectmanagement efficiencies. These cost increases could significantly reduce customers' profitability and demand for John Deere products"
4,DE,DEERE & CO,2016-12-19,"ITEM 1A.                  RISK FACTORS. The following risks are considered the most significant to John Deeres business based upon current knowledge, information and assumptions. This discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 22, including the risks and uncertainties described in the Safe Harbor Statement on pages 24 and 25, and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 37. These risk factors and other forward-looking statements that relate to future events, expectations, trends and operating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change, and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business, while others could affect all of the Companys businesses. Although each risk is discussed  10 separately, many are interrelated. The Company, except as required by law, undertakes no obligation to update or revise this risk factors discussion, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. The risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Safe Harbor Statement in this report are not the only risks faced by the Company. International, national and regional trade laws, regulations and policies (particularly those related to or restricting global trade) and government farm programs and policies could significantly impair John Deeres profitability and growth prospects. International, national and regional laws, regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting the import and export of John Deeres products, services and technology, including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors, could harm John Deeres multinational business and subject John Deere to civil and criminal sanctions. John Deeres profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace. Restricted access to global markets impairs John Deeres ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world, and limits the ability to access raw materials and high quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis. Trade restrictions could limit John Deeres ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair John Deeres ability to expand the business by offering new technologies, products and services. These restrictions may affect John Deeres competitive position. Additionally, John Deeres competitive position and results could be adversely affected by changes inor uncertainty surroundingU.S. trade policy. Furthermore, the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to John Deeres agricultural and forestry customers. Policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world. John Deeres agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world. Furthermore, trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living, which could negatively impact John Deeres future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food, fuel and infrastructure. Additionally, changes in government farm programs and policies, including direct payment and other subsidies, can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment. Furthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales or transactions to specific persons, including financial institutions, or countries or based on product classification expose John Deere to potential criminal and civil sanctions. Although John Deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of import and export laws and sanctions, these laws and sanctions, particularly with respect to eastern Europe, Cuba, and Iran, are changing rapidly. Violations of these laws could have an adverse effect on John Deeres reputation, business and results of operations and financial condition. Changes in government banking, monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on John Deere. Policies of the U.S. and other governments regarding banking, monetary and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity, stabilize financial markets and/or address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on John Deeres customers and markets. John Deeres operations and results could also be impacted by financial regulatory reform that could have an adverse effect on the financial services segment and on John Deeres customers by limiting their ability to enter into hedging transactions or to finance purchases of John Deere products. Government policies on taxes and spending can also affect John Deere, especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development. Changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of bio-energy could have an effect on the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain John Deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements. Changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the worlds growing food and bio-energy demands, driven in part by government policies and a growing world population, are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices, which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment. Lower farm commodity prices directly affect farm incomes, which could negatively affect sales of agricultural equipment. While higher commodity prices benefit John Deeres crop-producing agricultural equipment customers, higher commodity prices also could result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers. Furthermore, changing bio-fuel demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise, with corresponding changes in equipment demands. Finally, changes in governmental policies regulating bio-fuel utilization could affect demand for John Deeres diesel-fueled equipment and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards. 11 As John Deere seeks to expand its business globally, growth opportunities may be impacted by greater political, economic and social uncertainty and the continuing and accelerating globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of John Deeres competition, customer base and product offerings. John Deeres efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent upon access to additional geographic markets including, but not limited to, Brazil, China, India and Russia, and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in such markets. In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than John Deeres other markets. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes John Deere to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices, business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, property ownership rights, taxation, sanctions requirements, repatriation of earnings and advanced technologies. Expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the Companys financial results. As these emerging geographic markets become more important to John Deere, its competitors are also seeking to expand their production capacities and sales in these same markets. While John Deere maintains a positive corporate image and the John Deere brand is widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets, the brand is less well known in some emerging markets which could impede John Deeres efforts to successfully compete in these markets. Although John Deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances, John Deeres reputation and/or business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful. John Deere operates in highly competitive markets. John Deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets. John Deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. John Deere competes on the basis of product performance, innovation and quality, distribution, customer service and price. Aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing delays or John Deeres failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect John Deeres business, results of operations and financial condition. John Deeres business results depend largely on its ability to understand its customers specific preferences and requirements, and to develop, manufacture and market products that meet customer demand. John Deeres ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality, at affordable prices, is critical to its success. This requires a thorough understanding of John Deeres existing and potential customers on a global basis, particularly in potentially high-growth and emerging markets, including Brazil, China, India and Russia. Failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on John Deeres business. Negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for John Deeres equipment and services, limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs. The demand for John Deeres products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment, cautious consumer spending, lower corporate earnings, U.S. budget issues and lower business investment. Negative or uncertain economic conditions causing John Deeres customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their likelihood of purchasing John Deeres equipment. Sustained negative economic conditions and outlook affect housing starts and other construction which dampens demand for certain construction equipment. John Deeres turf operations and its construction and forestry business are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions. Decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on John Deeres results of operations. If negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy, there could be a similar effect on John Deeres agricultural equipment sales. In addition, uncertain or negative outlook with respect to ongoing U.S. budget issues as well as general economic conditions and outlook can cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions. Such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs, which could reduce the Companys earnings and cash flows. Additionally, the Companys investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets, which would negatively affect earnings. In addition, demand for John Deeres products and services can be significantly reduced by concerns regarding the diverse economic and political circumstances of the individual countries in the eurozone, the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, uncertainty related to the potential withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, and the long term stability of the euro as a single common currency. Persistent disparity with respect to the widely varying economic conditions within the individual countries in the eurozone, and its implications for the euro as well as market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Companys euro-denominated assets and obligations, have an adverse effect on demand for John Deeres products and services in the eurozone and have an adverse effect on financial markets in Europe and globally. More specifically, it could affect the ability of John Deeres customers, suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses, to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs, if at all, and the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for John Deeres products. 12 The Companys consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries, creating currency exchange and translation risk. John Deere operates in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. John Deere is subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that its costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which John Deere earns revenues. Additionally, the reporting currency for the Companys consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of John Deeres assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries currencies. Those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the Companys consolidated financial statements. Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements, even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency. Substantial fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar could have a significant impact on John Deeres results. Because the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deeres sales worldwide, John Deeres operations and financial results could be impacted materially should negative economic conditions affect the financial industry. In recent years, negative economic conditions have frequently had an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates. The financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deeres sales worldwide. The financial services segment is exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractual obligations. The financial services segment may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The financial services segments inability to access funds at cost-effective rates to support its financing activities could have a material adverse effect on John Deeres business. The financial services segments liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash flow requirements and to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities. Additionally, negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels, resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact the financial services segments write-offs and provision for credit losses. The financial services segment may also experience residual value losses that exceed its expectations caused by lower pricing for used equipment and higher than expected equipment returns at lease maturity. John Deeres equipment operations and financial services segments are subject to interest rate risks. Changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment, adversely affect interest margins and limit the ability to access capital markets while increasing borrowing costs. Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of John Deeres customers, either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for John Deere equipment and customers ability to repay obligations to John Deere. In addition, credit market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs which are very important to John Deeres financial services segment because such costs affect the segments ability to offer customers competitive financing rates. While the Company strives to match the interest rate characteristics of our financial assets and liabilities, changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the Companys net interest rate marginthe difference between the yield the Company earns on its assets and the interest rates the Company pays for funding, which could in turn affect the Companys net interest income and earnings. Actions by credit rating agencies, such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks, can affect the availability and cost of funding for the Company and can increase the Companys cost of capital and hurt its competitive position. The potential loss of John Deere intellectual property through trade secret theft, infringement of patents, trademark counterfeiting, or other loss of rights to exclusive use of John Deere intellectual property may have a material adverse effect on the Company. Our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others. John Deere relies on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secret laws, and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. In particular, we heavily rely on certain John Deere trademarks, which contribute to John Deeres identity and the recognition of its products and services, including but not limited to the John Deere mark, the leaping deer logo, the Nothing Runs Like a Deere slogan and the prefix JD associated with many products and the green and yellow equipment colors. These trademarks, as well as the many patents used in our products, are integral to the John Deere business, and their loss could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Additionally, third parties may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents or allege that we infringe their patents. We may incur substantial costs if our competitors or other third parties initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents or allege that we infringe their patents, or if we initiate any proceedings to protect our proprietary rights. If the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to us, our business could be adversely affected. We also cannot be certain that our products or technologies have not infringed or will not infringe the proprietary rights of others. Any such infringement could cause third parties, including our competitors, to bring claims against us, resulting in significant costs, possible damages and substantial uncertainty. 13 John Deere is subject to extensive anti-corruption laws and regulations. John Deeres global operations must comply with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act. These anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Although John Deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws, violations of these laws could result in criminal or civil sanctions and have an adverse effect on John Deeres reputation, business and results of operations and financial condition. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Act) and the regulations implementing the Act impose additional supervisory, financial and reporting requirements and compliance costs on John Deere and John Deeres financial services operations and could therefore adversely affect John Deere and its financial services segment. The Act was enacted on July 21, 2010 to broadly reform practices in the financial services industry, including equipment financing and securitizations. The Act directs federal agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and others, to adopt rules to regulate depository institutions, systemically important financial institutions, holding companies, the consumer finance industry and the capital markets, including certain commercial transactions such as derivatives contracts. Although the effects of the Act on the capital markets and the financial industry will not be fully known until all the regulations have been finalized and implemented, the Act and its regulations impose, or may impose, additional reporting, stress testing, leverage, liquidity, and capital requirements; and other supervisory and financial standards and restrictions that increase regulatory compliance costs for John Deere and John Deeres financial services operations and could adversely affect John Deere and its financial services segments funding activities, liquidity, structure (including relationships with affiliates), operations and performance. Moreover, John Deeres operations, including those outside of the United States, will also be impacted by non-U.S. regulatory reforms, including Basel III, being implemented to further regulate non-U.S. financial institutions and markets. John Deeres business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment. Poor or unusual weather conditions, particularly during the planting and early growing season, can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of John Deeres customers, particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment. The timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production. Insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields. Excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting from occurring at optimal times, and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth. Temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields, and may also affect disease incidence. Temperature affects the rate of growth, crop maturity and crop quality. Natural calamities such as regional floods, hurricanes or other storms, and droughts can have significant negative effects on agricultural and livestock production. The resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment. Sales of turf equipment, particularly during the important spring selling season, can be dramatically impacted by weather. Adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment. Drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes. Changes in the availability and price of certain raw materials, components and whole goods could result in production disruptions or increased costs and lower profits on sales of John Deere products. John Deere requires access to various raw materials, components and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products. Changes in the availability and price of these raw materials, components and whole goods, which have fluctuated significantly in the past and are more likely to fluctuate during times of economic volatility, can significantly increase the costs of production which could have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business, particularly if John Deere, due to pricing considerations or other factors, is unable to recover the increased costs from its customers. John Deere relies on suppliers to acquire raw materials, components and whole goods required to manufacture its products. Certain components and parts used in John Deeres products are available from a single supplier and cannot be re-sourced quickly. Supply chain disruptions due to supplier financial distress, capacity constraints, business continuity, quality, delivery or disruptions due to weather-related or natural disaster events could affect John Deeres operations and profitability. 14 John Deeres operations, suppliers and customers are subject to and affected by increasingly rigorous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations of federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and various regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over John Deeres international operations. In addition, private civil litigation on these subjects has increased, primarily in the U.S. Enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental, health and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigation and defense costs, and result in significant fines or penalties. In addition, new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities could prevent or restrict John Deeres operations, or those of our suppliers and customers, require significant expenditures to achieve compliance and/or give rise to civil or criminal liability. There can be no assurance that violations of such legislation and/or regulations, or private civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental, health or safety impacts of John Deeres operations, or those of our suppliers and customers, would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on John Deeres business, financial condition or results of operations. Increasingly stringent engine emission standards could impact John Deeres ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment, which could negatively affect business results. John Deeres equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction standards, including Final Tier 4 non-road diesel emission requirements in the U.S. and the European Unions Stage IV standard and recently enacted Stage V standard. In addition, governmental agencies throughout the world are enacting more stringent laws and regulations to reduce off-road engine emissions. These standards are applicable to many engines manufactured by John Deere and used in many models of John Deere agriculture and construction and forestry equipment. John Deere has incurred and continues to incur substantial research and development costs and is introducing many new equipment models, largely due to the implementation of these more rigorous standards. While John Deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements and does not currently foresee significant obstacles that would prevent timely compliance, these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect John Deeres ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or engines, which could negatively impact business results. John Deere may incur increased costs due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards designed to address climate change and could be further impacted by physical effects attributed to climate change on its facilities, suppliers and customers. There is a political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) continue to alter the composition of Earths atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate. These considerations may lead to international, national, regional or local legislative or regulatory responses in the future. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, including John Deere, are considering ways to reduce GHG emissions. The regulation of GHG emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources could result in additional costs to John Deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances, facilities improvements and energy costs, which would increase John Deeres operating costs through higher utility, transportation and materials costs. Increased input costs, such as fuel and fertilizer, and compliance-related costs could also impact customer operations and demand for John Deere equipment. Because the impact of any future GHG legislative, regulatory or product standard requirements on John Deeres global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards, John Deere is unable to predict its potential impact at this time. Furthermore, the potential physical impacts of climate change on John Deeres facilities, suppliers and customers and therefore on John Deeres operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions. These may include long-term changes in temperature levels and water availability. These potential physical effects may adversely impact the demand for John Deeres products and the cost, production, sales and financial performance of John Deeres operations. Security breaches and other disruptions to John Deeres information technology infrastructure could interfere with John Deeres operations and could compromise John Deeres and its customers and suppliers information, exposing John Deere to liability that would cause John Deeres business and reputation to suffer. In the ordinary course of business, John Deere relies upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments from dealers or other purchasers of John Deere equipment and from customers of John Deeres financial services operations. John Deere uses information technology systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Additionally, John Deere collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of John Deeres customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of John Deeres customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this  15 information is critical to John Deeres business operations and strategy. Despite security measures and business continuity plans, John Deeres information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, terrorist acts or natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise John Deeres networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations, and damage John Deeres reputation, which could adversely affect John Deeres business. In addition, as security threats continue to evolve we may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of our systems. John Deere is subject to governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection. The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. John Deere collects personally identifiable information (PII) and other data as an integral part of its business processes and activities. This data is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies. Many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union, Canada, and other relevant jurisdictions where we conduct business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of PII and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdiction that are more restrictive than those in the U.S. Additionally, in May 2016, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation that will impose more stringent data protection requirements and will provide for greater penalties for noncompliance beginning in May 2018. Any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations could result in additional cost and liability to us or company officials, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and otherwise adversely affect our business. John Deeres ability to execute its strategy is dependent upon the ability to attract, train and retain qualified personnel. John Deeres continued success depends, in part, on its ability to identify, attract, motivate, train and retain qualified personnel in key functions. In particular, John Deere is dependent on its ability to identify, attract, motivate, train and retain qualified personnel with the requisite education, background and industry experience. Failure to attract, train and retain qualified personnel, whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants, difficulty in recruiting new personnel, or the allocation of inadequate resources to training, integration and retention of qualified personnel, could impair John Deeres ability to execute its business strategy and could adversely affect John Deeres business. In addition, while John Deere strives to reduce the impact of the departure of its employees, John Deeres operations or ability to execute its business strategy may be impacted by the loss of personnel. Sustained increases in funding obligations under the Companys pension plans may impair the Companys liquidity or financial condition. The Company maintains certain defined benefit pension plans for certain employees, which impose funding obligations. The Company uses many assumptions in calculating its future payment obligations under the plans. Significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of returns on pension investments being lower than expected. The Company may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future. These factors could significantly increase the Companys payment obligations under the plans and adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. The reallocation of radio frequency (RF) spectrums could disrupt or degrade the reliability of John Deeres high precision augmented Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, which could impair John Deeres ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions as well as significantly reduce agricultural and construction customers profitability. John Deeres current and planned integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems, as well as its fleet management telematics solutions for construction equipment, depend upon the use of RF signals. These signals include, but are not limited to, GPS signals, other GPS-like satellite signals, augmented GPS services and other RF equipment which link equipment, operations, owners, dealers and technicians. These radio services depend on frequency allocations governed by international and national agencies. Any international or national reallocation of frequency bands, including frequency bands segmentation and band spectrum sharing, or other modifications concerning the regulation of frequency bands, could significantly disrupt or degrade the utility and reliability of John Deeres GPS-based products, which could negatively affect John Deeres ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions. For John Deeres agricultural customers, the inability to use high-precision augmented GPS signals or other RF signals could result in lower crop yields and higher equipment maintenance, seed, fertilizer, fuel and wage costs. For construction customers, disrupting GPS or RF applications could result in higher fuel and equipment maintenance costs, as well as lower construction design and project management efficiencies. These cost increases could significantly reduce customers profitability and demand for John Deere products. 16 "
13,DE,DEERE & CO,2015-12-18,"ITEM 1A.                  RISK FACTORS. The following risks are considered the most significant to John Deeres business based upon current knowledge, information and assumptions. This discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 21, including the risks and uncertainties described in the Safe Harbor Statement on pages 23 through 24, and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 37. These risk factors and other forward-looking statements that relate to future events, expectations, trends and operating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change, and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business, while others could affect all of the Companys businesses. Although each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. The Company, except as required by law, undertakes no obligation to update or revise this risk factors discussion, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. The risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Safe Harbor Statement in this report are not the only risks faced by the Company. 10 International, national and regional trade laws, regulations and policies (particularly those related to or restricting global trade) and government farm programs and policies could significantly impair John Deeres profitability and growth prospects. International, national and regional laws, regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting the import and export of John Deeres products, services and technology, including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors, could harm John Deeres multinational business and subject John Deere to civil and criminal sanctions. John Deeres profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace. Restricted access to global markets impairs John Deeres ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world, and limits the ability to access raw materials and high quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis. Trade restrictions could limit John Deeres ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair John Deeres ability to expand the business by offering new technologies, products and services. These restrictions may affect John Deeres competitive position. Furthermore, the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to John Deeres agricultural and forestry customers. Policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world. John Deeres agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world. Furthermore, trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living, which could negatively impact John Deeres future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food, fuel and infrastructure. Additionally, changes in government farm programs and policies, including direct payment and other subsidies, can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment. Furthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the US and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales or transactions to specific persons, including financial institutions, or countries or based on product classification expose John Deere to potential criminal and civil sanctions. Although John Deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of import and export laws and sanctions, these laws and sanctions, particularly with respect to eastern Europe, are changing rapidly. Violations of these laws could have an adverse effect on John Deeres reputation, business and results of operations and financial condition. Changes in government banking, monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on John Deere. Policies of the U.S. and other governments regarding banking, monetary and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity, stabilize financial markets and/or address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on John Deeres customers and markets. John Deeres operations and results could also be impacted by financial regulatory reform that could have an adverse effect on the financial services segment and on John Deeres customers by limiting their ability to enter into hedging transactions or to finance purchases of John Deere products. Government policies on taxes and spending can also affect John Deere, especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development. Changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of bio-energy could have an effect on the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain John Deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements. Changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the worlds growing food and bio-energy demands, driven in part by government policies and a growing world population, are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices, which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment. Lower farm commodity prices directly affect farm incomes, which could negatively affect sales of agricultural equipment. While higher commodity prices benefit John Deeres crop-producing agricultural equipment customers, higher commodity prices also could result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers. Furthermore, changing bio-fuel demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise, with corresponding changes in equipment demands. Finally, changes in governmental policies regulating bio-fuel utilization could affect demand for John Deeres diesel-fueled equipment and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards. As John Deere seeks to expand its business globally, growth opportunities may be impacted by greater political, economic and social uncertainty and the continuing and accelerating globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of John Deeres competition, customer base and product offerings. John Deeres efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent upon access to and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in additional geographic markets including but not limited to Brazil, China, India and Russia. In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than John Deeres other markets. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes John Deere to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural 11 practices, business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, property ownership rights, taxation, sanctions requirements and repatriation of earnings and advanced technologies. Expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the Companys financial results. As these emerging geographic markets become more important to John Deere, its competitors are also seeking to expand their production capacities and sales in these same markets. While John Deere maintains a positive corporate image and the John Deere brand is widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets, the brand is less well known in some emerging markets which could impede John Deeres efforts to successfully compete in these markets. Although John Deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances, John Deeres reputation and/or business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful. John Deere operates in highly competitive markets. John Deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets. John Deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. John Deere competes on the basis of product performance, innovation and quality, distribution, customer service and price. Aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing delays or John Deeres failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect John Deeres business, results of operations and financial condition. John Deere is subject to extensive anti-corruption laws and regulations. John Deeres global operations must comply with all applicable laws, which may include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act or other anti-corruption laws. These anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Although John Deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws, violations of these laws could result in criminal or civil sanctions and have an adverse effect on John Deeres reputation, business and results of operations and financial condition. Negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for John Deeres equipment and services, limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs. The demand for John Deeres products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment, cautious consumer spending, lower corporate earnings, U.S. budget issues and lower business investment. Negative or uncertain economic conditions causing John Deeres customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their likelihood of purchasing John Deeres equipment. Sustained negative economic conditions and outlook affect housing starts and other construction which dampens demand for certain construction equipment. John Deeres turf operations and its construction and forestry business are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions. Decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on John Deeres results of operations. If negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy, there could be a similar effect on John Deeres agricultural equipment sales. In addition, uncertain or negative outlook with respect to ongoing U.S. budget issues as well as general economic conditions and outlook can cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions. Such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs, which could reduce the Companys earnings and cash flows. Additionally, the Companys investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets, which would negatively affect earnings. In addition, demand for John Deeres products and services can be significantly reduced by concerns regarding the diverse economic and political circumstances of the individual countries in the eurozone, the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, and the long term stability of the euro as a single common currency. Persistent disparity with respect to the widely varying economic conditions within the individual countries in the eurozone, and its implications for the euro as well as market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Companys euro- denominated assets and obligations, have an adverse effect on demand for John Deeres products and services in the eurozone and have an adverse effect on financial markets in Europe and globally. More specifically, it could affect the ability of John Deeres customers, suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses, to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs, if at all, the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for John Deeres products. 12 The Companys consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries, creating currency translation risk. John Deere operates in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. John Deere is subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that its costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which John Deere earns revenues. Additionally, the reporting currency for the Companys consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of John Deeres assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries currencies. Those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the Companys consolidated financial statements. Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements, even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency. Substantial fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar could have a significant impact on John Deeres results. Because the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deeres sales worldwide, John Deeres operations and financial results could be impacted materially should negative economic conditions affect the financial industry. In recent years, negative economic conditions have frequently had an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates. The financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deeres sales worldwide. The financial services segment is exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractual obligations. The financial services segment may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The financial services segments inability to access funds at cost-effective rates to support its financing activities could have a material adverse effect on John Deeres business. The financial services segments liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash flow requirements and to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities. Additionally, negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels, resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact the financial services segments write-offs and provision for credit losses. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Act) and the regulations implementing the Act impose additional supervisory, financial and reporting requirements and compliance costs on John Deere and John Deeres financial services operations and could therefore adversely affect John Deere and its financial services segment. The Act was enacted on July 21, 2010 to broadly reform practices in the financial services industry, including equipment financing and securitizations. The Act directs federal agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and others, to adopt rules to regulate depository institutions, non-bank financial institutions, thrift holding companies, the consumer finance industry and the capital markets, including certain commercial transactions such as derivatives contracts. Although the effects of the Act on the capital markets and the financial industry are not fully known until all the regulations have been finalized and implemented, the Act and its regulations impose additional reporting requirements, stress testing requirements, leverage, liquidity requirements, capital and other supervisory and financial standards and restrictions that increase regulatory-related compliance costs for John Deere and John Deeres financial services operations and could adversely affect John Deere and its financial services segments funding activities, liquidity, structure (including relationships with affiliates), operations and performance. Moreover, John Deeres operations, including those outside of the United States, will also be impacted by non-U.S. regulatory reforms, including Basel III, being implemented to further regulate non-U.S. financial institutions and markets. John Deeres business results depend largely on its ability to understand its customers specific preferences and requirements, and to develop, manufacture and market products that meet customer demand. John Deeres ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality, at affordable prices, is critical to its success. This requires a thorough understanding of John Deeres existing and potential customers on a global basis, particularly in potentially high-growth and emerging markets, including Brazil, China, India and Russia. Failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on John Deeres business. John Deeres business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment. Poor or unusual weather conditions, particularly during the planting and early growing season, can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of John Deeres customers, particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment. The timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production. Insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields. Excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting 13 from occurring at optimal times, and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth. Temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields, and may also affect disease incidence. Temperature affects the rate of growth, crop maturity and crop quality. Natural calamities such as regional floods, hurricanes or other storms, and droughts can have significant negative effects on agricultural and livestock production. The resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment. Sales of turf equipment, particularly during the important spring selling season, can be dramatically impacted by weather. Adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment. Drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes. Changes in the availability and price of certain raw materials, components and whole goods could result in production disruptions or increased costs and lower profits on sales of John Deere products. John Deere requires access to various raw materials, components and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products. Changes in the availability and price of these raw materials, components and whole goods, which have fluctuated significantly in the past and are more likely to fluctuate during times of economic volatility, can significantly increase the costs of production which could have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business, particularly if John Deere, due to pricing considerations or other factors, is unable to recover the increased costs from its customers. John Deere relies on suppliers to acquire raw materials, components and whole goods required to manufacture its products. Certain components and parts used in John Deeres products are available from a single supplier and cannot be re-sourced quickly. Supply chain disruptions due to supplier financial distress, capacity constraints, business continuity, quality, delivery or disruptions due to weather-related or natural disaster events could affect John Deeres operations and profitability. John Deeres equipment operations and financial services segment are subject to interest rate risks. Changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment, adversely affect interest margins and limit the ability to access capital markets while increasing borrowing costs. Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of John Deeres customers, either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for John Deere equipment and customers ability to repay obligations to John Deere. In addition, credit market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs which are very important to John Deeres financial services segment because such costs affect the segments ability to offer customers competitive financing rates. In addition, changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the Companys net interest rate marginthe difference between the yield the Company earns on its assets and the interest rates the Company pays for funding, which could in turn affect the Companys net interest income and earnings. Actions by credit rating agencies, such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks, can affect the availability and cost of funding for the Company and can increase the Companys cost of capital and hurt its competitive position. John Deeres operations, suppliers and customers are subject to and affected by increasingly rigorous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations of federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and various regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over John Deeres international operations. In addition, private civil litigation on these subjects has increased, primarily in the U.S. Enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental, health and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigation and defense costs, and result in significant fines or penalties. In addition, new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities could prevent or restrict John Deeres operations, or those of our suppliers and customers, require significant expenditures to achieve compliance and/or give rise to civil or criminal liability. There can be no assurance that violations of such legislation and/or regulations, or private civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental, health or safety impacts of John Deeres operations, or those of our suppliers and customers, would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on John Deeres business, financial condition or results of operations. Increasingly stringent engine emission standards could impact John Deeres ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment, which could negatively affect business results. John Deeres equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction standards, including Final Tier 4/Stage IV non-road diesel emission requirements in the U.S. and European Union. In addition, governmental agencies throughout the world are enacting more stringent laws and regulations to reduce off-road engine emissions. These standards are applicable to many engines manufactured by John Deere and used in many models of John Deere agriculture and construction and forestry equipment. John Deere has incurred and continues to incur substantial research and development costs and is introducing many new equipment models, largely due to the implementation of these more rigorous standards. While John Deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements and does not currently foresee significant obstacles that would 14 prevent timely compliance, these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect John Deeres ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or engines, which could negatively impact business results. Security breaches and other disruptions to John Deeres information technology infrastructure could interfere with John Deeres operations and could compromise John Deeres and its customers and suppliers information, exposing John Deere to liability that would cause John Deeres business and reputation to suffer. In the ordinary course of business, John Deere relies upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments from dealers or other purchasers of John Deere equipment and from customers of John Deeres financial services operations. John Deere uses information technology systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Additionally, John Deere collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of John Deeres customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of John Deeres customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to John Deeres business operations and strategy. Despite security measures and business continuity plans, John Deeres information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, terrorist acts or natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise John Deeres networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations, and damage John Deeres reputation, which could adversely affect John Deeres business. In addition, as security threats continue to evolve we may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of our systems. John Deere may incur increased costs due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards designed to address climate change and could be further impacted by physical effects attributed to climate change on its facilities, suppliers and customers. There is a growing political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) continue to alter the composition of Earths atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate. These considerations may lead to international, national, regional or local legislative or regulatory responses in the future. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, including John Deere, are considering ways to reduce GHG emissions. The regulation of GHG emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources could result in additional costs to John Deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances, facilities improvements and energy costs, which would increase John Deeres operating costs through higher utility, transportation and materials costs. Increased input costs, such as fuel and fertilizer, and compliance-related costs could also impact customer operations and demand for John Deere equipment. Because the impact of any future GHG legislative, regulatory or product standard requirements on John Deeres global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards, John Deere is unable to predict its potential impact at this time. Furthermore, the potential physical impacts of climate change on John Deeres facilities, suppliers and customers and therefore on John Deeres operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions. These may include long-term changes in temperature levels and water availability. These potential physical effects may adversely impact the demand for John Deeres products and the cost, production, sales and financial performance of John Deeres operations. Sustained increases in funding obligations under the Companys pension plans may impair the Companys liquidity or financial condition. The Company maintains certain defined benefit pension plans for certain employees, which impose on us funding obligations. The Company uses many assumptions in calculating its future payment obligations under the plans. Significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of returns on pension investments being lower than expected. The Company may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future. These factors could significantly increase the Companys payment obligations under the plans and adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. 15 The reallocation of radio frequency (RF) spectrums could disrupt or degrade the reliability of John Deeres high precision augmented Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, which could impair John Deeres ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions as well as significantly reduce agricultural and construction customers profitability. John Deeres current and planned integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems, as well as its fleet management telematics solutions for construction equipment, depend upon the use of RF signals. These signals include, but are not limited to, GPS signals, other GPS-like satellite signals, augmented GPS services and other RF equipment which link equipment, operations, owners, dealers and technicians. These radio services depend on frequency allocations governed by international and national agencies. Any international or national reallocation of frequency bands, including frequency bands segmentation and band spectrum sharing, or other modifications concerning the regulation of frequency bands, could significantly disrupt or degrade the utility and reliability of John Deeres GPS-based products, which could negatively affect John Deeres ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions. For John Deeres agricultural customers, the inability to use high-precision augmented GPS signals or other RF signals could result in lower crop yields and higher equipment maintenance, seed, fertilizer, fuel and wage costs. For construction customers, disrupting GPS or RF applications could result in higher fuel and equipment maintenance costs, as well as lower construction design and project management efficiencies. These cost increases could significantly reduce customers profitability and demand for John Deere products. "
11,DE,DEERE & CO,2014-12-19,"ITEM 1A.              RISK FACTORS. The following risks are considered the most significant to John Deeres business based upon current knowledge, information and assumptions. This discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 21, including the risks and uncertainties described in the Safe Harbor Statement on pages 23 through 24, and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 36. These risk factors and other forward-looking statements that relate to future events, expectations, trends and operating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change, and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business, while others could affect all of the Companys businesses. Although each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. The Company, except as required by law, undertakes no obligation to update or revise this risk factors discussion, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. The risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Safe Harbor Statement in this report are not the only risks faced by the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties may also materially affect the Companys business, financial condition or operating results. You should not consider these risk factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions. International, national and regional trade laws, regulations and policies (particularly those related to or restricting global trade) and government farm programs and policies could significantly impair John Deeres profitability and growth prospects. International, national and regional laws, regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting the import and export of John Deeres products, services and technology, including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors, could harm John Deeres multinational business and subject John Deere to civil and criminal sanctions. John Deeres profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace. Restricted access to global markets impairs John Deeres ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world, and limits the ability to access raw materials and high quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis. Trade restrictions could limit John Deeres ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair John Deeres ability to expand the business by offering new technologies, products and services. These restrictions may affect John Deeres competitive position. Furthermore, the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to John Deeres agricultural and forestry customers. Policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world. John Deeres agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world. Furthermore, trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living, which could negatively impact John Deeres future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food, fuel and infrastructure. Additionally, changes in government farm programs and policies, including direct payment and other subsidies, can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment. Furthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the US and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales or transactions to specific persons, including financial institutions, or countries or based on product classification expose John Deere to potential criminal and civil sanctions. Although John Deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of import and export laws and sanctions, these laws and sanctions, particularly with respect to eastern Europe, are changing rapidly. Violations of these laws could have an adverse effect on John Deeres reputation, business and results of operations and financial condition. Changes in government banking, monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on John Deere. Policies of the U.S. and other governments regarding banking, monetary and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity, stabilize financial markets and/or address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on John Deeres customers and markets. John Deeres operations and results could also be impacted by financial regulatory reform that could have an adverse effect on the financial services segment and on John Deeres customers by limiting their ability to enter into hedging transactions or to finance purchases of John Deere products. Government policies on taxes and spending can also affect John Deere, especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development. Changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of bio-energy could have an effect on the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain John Deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements. Changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the worlds growing food and bio-energy demands, driven in part by government policies and a growing world population, are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices, which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment. While higher commodity prices benefit John Deeres crop-producing agricultural equipment customers, higher commodity prices also could result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers. Furthermore, changing bio-fuel demands may cause farmers to change the  11Table of Contents types or quantities of the crops they raise, with corresponding changes in equipment demands. Finally, changes in governmental policies regulating bio-fuel utilization could affect demand for John Deeres gasoline- or diesel-fueled equipment and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards. As John Deere seeks to expand its business globally, growth opportunities may be impacted by greater political, economic and social uncertainty and the continuing and accelerating globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of John Deeres competition, customer base and product offerings. John Deeres efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent upon access to and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in additional geographic markets including but not limited to Brazil, China, India and Russia. In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than John Deeres other markets. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes John Deere to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices, business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, property ownership rights, taxation, sanctions requirements and repatriation of earnings and advanced technologies. Expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the Companys financial results. As these emerging geographic markets become more important to John Deere, its competitors are also seeking to expand their production capacities and sales in these same markets. While John Deere maintains a positive corporate image and the John Deere brand is widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets, the brand is less well known in some emerging markets which could impede John Deeres efforts to successfully compete in these markets. Although John Deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances, John Deeres reputation and/or business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful. John Deere operates in highly competitive markets. John Deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets. John Deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. John Deere competes on the basis of product performance, innovation and quality, distribution, customer service and price. Aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing delays or John Deeres failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect John Deeres business, results of operations and financial condition. John Deere is subject to extensive anti-corruption laws and regulations. John Deeres global operations must comply with all applicable laws, which may include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act or other anti-corruption laws. These anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Although John Deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws, violations of these laws could result in criminal or civil sanctions and have an adverse effect on John Deeres reputation, business and results of operations and financial condition. Negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for John Deeres equipment and services, limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs. The demand for John Deeres products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment, cautious consumer spending, lower corporate earnings, U.S. budget issues and lower business investment. Negative or uncertain economic conditions causing John Deeres customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their likelihood of purchasing John Deeres equipment. Sustained negative economic conditions and outlook affect housing starts and other construction which dampens demand for certain construction equipment. John Deeres turf operations and its construction and forestry business are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions. Failure of increases in construction activity and housing starts to continue and be sustained could have a material adverse effect on John Deeres results of operations. If negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy, there could be a similar effect on John Deeres agricultural equipment sales. In addition, uncertain or negative outlook with respect to ongoing U.S. budget issues as well as general economic conditions and outlook can cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions. Such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs, which could reduce the Companys earnings and cash flows. Additionally, the Companys investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets, which would negatively affect earnings. 12Table of Contents In addition, demand for John Deeres products and services can be significantly reduced by concerns regarding the diverse economic and political circumstances of the individual countries in the eurozone, the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, and the long term stability of the euro as a single common currency. Persistent disparity with respect to the widely varying economic conditions within the individual countries in the eurozone, and its implications for the euro as well as market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Companys euro- denominated assets and obligations, have an adverse effect on demand for John Deeres products and services in the eurozone and have an adverse effect on financial markets in Europe and globally. More specifically, it could affect the ability of John Deeres customers, suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses, to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs, if at all, the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for John Deeres products. The Companys consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries, creating currency translation risk. John Deere operates in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. John Deere is subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that its costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which John Deere earns revenues. Additionally, the reporting currency for the Companys consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of John Deeres assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries currencies. Those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the Companys consolidated financial statements. Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements, even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency. Substantial fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar could have a significant impact on John Deeres results. Because the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deeres sales worldwide, John Deeres operations and financial results could be impacted materially should negative economic conditions affect the financial industry. In recent years, negative economic conditions have frequently had an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates. The financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deeres sales worldwide. The financial services segment is exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractual obligations. The financial services segment may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The financial services segments inability to access funds at cost-effective rates to support its financing activities could have a material adverse effect on John Deeres business. The financial services segments liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash flow requirements and to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities. Additionally, negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels, resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact the financial services segments write-offs and provision for credit losses. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Act) and the regulations implementing the Act impose additional supervisory, financial and reporting requirements and compliance costs on John Deere and John Deeres financial services operations and could therefore adversely affect John Deere and its financial services segment. The Act was enacted on July 21, 2010 to broadly reform practices in the financial services industry, including equipment financing and securitizations.

Natural calamities such as regional floods, hurricanes or other storms, and droughts can have significant negative effects on agricultural and livestock production. The resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment. In addition, poor or unusual weather conditions at critical periods in the planting, growing or harvesting seasons can impact the profitability of crop risk mitigation products. Sales of turf equipment, particularly during the important spring selling season, can be dramatically impacted by weather. Adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment. Drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes. Changes in the availability and price of certain raw materials, components and whole goods could result in production disruptions or increased costs and lower profits on sales of John Deere products. John Deere requires access to various raw materials, components and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products.

Actions by credit rating agencies, such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks, can affect the availability and cost of funding for the Company and can increase the Companys cost of capital and hurt its competitive position. John Deeres operations, suppliers and customers are subject to and affected by increasingly rigorous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations of federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and various regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over John Deeres international operations. In addition, private civil litigation on these subjects has increased, primarily in the U.S. Enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental, health and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigation and defense costs, and result in significant fines or penalties. In addition, new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities could prevent or restrict John Deeres operations, or those of our suppliers and customers, require significant expenditures to achieve compliance and/or give rise to civil or criminal liability. There can be no assurance that violations of such legislation and/or regulations, or private civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental, health or safety impacts of John Deeres operations, or those of our suppliers and customers, would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on John Deeres business, financial condition or results of operations. 14Table of Contents Increasingly stringent engine emission standards could impact John Deeres ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment, which could negatively affect business results. John Deeres equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction standards, including USEPA, Interim Tier 4/Stage IIIb and Final Tier 4/Stage IV non-road diesel emission requirements in the U.S. and European Union. These standards are applicable to many engines manufactured by John Deere and used in many models of John Deere agriculture and construction and forestry equipment. John Deere has incurred and continues to incur substantial research and development costs and is introducing many new equipment models, largely due to the implementation of these more rigorous standards. While John Deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements and does not currently foresee significant obstacles that would prevent timely compliance, these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect John Deeres ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or engines, which could negatively impact business results. Security breaches and other disruptions to John Deeres information technology infrastructure could interfere with John Deeres operations and could compromise John Deeres and its customers and suppliers information, exposing John Deere to liability that would cause John Deeres business and reputation to suffer. In the ordinary course of business, John Deere relies upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments from dealers or other purchasers of John Deere equipment and from customers of John Deeres financial services operations. John Deere uses information technology systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Additionally, John Deere collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of John Deeres customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of John Deeres customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to John Deeres business operations and strategy. Despite security measures and business continuity plans, John Deeres information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise John Deeres networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations, and damage John Deeres reputation, which could adversely affect John Deeres business. John Deere may incur increased costs due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards designed to address climate change and could be further impacted by physical effects attributed to climate change on its facilities, suppliers and customers. There is a growing political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) continue to alter the composition of Earths atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate. These considerations may lead to international, national, regional or local legislative or regulatory responses in the future. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, including John Deere, are considering ways to reduce GHG emissions. The regulation of GHG emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources could result in additional costs to John Deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances, facilities improvements and energy costs, which would increase John Deeres operating costs through higher utility, transportation and materials costs. Increased input costs, such as fuel and fertilizer, and compliance-related costs could also impact customer operations and demand for John Deere equipment. Because the impact of any future GHG legislative, regulatory or product standard requirements on John Deeres global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards, John Deere is unable to predict its potential impact at this time. Furthermore, the potential physical impacts of climate change on John Deeres facilities, suppliers and customers and therefore on John Deeres operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions. These may include long-term changes in temperature levels and water availability. These potential physical effects may adversely impact the demand for John Deeres products and the cost, production, sales and financial performance of John Deeres operations. Sustained increases in funding obligations under the Companys pension plans may impair the Companys liquidity or financial condition. The Company maintains certain defined benefit pension plans for certain employees, which impose on us funding obligations. The  15Table of Contents Company uses many assumptions in calculating its future payment obligations under the plans. Significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of returns on pension investments being lower than expected. The Company may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future. These factors could significantly increase the Companys payment obligations under the plans and adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. The reallocation of radio frequency (RF) spectrums could disrupt or degrade the reliability of John Deeres high precision augmented Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, which could impair John Deeres ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions as well as significantly reduce agricultural and construction customers profitability. John Deeres current and planned integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems, as well as its fleet management telematics solutions for construction equipment, depend upon the use of RF signals. These signals include, but are not limited to, GPS signals, other GPS-like satellite signals, augmented GPS services and other RF equipment which link equipment, operations, owners, dealers and technicians. These radio services depend on frequency allocations governed by international and national agencies. Any international or national reallocation of frequency bands, including frequency bands segmentation and band spectrum sharing, or other modifications concerning the regulation of frequency bands, could significantly disrupt or degrade the utility and reliability of John Deeres GPS-based products, which could negatively affect John Deeres ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions. For John Deeres agricultural customers, the inability to use high-precision augmented GPS signals or other RF signals could result in lower crop yields and higher equipment maintenance, seed, fertilizer, fuel and wage costs. For construction customers, disrupting GPS or RF applications could result in higher fuel and equipment maintenance costs, as well as lower construction design and project management efficiencies. These cost increases could significantly reduce customers profitability and demand for John Deere products. "
14,DE,DEERE & CO,2013-12-16,"ITEM 1A.                                         RISK FACTORS. The following risks are considered the most significant to John Deeres business based upon current knowledge, information and assumptions. This discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 23, including the risks and uncertainties described in the Safe Harbor Statement on pages 25 through 27, and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 39. These risk factors and other forward-looking statements that relate to future events, expectations, trends and operating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change, and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business, while others could affect all of the Companys businesses. Although each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. The Company, except as required by law, undertakes no obligation to update or revise this risk factors discussion, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. The risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Safe Harbor Statement in this report are not the only risks faced by the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties may also materially affect the Companys business, financial condition or operating results. You should not consider these risk factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions. International, national and regional trade laws, regulations and policies (particularly those related to or restricting global trade) and government farm programs and policies could significantly impair John Deeres profitability and growth prospects. International, national and regional laws, regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting the import and export of John Deeres products, services and technology, including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors, could harm John Deeres multinational business and subject John Deere to civil and criminal sanctions. John Deeres profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace. Restricted access to global markets impairs John Deeres ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world, and limits the ability to access 11Table of Contents raw materials and high quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis. Trade restrictions could limit John Deeres ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair John Deeres ability to expand the business by offering new technologies, products and services. These restrictions may affect John Deeres competitive position. Furthermore, the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to John Deeres agricultural and forestry customers. Policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world. John Deeres agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world. Furthermore, trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living, which could negatively impact John Deeres future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food, fuel and infrastructure. Additionally, changes in government farm programs and policies, including direct payment and other subsidies, can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment. Furthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the US and other governments prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification expose John Deere to criminal and civil sanctions.  Although John Deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of import and export laws, violations of these laws could have an adverse effect on John Deeres reputation, business and results of operations and financial condition. Changes in government banking, monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on John Deere. Policies of the U.S. and other governments regarding banking, monetary and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity, stabilize financial markets and/or address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on John Deeres customers and markets. John Deeres operations and results could also be impacted by financial regulatory reform that could have an adverse effect on the financial services segment and on John Deeres customers by limiting their ability to enter into hedging transactions or to finance purchases of John Deere products. Government policies on taxes and spending can also affect John Deere, especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development. Changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of bio-energy could have an effect on the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain John Deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements. Changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the worlds growing food and bio-energy demands, driven in part by government policies and a growing world population, are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices, which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment. While higher commodity prices benefit John Deeres crop-producing agricultural equipment customers, higher commodity prices also could result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers. Furthermore, changing bio-fuel demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise, with corresponding changes in equipment demands. Finally, changes in governmental policies regulating bio-fuel utilization could affect demand for John Deeres gasoline- or diesel-fueled equipment and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards. As John Deere seeks to expand its business globally, growth opportunities may be impacted by greater political, economic and social uncertainty and the continuing and accelerating globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of John Deeres competition, customer base and product offerings. John Deeres efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent upon access to and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in additional geographic markets including but not limited to Brazil, China, India and Russia. In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than John Deeres other markets. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes John Deere to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices, business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, property ownership rights, taxation and repatriation of earnings and advanced technologies. Expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the Companys financial results. As these emerging geographic markets become more important to John Deere, its competitors are also seeking to expand their production capacities and sales in these same markets. While John Deere maintains a positive corporate image and the John Deere brand is widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets, the brand is less well known in some emerging markets which could impede John 12Table of Contents Deeres efforts to successfully compete in these markets. Although John Deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances, John Deeres reputation and/or business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful. John Deere operates in highly competitive markets. John Deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets. John Deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. John Deere competes on the basis of product performance, innovation and quality, distribution, customer service and price. Aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing delays or John Deeres failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect John Deeres business, results of operations and financial condition. John Deere is subject to extensive anti-corruption laws and regulations. John Deeres global operations must comply with all applicable laws, which may include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act or other anti-corruption laws. These anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Although John Deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws, violations of these laws could result in criminal or civil sanctions and an adverse effect on John Deeres reputation, business and results of operations and financial condition. Negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for John Deeres equipment and services, limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs. The demand for John Deeres products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment, cautious consumer spending, lower corporate earnings, U.S. budget issues and lower business investment. Negative or uncertain economic conditions causing John Deeres customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their propensity to purchase John Deeres equipment. Sustained negative economic conditions and outlook affect housing starts and other construction which dampens demand for certain construction equipment. John Deeres turf operations and its construction and forestry business are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions. Sustained low levels or decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on John Deeres results of operations. If negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy, there could be a similar effect on John Deeres agricultural equipment sales. In addition, uncertain or negative outlook with respect to ongoing U.S. budget issues as well as general economic conditions and outlook can cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions. Such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs, which could reduce the Companys earnings and cash flows. Additionally, the Companys investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets, which would negatively affect earnings. In addition, demand for John Deeres products and services can be significantly reduced by concerns regarding the diverse economic and political circumstances of the individual countries in the eurozone, the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, and the long term stability of the euro as a single common currency.  Persistent disparity with respect to the widely varying economic conditions within the individual countries in the eurozone, and its implications for the euro as well as market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Companys euro- denominated assets and obligations, have an adverse effect on demand for John Deeres products and services in the eurozone and have an adverse effect on financial markets in Europe and globally. More specifically, it could affect the ability of John Deeres customers, suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses, to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs, if at all, the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for John Deeres products. The Companys consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries, creating currency translation risk. John Deere operates in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. John Deere is subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that its costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which John Deere earn revenues. Additionally, the reporting currency for the Companys consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of John Deeres assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries currencies. Those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the Companys consolidated financial statements. 13Table of Contents Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements, even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency. Substantial fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar could have a significant impact on John Deeres results. Because the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deeres sales worldwide, John Deeres operations and financial results could be impacted materially should negative economic conditions affect the financial industry. In recent years, negative economic conditions have frequently had an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates. The financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deeres sales worldwide. The financial services segment is exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractual obligations. The financial services segment may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The financial services segments inability to access funds at cost-effective rates to support its financing activities could have a material adverse effect on John Deeres business. The financial services segments liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital to meet future cash flow requirements and fund operations and the costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities. Additionally, negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels, resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact the financial services segments write-offs and provision for credit losses. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Act) and the regulations implementing the Act impose additional supervisory, financial and reporting requirements and compliance costs on John Deere and John Deeres financial services operations and could therefore adversely affect John Deere and its financial services segment. The Act was enacted on July 21, 2010 to broadly reform practices in the financial services industry, including equipment financing and securitizations. The Act directs federal agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and others, to adopt rules to regulate depository institutions, non-bank financial institutions, thrift holding companies, the consumer finance industry and the capital markets, including certain commercial transactions such as derivatives contracts. Although the effects of the Act on the capital markets and the financial industry are largely unknown until all the regulations have been finalized and implemented, the Act and its regulations impose additional reporting requirements, stress testing requirements, leverage, capital and other supervisory and financial standards and restrictions that increase regulatory-related compliance costs for John Deere and John Deeres financial services operations and could adversely affect John Deere and its financial services segments funding activities, liquidity, structure (including relationships with affiliates), operations and performance. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has recently finalized capital requirements for certain institutions including thrift holding companies. Under the final rules, certain risk-based capital levels will need to be maintained in order to avoid the imposition of new restrictions on making dividends and other capital payouts. Moreover, John Deeres operations, including those outside of the United States, will also be impacted by non-U.S. regulatory reforms, including Basel III, being implemented to further regulate non-U.S. financial institutions and markets. John Deeres business results depend largely on its ability to understand its customers specific preferences and requirements, and to develop, manufacture and market products that meet customer demand. John Deeres ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality, at affordable prices, is critical to its success. This requires a thorough understanding of John Deeres existing and potential customers on a global basis, particularly in potentially high-growth markets, including Brazil, China, India and Russia. Failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on John Deeres business. John Deeres business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment. Poor or unusual weather conditions, particularly during the planting and early growing season, can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of John Deeres customers, particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment. The timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production. Insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields. Excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting from occurring at optimal times, and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth. Temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields, and may also affect disease incidence. Temperature affects the rate of growth, crop maturity and crop quality. Natural calamities such as regional floods, hurricanes or other storms, and droughts can have significant negative effects on 14Table of Contents agricultural and livestock production. The resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment. In addition, poor or unusual weather conditions at critical periods in the planting, growing or harvesting seasons can impact the profitability of crop risk mitigation products. Sales of turf equipment, particularly during the important spring selling season, can be dramatically impacted by weather. Adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment. Drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes. Changes in the availability and price of certain raw materials, components and whole goods could result in production disruptions or increased costs and lower profits on sales of John Deere products. John Deere requires access to various raw materials, components and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products. Changes in the availability and price of these raw materials, components and whole goods, which have fluctuated significantly in the past and are more likely to fluctuate during times of economic volatility, can significantly increase the costs of production which could have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business, particularly if John Deere, due to pricing considerations or other factors, is unable to recover the increased costs from its customers. John Deere relies on suppliers to acquire raw materials, components and whole goods required to manufacture its products. Certain components and parts used in John Deeres products are available from a single supplier and cannot be re-sourced quickly. Supply chain disruptions due to supplier financial distress, capacity constraints, business continuity, quality, delivery or disruptions due to weather-related or natural disaster events could affect John Deeres operations and profitability. John Deeres equipment operations and financial services segment are subject to interest rate risks. Changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment, adversely affect interest margins and limit the ability to access capital markets while increasing borrowing costs. Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of John Deeres customers, either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for John Deere equipment and customers ability to repay obligations to John Deere. In addition, credit market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs which are very important to John Deeres financial services segment because such costs affect the segments ability to offer customers competitive financing rates. In addition, changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the Companys net interest rate marginthe difference between the yield the Company earns on its assets and the interest rates the Company pays for funding, which could in turn affect the Companys net interest income and earnings. Actions by credit rating agencies, such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks, can affect the availability and cost of funding for the Company and can increase the Companys cost of capital and hurt its competitive position. John Deeres operations are subject to and affected by increasingly rigorous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations of federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and various regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over John Deeres international operations. In addition, private civil litigation on these subjects has increased, primarily in the U.S. Enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental, health and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigation and defense costs, and result in significant fines or penalties. In addition, new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities could prevent or restrict John Deeres operations, require significant expenditures to achieve compliance and/or give rise to civil or criminal liability. There can be no assurance that violations of such legislation and/or regulations, or private civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental, health or safety impacts of John Deeres operations, would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on John Deeres business, financial condition or results of operations. Increasingly stringent engine emission standards could impact John Deeres ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment, which could negatively affect business results. John Deeres equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction standards, including USEPA, Interim Tier 4/Stage IIIb and Final Tier 4/Stage IV non-road diesel emission requirements in the U.S. and European Union. These standards are applicable to many engines manufactured by John Deere and used in many models of John Deere agriculture and construction and forestry equipment. John Deere has incurred and continues to incur substantial research and development costs and is introducing many new equipment models, largely due to the implementation of these more rigorous standards. While John Deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements and does not currently foresee significant obstacles that would prevent timely compliance, these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect John Deeres ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or engines, which could negatively impact business results. 15Table of Contents John Deere may incur increased costs due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards designed to address climate change and could be further impacted by physical effects attributed to climate change on its facilities, suppliers and customers. There is a growing political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) continue to alter the composition of Earths atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate. These considerations may lead to international, national, regional or local legislative or regulatory responses in the future. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, including John Deere, are considering ways to reduce GHG emissions. The regulation of GHG emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources could result in additional costs to John Deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances, facilities improvements and energy costs, which would increase John Deeres operating costs through higher utility, transportation and materials costs. The regulation of GHG emissions from non-road sources could require further changes to the design of John Deeres engines and equipment. Increased input costs, such as fuel and fertilizer, and compliance-related costs could also impact customer operations and demand for John Deere equipment. Because the impact of any future GHG legislative, regulatory or product standard requirements on John Deeres global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards, John Deere is unable to predict its potential impact at this time. Furthermore, the potential physical impacts of climate change on John Deeres facilities, suppliers and customers and therefore on John Deeres operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions. These may include changes in weather patterns (including drought and rainfall levels), water availability, storm patterns and intensities, and temperature levels. These potential physical effects may adversely impact the demand for John Deeres products and the cost, production, sales and financial performance of John Deeres operations. Sustained increases in funding obligations under the Companys pension plans may impair the Companys liquidity or financial condition. The Company maintains certain defined benefit pension plans for certain employees, which impose on us funding obligations. The Company uses many assumptions in calculating its future payment obligations under the plans. Significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of returns on pension investments being lower than expected. The Company may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future. These factors could significantly increase the Companys payment obligations under the plans and adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. The reallocation of radio frequency (RF) spectrums could disrupt or degrade the reliability of John Deeres high precision augmented Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, which could impair John Deeres ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions as well as significantly reduce agricultural and construction customers profitability. John Deeres current and planned integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems, as well as its fleet management telematics solutions for construction equipment, depend upon the use of RF signals.

For John Deeres agricultural customers, the inability to use high-precision augmented GPS signals or other RF signals could result in lower crop yields and higher equipment maintenance, seed, fertilizer, fuel and wage costs. For construction customers, disrupting GPS or RF applications could result in higher fuel and equipment maintenance costs, as well as lower construction design and project management efficiencies. These cost increases could significantly reduce customers profitability and demand for John Deere products. Security breaches and other disruptions to John Deeres information technology infrastructure could interfere with John Deeres operations and could compromise John Deeres and its customers and suppliers information, exposing John Deere to liability that would cause John Deeres business and reputation to suffer. In the ordinary course of business, John Deere relies upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments from dealers or other purchasers 16Table of Contents of John Deere equipment and from customers of John Deeres financial services operations. John Deere uses information technology systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Additionally, John Deere collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of John Deeres customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of John Deeres customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to John Deeres business operations and strategy. Despite security measures and business continuity plans, John Deeres information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise John Deeres networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations, and damage John Deeres reputation, which could adversely affect John Deeres business. "

John Deeres profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace. Restricted access to global markets impairs John Deeres ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world, and limits the ability to access raw materials and high quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis. While trade agreements may expand opportunities, trade restrictions could limit John Deeres ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair John Deeres ability to expand the business by offering new technologies, products and services. Furthermore, the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to John Deeres agricultural and forestry customers. Policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities, including the outcome of the global negotiations under the auspices of the World Trade Organization, could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities which may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world. John Deeres agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world. Furthermore, trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living, which could negatively impact John Deeres future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food, fuel and infrastructure. Furthermore, changes in government farm programs and policies, including direct payment and other subsidies, can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment. Changes in government banking, monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on John Deere. Policies of the U.S. and other governments regarding banking, monetary and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity, stabilize financial markets and/or address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on John Deeres customers and markets. John Deeres operations and results could also be impacted by financial regulatory reform which could have an adverse affect on the financial services segment and John Deeres customers by limiting their ability to finance purchases of John Deere products. Governmental policies on taxes and spending can also affect John Deere, especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development. Changing worldwide demand for food and for different forms of bio-energy could have an effect on the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain John Deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements. Changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the worlds growing food and bio-energy demands, driven in part by government policies and a growing world population, are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices, which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment. While higher commodity prices will benefit John Deeres crop producing agricultural equipment customers, higher commodity prices also result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers. Furthermore, changing bio-fuel demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise, with corresponding changes in equipment demands. Finally, changes in governmental policies regulating bio-fuel utilization could affect demand for John Deeres gasoline- or diesel-fueled equipment and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards. 11Table of Contents As John Deere seeks to expand its business globally, growth opportunities may be impacted by greater political, economic and social uncertainty and the continuing and accelerating globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of John Deeres competition, customer base and product offerings. John Deeres efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent upon access to, and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in, additional geographic markets including but not limited to Brazil, China, India and Russia. In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than John Deeres other markets. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes John Deere to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices, business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, property ownership rights, taxation and repatriation of earnings and advanced technologies. Expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the Companys financial results. As these emerging geographic markets become more important to John Deere, its competitors are also seeking to expand their production capacities and sales in these same markets. While John Deere maintains a positive corporate image and the John Deere brand is widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets, the brand is less well known in some emerging markets which could impede John Deeres efforts to successfully compete in these markets. Although John Deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances, John Deeres reputation and/or business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful. John Deere operates in highly competitive markets. John Deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets. John Deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. John Deere competes on the basis of product performance, innovation and quality, distribution, customer service and price. Aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing delays or John Deeres failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect John Deeres business, results of operations and financial condition. John Deere is subject to extensive anti-corruption laws and regulations. John Deeres international operations must comply with U.S. law, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).  The FCPA and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in the foreign jurisdiction.  Recently, there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws.  Although John Deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws, violations of these laws could result in criminal or civil sanctions and an adverse effect on John Deeres reputation, business and results of operations and financial condition. Negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for John Deeres equipment and services, limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs. The demand for John Deeres products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment, cautious consumer spending, lower corporate earnings and lower business investment. Negative or uncertain economic conditions causing John Deeres customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their propensity to purchase John Deeres equipment. Sustained or negative economic conditions and outlook affect housing starts and other construction which dampens demand for certain construction equipment. John Deeres turf operations and its construction and forestry segment are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions. Sustained low levels or decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations. If negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy, there could be a similar effect on John Deeres agricultural equipment sales. In addition, negative or uncertain economic conditions and outlook can cause significant changes in capital market liquidity conditions. Such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs, which could reduce the Companys earnings and cash flows. Additionally, the Companys investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets, which would negatively affect earnings. Concerns regarding the European debt crisis and market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro, the potential re-introduction of individual currencies within the Eurozone, or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely, could adversely affect John Deeres business, results of operations and financing. Concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Eurozone countries. These concerns could lead to the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or more Eurozone countries, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the 12Table of Contents Companys euro- denominated assets and obligations. In addition, concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions in Europe and globally could have an adverse impact on the capital markets generally, and more specifically on the ability of the Company and John Deeres customers, suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses, to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs, if at all, on the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for John Deere products. The Companys consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries, creating currency translation risk. John Deere operates in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies.  John Deere is subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues.  Additionally, the reporting currency for the Companys consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of John Deeres assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries currencies. Those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the Companys consolidated financial statements. Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements, even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency. Substantial fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar could have a significant impact on John Deeres results. Because the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deere sales worldwide, John Deeres operations and financial results could be impacted materially should negative economic conditions affect the financial industry. In recent years, negative economic conditions have frequently had an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates. The financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deeres sales worldwide. The financial services segment is exposed to the credit risk of its various counterparties. The financial services segment may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The financial services segments inability to access funds or to access funds at cost effective rates to support its financing activities to John Deeres customers could have a material adverse effect on John Deeres business. The financial services segments liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital to meet future cash flow requirements and fund operations and the costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities. Additionally, negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels, resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact the financial services segments write-offs and provision for credit losses. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Act), and the regulations implementing the Act, could impose additional supervisory, financial and reporting requirements and compliance costs on John Deere and John Deeres financial services operations and could therefore adversely affect John Deere and its financial services segment. The Act was enacted on July 21, 2010 to broadly reform practices in the financial services industry, including equipment financing and securitizations. The Act directs federal agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and others, to adopt rules to regulate depository institutions, non-bank financial institutions, thrift holding companies, the consumer finance industry and the capital markets, including certain commercial transactions such as derivatives contracts. Although the effects of the Act on the capital markets and the financial industry are largely unknown until regulations have been finalized and implemented, the Act and its regulations are expected to impose additional reporting requirements, leverage, capital and other supervisory and financial standards and restrictions that increase regulatory-related compliance costs for John Deere and John Deeres financial services operations and could adversely affect John Deere and its financial services segments funding activities, liquidity, structure (including relationships with affiliates), operations and performance. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board has recently proposed capital requirements for certain institutions including thrift holding companies.  Under the proposed rules, certain risk-based capital levels would need to be maintained in order to avoid the imposition of new restrictions on making dividends and other capital payouts.  Moreover, our operations, including those outside of the United States, could also be impacted by non-U.S. regulatory reforms, including Basel III, being implemented to further regulate non-U.S. financial institutions and markets. John Deeres business results depend largely on its ability to understand its customers specific preferences and requirements, and to develop, manufacture and market products that meet customer demand. John Deeres ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality, at affordable prices, is critical to its success. This requires a thorough understanding of John Deeres existing and potential customers on a global basis, particularly in potential high growth markets, including Brazil, China, India and Russia. Failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on John Deeres business. 13Table of Contents John Deeres business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for agricultural and turf equipment. Poor or unusual weather conditions, particularly during the planting and early growing season, can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of John Deeres customers, particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment. The timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production. Insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields. Excessive rain or flooding can also prevent planting from occurring at optimal times, and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth. Temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields, and may also affect disease incidence. Temperature affects the rate of growth, crop maturity and crop quality. Natural calamities such as regional floods, hurricanes or other storms, and droughts can have significant negative effects on agricultural production. The resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment. In addition, poor or unusual weather conditions at critical periods in the planting, growing or harvesting seasons can impact the profitability of crop risk mitigation products. Sales of turf equipment, particularly during the important spring selling season, can be dramatically impacted by weather. Adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment. Drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes. Changes in the availability and price of certain raw materials, components and whole goods could result in production disruptions or increased costs and lower profits on sales of John Deere products. John Deere requires access to various raw materials, components and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products. Changes in the availability and price of these raw materials, components and whole goods, which have fluctuated significantly in the past and which are more likely to occur during times of economic volatility, can significantly increase the costs of production which could have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business, particularly if John Deere, due to pricing considerations or other factors, was unable to recover the increased costs from its customers. John Deere relies on suppliers to acquire raw materials, components and whole goods required to manufacture its products. Certain components and parts used in John Deeres products are available from a single supplier and cannot be re-sourced quickly. Supply chain disruptions due to supplier financial viability, capacity constraints, business continuity, quality, delivery, or disruptions due to weather related or natural disaster events could affect John Deeres operations and profitability. John Deeres equipment operations and financial services segment are subject to interest rate risks. Changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment, adversely affect interest margins and limit the ability to access capital markets while increasing borrowing costs. Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of John Deeres customers, either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for John Deere equipment and customers ability to repay obligations to John Deere. In addition, credit market dislocations, including as a result of Eurozone concerns, could have an impact on funding costs which are very important to John Deeres financial services segment because such costs affect the segments ability to offer customers competitive financing rates. In addition, changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the Companys net interest rate marginthe difference between the yield the Company earns on its assets and the interest rates the Company pays for funding, which could in turn affect the Companys net interest income and earnings. Actions by credit rating agencies, such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks, can affect the availability and cost of funding for the Company and can increase the Companys cost of capital and hurt its competitive position. John Deeres operations are subject to and affected by increasingly rigorous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations of federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and various regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over John Deeres international operations. In addition, private civil litigation on these subjects has increased, primarily in the U.S. Enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental, health and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigation and defense costs, and result in significant fines or penalties. In addition, new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities could prevent or restrict John Deeres operations, require significant expenditures to achieve compliance and/or give rise to civil or criminal liability. There can be no assurance that violations of such legislation and/or regulations, or private civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental, health or safety impacts of John Deeres operations, would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on John Deeres business, financial condition or results of operations. Increasingly stringent engine emission standards could impact John Deeres ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment which could negatively affect business results. John Deeres equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction standards, including USEPA, Interim Tier 4, Final Tier 4 and EU Stage IIIb and Stage IV non-road diesel emission requirements. These standards are applicable to many engines manufactured by John Deere and used in many models of John Deere agricultural and construction and forestry equipment. In order to meet these standards, John Deere has incurred and continues to incur substantial research and development costs and is introducing many new equipment models, largely due to the implementation of these more rigorous standards. While John Deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements, and does not currently foresee significant obstacles that 14Table of Contents would prevent timely compliance, these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect John Deeres ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or engines, which could negatively impact business results. John Deere may incur increased costs due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards designed to address climate change and could be further impacted by physical effects attributed to climate change on its facilities, suppliers and customers. There is a growing political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate. These considerations may lead to international, national, regional or local legislative or regulatory responses in the future. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, including John Deere, are considering ways to reduce GHG emissions. The regulation of GHG emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources could result in additional costs to John Deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances, facilities improvements and energy costs (which would increase John Deeres operating costs through higher utility, transportation and materials costs). The regulation of GHG emissions from non-road sources could require further changes to the design of John Deeres engines and equipment. Increased input costs, such as fuel and fertilizer, and compliance-related costs could also impact customer operations and demand for John Deere equipment. Because the impact of any future GHG legislative, regulatory or product standard requirements on John Deeres global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of the mandates or standards, John Deere is unable to predict its significance at this time. Furthermore, the potential physical impacts of climate change on John Deeres facilities, suppliers and customers, and therefore on John Deeres operations, are highly uncertain, and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions. These may include changes in weather patterns (including drought and rainfall levels), water availability, storm patterns and intensities, and temperature levels. These potential physical effects may adversely impact the demand for John Deeres products and the cost, production, sales and financial performance of John Deeres operations. Sustained increases in funding obligations under the Companys pension plans may impair our liquidity or financial condition. The Company maintains certain defined benefit pension plans for certain employees, which impose on us funding obligations. The Company uses many assumptions in calculating its future payment obligations under the plans. Significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of returns being lower than expected. The Company may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future. These factors could significantly increase the Companys payment obligations under the plans and adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. The reallocation of radio frequency (RF) spectrums could disrupt or degrade the reliability of John Deeres high precision augmented Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, which could impair John Deeres ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions as well as significantly reduce agricultural and construction customers profitability. John Deeres current and planned integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems, as well as its fleet management telematics solutions for construction equipment, depend upon the use of RF signals. These signals include, but are not limited to, GPS signals, other GPS-like satellite signals, augmented GPS services and other RF equipment which link equipment, operations, owners, dealers and technicians. These radio services depend on frequency allocations governed by international and national agencies. Any international or national reallocation of frequency bands, including frequency bands segmentation and band spectrum sharing, or other modifications concerning the regulation of frequency bands, could significantly disrupt or degrade the utility and reliability of John Deeres GPS-based products, which could negatively affect John Deeres ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions. For John Deeres agricultural customers, the inability to use high-precision augmented GPS signals (or other RF signals) could result in lower crop yields and higher equipment maintenance, seed, fertilizer, fuel and wage costs. For construction customers, disrupting GPS (or RF) applications could result in higher fuel and equipment maintenance costs, as well as lower construction design and project management efficiencies. These cost increases could significantly reduce customers profitability and demand for John Deere products. Security breaches and other disruptions to John Deeres information technology infrastructure could interfere with John Deeres operations, and could compromise John Deeres and its customers and suppliers information, exposing John Deere to liability which would cause John Deeres business and reputation to suffer. In the ordinary course of business, John Deere relies upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing, and collection of payments from dealers or other purchasers of John Deere equipment and from customers of John Deeres financial services operations. John Deere uses information technology systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Additionally, John Deere collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, the proprietary business information of our customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of John Deeres customers and employees, in data centers and on information 15Table of Contents technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks, and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to John Deeres business operations and strategy. Despite security measures and business continuity plans, John Deeres information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance, or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise John Deeres networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations, and damage John Deeres reputation, which could adversely affect John Deeres business. "
15,DE,DEERE & CO,2011-12-19,"ITEM 1A.              RISK FACTORS. The following risks are considered the most significant to John Deeres business based upon current knowledge, information and assumptions. This discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 19 and, specifically, the risks and uncertainties described in the Safe Harbor Statement on pages 21 and 22. These risk factors and other forward-looking statements that relate to future events, expectations, trends and operating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change, and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business, while others could affect all of the Companys businesses. Although each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. The Company, except as required by law, undertakes no obligation to update or revise this risk factors discussion. International, national and regional trade laws, regulations and policies (particularly those related to or restricting global trade) and government farm programs and policies, could significantly impair John Deeres profitability and growth prospects. International, national and regional laws, regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting trade, including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors, could harm John Deeres multinational business. John Deeres profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace. Restricted access to global markets impairs John Deeres ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world, and limits the ability to access raw materials and high quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis. While trade agreements may expand opportunities, trade restrictions could limit John Deeres ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair John Deeres ability to expand the business by offering new technologies, products and services. Furthermore, the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to John Deeres agricultural and forestry customers. Policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities, including the outcome of the global negotiations under the auspices of the World Trade Organization, could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities which may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world. John Deeres agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world. Furthermore, trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living, which could negatively impact John Deeres future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food, fuel and infrastructure. Furthermore, changes in government farm program and policies, including direct payment and other subsidies, can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment. Changes in government banking, monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on John Deere. Policies of the U.S. and other governments regarding banking, monetary and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity and/or stabilize financial markets may not be effective and could have a material impact on John Deeres customers and markets. John Deeres operations and results could also be impacted by financial regulatory reform which could have an adverse affect on the financial services segment and John Deeres customers by limiting their ability to finance purchases of John Deere products. Governmental policies on taxes and spending can also affect John Deere, especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development. Changing worldwide demand for food and for different forms of bio-energy could have an effect on the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain John Deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements. Changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the worlds growing food and bio-energy demands, driven in part by government policies and a growing world population, are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices, which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment. While higher commodity prices will benefit John Deeres crop producing agricultural equipment customers, higher commodity prices also result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers. Furthermore, changing bio-fuel demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise, with corresponding changes in equipment demands. Finally, changes in governmental policies regulating bio-fuel utilization could affect demand for John Deeres gasoline- or diesel-fueled equipment and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards. 10 As John Deere seeks to expand its business globally, growth opportunities may be impacted by greater political, economic and social uncertainty and the continuing and accelerating globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of John Deeres competition, customer base and product offerings. John Deeres efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent upon access to, and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in, additional geographic markets including but not limited to Brazil, China, India and Russia. In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than John Deeres other markets. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes John Deere to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices, business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, property ownership rights, taxation and repatriation of earnings and advanced technologies. Expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the Companys financial results. As these emerging geographic markets become more important to John Deere, its competitors are also seeking to expand their production capacities and sales in these same markets. While John Deere maintains a positive corporate image and the John Deere brand is widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets, the brand is less well known in some emerging markets which could impede John Deeres efforts to successfully compete in these markets. Although John Deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances, John Deeres reputation and/or business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful. Negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for John Deeres equipment and services, limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs. The demand for John Deeres products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment, cautious consumer spending, lower corporate earnings and lower business investment. Negative or uncertain economic conditions causing John Deeres customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their propensity to purchase John Deeres equipment. Sustained or negative economic conditions and outlook affect housing starts and other construction which dampens demand for certain construction equipment. John Deeres turf operations and its construction and forestry segment are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions. Sustained low levels or decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations. If negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy, there could be a similar effect on John Deeres agricultural equipment sales. In addition, negative or uncertain economic conditions and outlook can cause significant changes in capital market liquidity conditions. Such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs, which could reduce the Companys earnings and cash flows. Additionally, the Companys investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets, which would negatively affect earnings. Concerns regarding the European debt crisis and market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro, the potential re-introduction of individual currencies within the Eurozone, or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely, could adversely affect John Deeres business, results of operations and financing. As a result of the debt crisis with respect to countries in Europe, in particular most recently in Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, the European Commission created the European Financial Stability Facility (the EFSF) and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (the EFSM) to provide funding to countries using the euro as their currency (the Eurozone) that are in financial difficulty and seek such support. In March 2011, the European Council agreed on the need for Eurozone countries to establish a permanent financial stability mechanism, the European Stability Mechanism (the ESM), which will be activated by mutual agreement, to assume the role of the EFSF and the EFSM in providing external financial assistance to Eurozone countries after June 2013. Despite these measures, concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Eurozone countries. These concerns could lead to the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or more Eurozone countries, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Companys euro- denominated assets and obligations. In addition, concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions in Europe and globally could have an adverse impact on the capital markets generally, and more specifically on the ability of the Company and John Deeres customers, suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses, to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs, if at all, on the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for John Deere products. 11 The Companys consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries, creating currency translation risk. The reporting currency for the Companys consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries currencies. Those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the Companys consolidated financial statements. Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements, even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency. Substantial fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar could have a significant impact on the Companys results. Because the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deere sales worldwide, John Deeres operations and financial results could be impacted materially should negative economic conditions affect the financial industry. In recent years, negative economic conditions have frequently had an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates. The financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deeres sales worldwide. The financial services segments inability to access funds or to access funds at cost effective rates to support its financing activities to John Deeres customers could have a material adverse effect on John Deeres business. The financial services segments liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital to meet future cash flow requirements and fund operations and the costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities. Additionally, negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels, resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact the financial services segments write-offs and provisions for credit losses. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Act), and the regulations implementing the Act, could impose additional supervisory, financial and reporting requirements and compliance costs on the Company and the Companys financial services operations and could therefore adversely affect the Company and its financial services segment. The Act was enacted on July 21, 2010 to broadly reform practices in the financial services industry, including equipment financing and securitizations. The Act directs federal agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Reserve, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and others, to adopt rules to regulate depository institutions, non-bank financial institutions, thrift holding companies, the consumer finance industry and the capital markets, including certain commercial transactions such as derivatives contracts. Although the effects of the Act on the capital markets and the financial industry are largely unknown until regulations have been finalized and implemented, the Act and its regulations could impose additional reporting requirements, leverage, capital and other supervisory and financial standards and restrictions that increase regulatory-related compliance costs for the Company and the Companys financial services operations and could adversely affect the Company and its financial services segments funding activities, liquidity, structure (including relationships with affiliates), operations and performance. John Deeres business results depend largely on its ability to understand its customers specific preferences and requirements, and to develop, manufacture and market products that meet customer demand. John Deeres ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality, at affordable prices, is critical to its success. This requires a thorough understanding of John Deeres existing and potential customers on a global basis, particularly in potential high growth markets, including Brazil, China, India and Russia. Failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on John Deeres business. John Deeres business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for agricultural and turf equipment. Poor or unusual weather conditions, particularly during the planting and early growing season, can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of John Deeres customers, particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment. The timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production. Insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields. Excessive rain or flooding can also prevent planting from occurring at optimal times, and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth. Temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields, and may also affect disease incidence. Temperature affects the rate of growth, crop maturity and crop quality. Natural calamities such as regional floods, hurricanes or other storms, and droughts can have significant negative effects on agricultural production. The resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment. Sales of turf equipment, particularly during the important spring selling season, can be dramatically impacted by weather. Adverse weather 12 conditions in a particular geographic region may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment. Drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes. Changes in the availability and price of certain raw materials, components and whole goods could result in production disruptions or increased costs and lower profits on sales of John Deere products. John Deere requires access to various raw materials, components and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products. Changes in the availability and price of these raw materials, components and whole goods, which have fluctuated significantly in the past and which are more likely to occur during times of economic volatility, can significantly increase the costs of production which could have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business, particularly if John Deere, due to pricing considerations or other factors, was unable to recover the increased costs from its customers. Supply chain disruptions due to supplier financial viability, capacity constraints, business continuity, quality, delivery, or disruptions due to weather related or natural disaster events could similarly affect John Deeres operations and profitability. John Deeres equipment operations and financial services segment are subject to interest rate risks. Changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment, adversely affect interest margins and limit the ability to access capital markets while increasing borrowing costs. Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of John Deeres customers, either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for John Deere equipment and customers ability to repay obligations to John Deere. In addition, credit market dislocations, including as a result of Eurozone concerns, could have an impact on funding costs which are very important to the Companys financial services segment because such costs affect the segments ability to offer customers competitive financing rates. In addition, changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the Companys net interest rate marginthe difference between the yield the Company earns on its assets and the interest rates the Company pays for funding, which could in turn affect the Companys net interest income and earnings. Actions by credit rating agencies, such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks, can affect the availability and cost of funding for the Company and can increase the Companys cost of capital and hurt its competitive position. John Deeres operations are subject to and affected by increasingly rigorous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations of federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and various regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over John Deeres international operations. In addition, private civil litigation on these subjects has increased, primarily in the U.S. Enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental, health and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigation and defense costs, and result in significant fines or penalties. In addition, new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities could prevent or restrict John Deeres operations, require significant expenditures to achieve compliance and/or give rise to civil or criminal liability. There can be no assurance that violations of such legislation and/or regulations, or private civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental, health or safety impacts of John Deeres operations, would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on John Deeres business, financial condition or results of operations. Increasingly stringent engine emission standards could impact John Deeres ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment which could negatively affect business results. John Deeres equipment operations must meet new and increasingly stringent engine emission reduction standards, including Interim Tier 4, Final Tier 4 and Stage IIIb non-road diesel emission requirements applicable to many engines manufactured by John Deere and used in many models of John Deere agricultural and construction and forestry equipment. In order to meet these standards, John Deere has incurred and continues to incur substantial research and development costs and is introducing many new equipment models, largely due to the implementation of these more rigorous standards. While John Deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements, and does not currently foresee significant obstacles that would prevent timely compliance, these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect John Deeres ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or engines, which could negatively impact business results. John Deere may incur increased costs due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards designed to address climate change and could be further impacted by physical effects attributed to climate change on its facilities, suppliers and customers. There is a growing political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate. These considerations may lead to international, national, regional or local legislative or regulatory responses in the near future. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, including John Deere, are considering ways to reduce GHG emissions. The regulation of GHG emissions from certain stationary or mobile 13  sources could result in additional costs to John Deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances, facilities improvements and energy costs (which would increase John Deeres operating costs through higher utility, transportation and materials costs). The regulation of GHG emissions from non-road sources could require further changes to the design of John Deeres engines and equipment. Increased input costs, such as fuel and fertilizer, and compliance-related costs could also impact customer operations and demand for John Deere equipment. Because the impact of any future GHG legislative, regulatory or product standard requirements on John Deeres global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of the mandates or standards, John Deere is unable to predict its significance at this time. Furthermore, the potential physical impacts of climate change on John Deeres facilities, suppliers and customers, and therefore on John Deeres operations, are highly uncertain, and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions. These may include changes in weather patterns (including drought and rainfall levels), water availability, storm patterns and intensities, and temperature levels. These potential physical effects may adversely impact the cost, production, sales and financial performance of John Deeres operations. The reallocation of radio frequency spectrums could disrupt or degrade the reliability of John Deeres high precision augmented Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, which could impair John Deeres ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions as well as significantly reduce agricultural and construction customers profitability. John Deeres current and planned integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems, as well as its fleet management telematics solutions for construction equipment, depend upon the use of GPS signals and augmented GPS services which link equipment, operations, owners, dealers and technicians. These services depend on satellite and radio frequency allocations governed by international and local agencies. Any international or local reallocation of radio frequency bands, including frequency bands segmentation and band spectrum sharing, or other modifications of the permitted uses of frequency bands, could significantly disrupt or degrade the utility and reliability of John Deeres GPS-based products, which could negatively affect John Deeres ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions. For John Deeres agricultural customers, the inability to use high-precision augmented GPS services could result in lower crop yields and higher equipment maintenance, seed, fertilizer, fuel and wage costs. For construction customers, disrupting GPS applications could result in higher fuel and equipment maintenance costs, as well as lower construction design and project management efficiencies. These cost increases could significantly reduce customers profitability and demand for John Deere products. Security breaches and other disruptions to the Companys information technology infrastructure could interfere with the Companys operations, and could compromise the Companys and its customers and suppliers information, exposing the Company to liability which would cause the Companys business and reputation to suffer. In the ordinary course of business, the Company relies upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing, and collection of payments from dealers or other purchasers of John Deere equipment and from customers of the Companys financial services operations. The Company uses information technology systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Additionally, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, the propriety business information of our customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of the Companys customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks, and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to the Companys business operations and strategy. Despite security measures and business continuity plans, the Companys information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance, or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise the Companys networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations, and damage the Companys reputation, which could adversely affect the Companys business. "
7,DE,DEERE & CO,2010-12-17,"ITEM 1A.              RISK FACTORS. The following risks are considered the most significant to John Deeres business based upon current knowledge, information and assumptions. This discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 20 and, specifically, the risks and uncertainties described in the Safe Harbor Statement on pages 22 and 23. International, regional and national trade laws, regulations and policies (particularly those related to or restricting global trade) and government farm programs and policies, could significantly impact John Deeres profitability and growth prospects. International, regional and national laws, regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting trade, including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors, could harm John Deeres multinational business. John Deeres profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace. Open access to global markets improves John Deeres ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world, and affects the ability to access raw materials and high quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis. Trade restrictions could limit John Deeres ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair John Deeres ability to expand the business by offering new technologies, products and services. Furthermore, the ability to export commodities is critical to John Deeres agricultural and forestry customers. Policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities, including the outcome of the global negotiations under the auspices of the World Trade Organization, could have a material effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities which may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world. John Deeres agricultural equipment sales could be especially affected because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world. Trade restrictions could also impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living, which could negatively impact John Deeres future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food, fuel and infrastructure. Changes in government banking, monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on John Deere. Changes in policies of the U.S. and other governments regarding banking, monetary and fiscal policies to promote liquidity and increase the availability of credit may not be effective and could have a material impact on John Deeres customers and markets. John Deeres operations and results could also be impacted by financial regulatory reform which could have an adverse affect on the credit segment and/or John Deeres customers by limiting their ability to finance purchases of John Deere products. Governmental policies on taxes and spending can also affect John Deere, especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development. Changing worldwide demand for food and for different forms of bio-energy could have an effect on the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain John Deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements. Changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the worlds growing food and bio-energy demands, driven in part by government policies and a growing world population, are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices, which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment. While higher commodity prices may benefit John Deeres crop producing agricultural equipment customers, higher commodity prices also result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by those customers. Furthermore, changing bio-fuel demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise, with corresponding changes in equipment demands.  Finally, changes in governmental policies regulating bio-fuel utilization could affect demand for John Deeres gasoline- or diesel-fueled equipment and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards. 11 As John Deere seeks to expand its business globally, growth opportunities may be impacted by the continuing and accelerating globalization of businesses which could significantly change the dynamics of John Deeres competition, customer base and product offerings. John Deeres efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent upon access to, and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in, additional geographic markets including but not limited to Brazil, Russia, India and China. In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than John Deeres other markets. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes John Deere to multiple and potentially conflicting legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change; increased exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the Companys financial results and differing local customer product preferences and product requirements. As these emerging geographic markets become more important to John Deere, its competitors are seeking to expand their production capacities in these same markets. Although John Deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances, particularly by focusing on gaining customer understanding in high-growth potential emerging markets, John Deeres business efforts could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful. Negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for John Deeres equipment and services, limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs. The demand for John Deeres products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by higher unemployment, lower consumer spending, lower corporate earnings and lower business investment. Significant changes in market liquidity conditions could impact access to funding and associated funding costs, which could reduce the Companys earnings and cash flows. The Companys investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets, which would negatively affect earnings. General economic conditions can affect the demand for John Deeres equipment. Sustained or severe negative economic conditions and outlook resulting in decreased housing starts and other construction can dampen demand for certain construction equipment. John Deeres turf operations and construction and forestry segment are dependent on construction activity and positive general economic conditions. Significant or prolonged declines in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations. If negative economic conditions extend to the overall farm economy, there could be a similar effect on agricultural equipment sales. The Companys consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries, creating currency translation risk. The reporting currency for the Companys consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries currencies. Those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the Companys consolidated financial statements. Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements, even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency. Substantial fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar could have a significant impact on the Companys results. Because the credit segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deere sales worldwide, John Deeres operations and financial results could be impacted materially should negative economic conditions affect the financial industry. In recent years, negative economic conditions have frequently had an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the credit segment operates. The credit segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deere sales worldwide. The credit segments inability to access funds to support its financing activities to John Deeres customers could have a material adverse effect on John Deeres business. The credit segments liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital to meet future cash flow requirements and fund operations and the costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities. Additionally, sustained negative market conditions could further reduce customer confidence levels, resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact the credit segments write-offs and provisions for credit losses. 12 If John Deeres customers lack confidence in the general economic outlook, they are less likely to purchase John Deeres products. The attitudes of consumers about general economic conditions and outlook can significantly affect their propensity to purchase John Deere equipment. Continuing or worsening negative economic conditions could significantly impair customer confidence and result in reduced equipment sales. John Deeres business results depend largely on its ability to develop, manufacture and market products that meet customer demand. John Deeres ability to match its new product offerings to its customers anticipated preferences for enhanced technologies and different types and sizes of equipment is critical to its success. This requires a thorough understanding of John Deeres existing and potential customers on a global basis. Failure to deliver quality products at competitive prices to meet customer demands before competitors could have a significant adverse effect on John Deeres business. John Deeres business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for agricultural and turf equipment. Poor or unusual weather conditions, particularly during the planting and early growing season, can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of John Deeres customers, particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment.

Adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment. Drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes. Changes in the availability and price of raw materials can result in increased costs and lower profits on sales of John Deere products. John Deere requires access to various raw materials at competitive prices to manufacture its products. Changes in the availability and price of raw materials, which are more likely to occur during times of economic volatility, can significantly increase the costs of production which would have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business. John Deeres Equipment Operations and credit segment are subject to interest rate risks. Changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment, adversely affect interest margins and limit the ability to access capital markets while increasing borrowing costs. Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of John Deeres customers, either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for John Deere equipment and/or customers ability to repay obligations to John Deere.

In order to meet these standards, John Deere has incurred substantial research and development costs and in fiscal year 2011 will introduce a record number of new equipment models, largely due to the implementation of these more rigorous standards. While John Deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements, and does not currently foresee obstacles that would prevent timely compliance, these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect John Deeres ability to distribute certain equipment or engines, which could negatively impact business results. John Deere may incur increased costs due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards designed to address climate change and could be further impacted by physical effects attributed to climate change on its facilities, suppliers and customers. There is a growing political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate.

0,DE,DEERE & CO,2009-12-17,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS. GovernmentalActions. The Companys businesses are exposed to a variety of risks anduncertainties related to the action or inaction of governmental bodies. Theoutcome of the global negotiations under the auspices of the World TradeOrganization could have a material effect on the international flow ofagricultural commodities which may result in a corresponding effect on thedemand for agricultural equipment in many areas of the world. The policies ofthe Brazilian government (including those related to exchange rates andcommodity prices) and Argentine government could significantly change thedynamics of the agricultural economy in South America. Withrespect to the ongoing globaleconomic conditions, changes in governmental banking, monetary and fiscalpolicies to restore liquidity and increase the availability of credit may notbe effective and could have a material impact on the Companys customers andmarkets. To the extent that the Company participates in governmental programsdesigned to address current negative conditions, both in the United States andin other countries, there is no assurance such programs will remain availablefor sufficient periods of time or  10 on acceptable terms tobenefit the Company, and the expiration of such programs could have unintendedadverse effects. In addition, certain competitors may be eligible for certainprograms that the Company is ineligible for, which may create a competitivedisadvantage. The Companys operations and results could also be materiallyimpacted by financial regulatory reform. Governmental policies ontaxes and spending can also affect the Company, especially the construction andforestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructuredevelopment. ChangingDemand for Farm Outputs. Changing worldwide demand for food and the demand for different formsof bio-energy could have an effect on prices for farm commodities andconsequently the demand for the Companys agricultural equipment. In addition,global economic conditions may have an impact on agricultural commodity prices. Impact ofGlobalization.The continuing globalization of businesses may significantly change thedynamics of the Companys competition, customer base and product offerings. TheCompanys efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent on access to,and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in,additional geographic markets including but not limited to Brazil, Russia,India and China. In some cases, these countries have greater political andeconomic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labordisruptions. Operating in a large number of different regions and countriesexposes the Company to multiple regulatory requirements that are subject tochange; increased exposure to currency fluctuations; differing local productpreferences and product requirements; differing labor regulations and differingtax laws. Simultaneously, these emerging markets are becoming more important astheir economies grow, as other international companies grow globally and locallow cost manufacturers expand their production capacities. Economic Conditions and Outlook. Conditions in the global financialmarkets and general economy materially affect the Companys results ofoperations. The demand for the Companys products and services could beadversely affected in an economic environment characterized by higherunemployment, lower consumer spending, lower corporate earnings and lowerbusiness investment. Significant changes in market liquidity conditions couldimpact access to funding and associated funding costs, which could reduce theCompanys earnings and cash flows. The Companys investment management activitiescould be adversely impacted by changes in the equity and bond markets, whichwould negatively affect earnings. General economic conditions can affect thedemand for the Companys equipment. Current negative economic conditions and outlookhave decreased housing starts and other construction and dampened demand forcertain construction equipment. The Companys turf operations and itsconstruction and forestry segment are dependent on construction activity andgeneral economic conditions. Significant or prolonged declines in constructionactivity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on the Companysresults of operations. If continuing negative economic conditions extend to theoverall farm economy, there could be a similar effect on agricultural equipmentsales. CurrencyFluctuations. Thereporting currency for the Companys consolidated financial statements is theU.S. dollar. Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities, expenses andrevenues are denominated in other countries currencies. Those assets,liabilities, expenses and revenues are translated into U.S. dollars at theapplicable exchange rates to prepare the Companys consolidated financialstatements. Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between theU.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items asreflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements, even if theirvalue remains unchanged in their original currency. Substantial fluctuations inthe value of the U.S. dollar could have a significant impact on the Companysresults. Risks to Financial Services. Current negative economic conditionshave adversely affected the financial industry in which the credit segmentoperates. The credit segment provides financing to a significant portion ofJohn Deere sales worldwide. The credit segments inability to access funds tosupport its financing activities to the Companys customers could have amaterial adverse effect on the Companys business. The credit segments liquidityand ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital to meetfuture cash flow requirements and fund operations and the costs associated withengaging in diversified funding activities. Additionally, continued negativemarket conditions could further reduce customer confidence levels, resulting indeclines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and defaultrates, which could materially impact the credit segments write-offs andprovisions for credit losses. ConsumerAttitudes. Theconfidence the Companys customers have in the general economic outlook canhave a significant effect on their propensity to purchase equipment and,consequently, on the Companys sales. Continuing negative economic conditionscould significantly impair customer confidence. The Companys ability to matchits new product offerings to its customers anticipated preferences forenhanced technologies and different types and sizes of equipment is importantas well. WeatherConditions. Pooror unusual weather conditions, particularly in the spring, can significantlyaffect the purchasing decisions of the Companys customers, particularly thecustomers of the agriculture and turf segment. Sales of turf care equipment inthe important spring selling season can be dramatically impacted by weather. SupplyBase and Raw Material Costs. Many of the Companys suppliers also supply theautomotive industry. The severe downturn in automotive sales and the weakfinancial condition and restructuring of some major automakers could causethese suppliers to face severe financial hardship and disrupt the Companysaccess to critical components. Changes in the availability and price of raw  11 materials, which are morelikely to occur during times of economic volatility, could have a materialnegative impact on the Companys costs of production and, in turn, on theprofitability of the business. InterestRates and Credit Ratings. Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overalleconomic activity and could affect the demand for the Companys equipment. Inaddition, credit market dislocations could have an impact on funding costswhich are very important to the Companys credit segment. Decisions and actionsby credit rating agencies can affect the availability and cost of funding forthe Company. Credit rating downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlookscan increase the Companys cost of capital and hurt its competitive position.Guidance from rating agencies as to acceptable leverage can affect the Companysreturns as well. Environmental Risk. The Companys operations are subject to andaffected by increasingly rigorous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations of federal, state and local authorities in theUnited States and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over the Companysforeign operations.Violations of such laws or regulations can lead to investigation andremediation costs, significant fines or penalties. In addition, new or morestringent requirements of governmental authorities, and claims for damages toproperty or injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health orsafety impacts of the Companys operations or past contamination, could preventor restrict the Companys operations, require significant expenditures toachieve compliance, involve the imposition of cleanup liens and/or give rise tocivil or criminal liability. There can be no assurance that violations of suchlegislation and/or regulations, which could result in enforcement actions orprivate claims, would not have consequences that result in a material adverseeffect on the Companys business, financial condition or results of operations. Beginning in 2011, theCompanys Equipment Operations must meet new and increasingly stringent engineemission standards, including Interim Tier 4 and Stage IIIb nonroad dieselemission requirements applicable to many engines manufactured by the Companyand many models of John Deere agricultural and construction and forestryequipment. While the Company has developed and is executing comprehensive plansto meet these requirements, and does not currently foresee obstacles that wouldprevent timely compliance, these plans are subject to many variables that coulddelay or impact the Companys ability to distribute certain equipment orengines, which could negatively impact business results. Climate Change. There is a growingpolitical and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG)continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that areaffecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate. Variousstakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders andnon-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors,are considering ways to reduce GHG emissions. There is growing consensus thatsome form of U.S. regulation will be forthcoming at the federal level withrespect to greenhouse gas emissions and such regulation could result in thecreation of additional costs in the form of taxes or emission allowances. Theimpact of any future mandatory GHG legislative, regulatory or product standardrequirements on the Companys global businesses and products is dependent onthe design of the mandate or standard, and so the Company is unable to predictits significance at this time. Furthermore,the potential physical impacts of climate change on the Companys customers,and therefore on the Companys operations, are highly uncertain, and will beparticular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions.These may include changes in weather patterns (including drought and rainfalllevels), water availability, storm patterns and intensities, and temperaturelevels. These potential physical effects may adversely impact the cost,production, sales and financial performance of John Deeres operations. The risksidentified above should be considered in conjunction with ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis beginning on page 17 and, specifically, the otherrisks described in the Safe Harbor Statement on pages 19 and 20.

6,DE,DEERE & CO,2008-12-18,"ITEM 1A.              RISKFACTORS. Governmental Actions. The Companys agricultural business is exposed to avariety of risks and uncertainties related to the action or inaction ofgovernmental bodies. The outcome of the global negotiations under the auspicesof the World Trade Organization could have a material effect on theinternational flow of agricultural commodities which may result in acorresponding effect on the demand for agricultural equipment in many areas ofthe world. The policies of the Brazilian government (including those related toexchange rates and commodity prices) and Argentine government couldsignificantly change the dynamics of the agricultural economy in South America.With respect to the current global economic downturn, changes in governmentalbanking, monetary and fiscal policies to restore liquidity and increase theavailability of credit may not be effective and could have a material impact onthe Companys customers and markets. In addition, to the extent that the Company participates ingovernmental programs designed to address current conditions, both in the U.S.and outside the U.S., there is no assurance such programs will remain availablefor sufficient periods of time or on acceptable terms to benefit the Company,and the expiration of such programs could have unintended adverse effects. Inaddition, certain competitors may be eligible for certain programs that theCompany is ineligible for, which may create a competitive disadvantage. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the EESA) wassigned into law on October 3, 2008 to stabilize and provide liquidity toU.S. financial markets. There can be no assurance as to the actual impact ofthe implementing regulations of the EESA, or any other governmental program, onthe financial markets. The Companys business, financial condition, results ofoperations, access to credit, and trading price of common stock could bematerially and adversely affected if the financial markets fail to stabilize,or if current financial market conditions worsen. 8 The Company may also become subject to additional restrictions pursuantto participation in the EESAs specific programs. For example, John Deeresparticipation in the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program will requirethe payment of certain fees to the FDIC. The costs of participation ornon-participation in any such program, as well as the effect of such programson the Companys results of operations, cannot be reliably determined at thistime. Changing Demand for Farm Outputs.Changing worldwide demand for food and the demand for different forms ofbio-energy could have an effect on prices for farm commodities and consequentlythe demand for the Companys agricultural equipment. In addition, globaleconomic conditions may have an impact on commodity prices. Globalization. Thecontinuing globalization of agricultural businesses may significantly changethe dynamics of the Companys competition, customer base and product offerings.The Companys efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent on accessto, and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in,additional geographic markets including but not limited to Brazil, Russia,India and China. In some cases, these countries have greater political andeconomic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labordisruptions. Operating in a large number of different regions and countriesexposes the Company to multiple regulatory requirements that are subject tochange; increased exposure to currency fluctuations; differing local productpreferences and product requirements; differing labor regulations and differingtax laws. Simultaneously, these emerging markets are becoming more competitiveas other international companies grow globally and local low cost manufacturersexpand their production capacities. Economic Condition and Outlook. Recent significant changes in marketliquidity conditions could impact access to funding and associated fundingcosts, which could reduce the Companys earnings and cash flows. The Companysinvestment management operations could be adversely impacted by changes in theequity and bond markets, which would negatively affect earnings. Generaleconomic conditions can affect the demand for the Companys equipment. Currentnegative economic conditions and outlook have decreased housing starts andother construction and dampened demand for certain construction equipment. TheCompanys commercial and consumer equipment and construction and forestrysegments are dependent on construction activity and general economicconditions. A significant or prolonged decline in construction activity andhousing starts could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results ofoperations if current economic difficulties, as well as depressed housing markets,continue into the foreseeable future. If current economic conditions extend tothe overall farm economy, there could be a similar effect on agriculturalequipment sales. The volatility in global financial markets has reached unprecedentedlevels. Global financial market downturns began in the second half of 2007, andsignificantly increased during the fourth quarter of 2008. Volatile oil prices,falling equity market values, declining business, weakened consumer confidence,and risks of increased inflation and deflation and increased unemployment rateshave created fears of a severe recession. Conditions in the global financialmarkets and general economy materially affect the Companys results ofoperations. The demand for the Companys products and services could beadversely affected in an economic crisis characterized by higher unemployment,lower consumer spending, lower corporate earnings, and lower businessinvestment. Currency Fluctuations.The reporting currency for the Companys consolidated financial statements isthe U.S. dollar. Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities, expenses andrevenues are denominated in other countries currencies. Those assets,liabilities, expenses and revenues are translated into U.S. dollars at theapplicable exchange rates to prepare the Companys consolidated financialstatements. Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between theU.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items asreflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements, even if theirvalue remains unchanged in their original currency. Substantial fluctuations inthe value of the U.S. dollar could have a continuing and significant impact onthe Companys results. Risks to Financial Services Segment. The current economic downturn andmarket volatility have adversely affected the financial industry in which thecredit segment operates. The credit segment provides financing to a significantportion of John Deere sales worldwide. The credit segments inability to accessfunds to support its financing activities to the Companys customers could havea material adverse effect on the Companys business. The credit segmentsliquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capitalto meet future cash flow requirements and fund operations and the costsassociated with engaging in diversified funding activities. In recent weeks,the credit markets have reached unprecedented levels of volatility, resultingin reduced levels of liquidity and disruption of domestic and foreign financialmarkets. If current levels of market disruption and volatility continue orworsen, funding could be unavailable or insufficient. Additionally, undercurrent market conditions customer confidence levels may result in declines incredit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, whichcould materially impact the credit segments write-offs and provisions forcredit losses. Consumer Attitudes.The confidence the Companys customers have in the general economic outlook canhave a significant effect on their propensity to purchase equipment and,consequently, on the Companys sales. Current negative economic conditionscould significantly impair customer confidence. The Companys ability to match itsnew product offerings to its customers anticipated preferences for enhancedtechnologies and different types and sizes of equipment is important as well. 9 Weather. Poor orunusual weather conditions, particularly in the spring, can significantlyaffect the purchasing decisions of the Companys customers, particularly thecustomers of the agricultural and commercial and consumer segments. Sales inthe important spring selling season can have a dramatic effect on thecommercial and consumer segments financial results. Supply Base and Raw Material Costs.Many of the Companys suppliers also supply the automotive industry. The severedownturn in automotive sales and the weak financial condition of some majorautomakers could cause these suppliers to face severe financial hardship anddisrupt the Companys access to critical components. Changes in theavailability and price of raw materials, which are more likely to occur duringtimes of economic volatility, could have a material negative impact on theCompanys costs of production and, in turn, on the profitability of thebusiness. Interest Rates and Credit Ratings.If interest rates rise, they could have a dampening effect on overall economicactivity and could affect the demand for the Companys equipment. In addition,credit market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs which are veryimportant to the Companys credit segment. Decisions and actions by creditrating agencies can affect the availability and cost of funding for theCompany. Credit rating downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks canincrease the Companys cost of capital and hurt its competitive position.Guidance from rating agencies as to acceptable leverage can affect the Companysreturns as well. Environmental. The Companys operations are subject toand affected by environmental, health and safety laws and regulations byfederal, state and local authorities in the United States and regulatoryauthorities with jurisdiction over the Companys foreign operations.Violations of such laws or regulations can lead to investigation andremediation costs, significant fines or penalties. In addition, increasedrequirements of governmental authorities, and claims for damages to property orinjury to persons resulting from the environmental, health or safety impacts ofthe Companys operations or past contamination, could prevent or restrict theCompanys operations, require significant expenditures to achieve compliance,involve the imposition of cleanup liens and/or give rise to civil or criminalliability. There can be no assurance that violations of such legislation and/orregulations, which could result in enforcement actions or private claims wouldnot have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on the Companysbusiness, financial condition or results of operations. Climate Change. There is a growingpolitical and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG)continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that areaffecting and are expected to continue affecting the global climate. Variousstakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders andnon-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectorsare considering ways to reduce GHG emissions. There is growing consensus thatsome form of regulation will be forthcoming at the federal level with respectto greenhouse gas emissions and such regulation could result in the creation ofadditional costs in the form of taxes or emission allowances. The impact of anyfuture mandatory GHG legislative or regulatory requirements on the Companysbusinesses and products is dependent on the design of the mandate, and so theCompany is unable to predict its significance at this time. Furthermore,the potential physical impacts of climate change on the Companys customers,and therefore on the Companys operations, are highly uncertain, and will beparticular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions.These may include changes in weather patterns (including drought and rainfalllevels), water availability, storm patterns and intensities, and temperaturelevels. These potential physical effects may adversely impact the cost, productionand financial performance of John Deeres operations. The risks identified above should beconsidered in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis beginningon page 15 and, specifically, the other risks described in the Safe HarborStatement on pages 17 and 18. The Companys results of operations may beaffected by these identified risks and/or by risks not currently contemplated. "
