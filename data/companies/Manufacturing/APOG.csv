12,APOG,APOGEE ENTERPRISES INC,2023-04-21,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSOur business faces many risks. Any of the risks discussed below, or elsewhere in this Form 10-K or our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Market and Industry RisksNorth American and global economic and industry-related business conditions materially affect our sales and results of operationsOur Architectural Framing Systems, Architectural Services and Architectural Glass segments are influenced by North American economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the North American commercial construction industry. The commercial construction industry is impacted by macroeconomic trends, such as availability of credit, employment levels, consumer confidence, interest rates and commodity prices. In addition, changes in architectural design trends, demographic trends, and/or remote work trends could impact demand for our products. To the extent changes in these factors negatively impact the overall commercial construction industry, our revenue and profits could be significantly reduced. Our LSO segment primarily depends on the strength of the retail custom picture framing industry. This industry is dependent on consumer confidence and the conditions of the U.S. economy. A decline in consumer confidence, whether as a result of an economic slowdown, uncertainty regarding the future or other factors, could result in a decrease in net sales and operating income of this segment.Global instability and uncertainty arising from events outside of our control, such as significant natural disasters, political crises, public health crises and pandemics, and/or other catastrophic events could materially affect our results of operationsNatural disasters, political crises, public health crises, and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control, may negatively impact our facilities or the facilities of third parties on which we depend, have broader adverse impacts on the commercial construction market, consumer confidence and spending, and/or impact both the well-being of our employees and our ability to operate our facilities. These types of disruptions or other events outside of our control could affect our business negatively, cause delays or cancellation of commercial construction projects or cause us to temporarily close our facilities, harming our operating results. In addition, if any of our facilities, including our manufacturing, finishing or distribution facilities, or the facilities of our suppliers, third-party service providers, or customers, is affected by natural disasters, political crises, public health crises, or other catastrophic events or events outside of our control, our business and operating results could suffer. New competitors or specific actions of our existing competitors could materially harm our businessWe operate in competitive industries in which the actions of our existing competitors or new competitors could result in loss of customers and/or market share. Changes in our competitors' products, prices or services could negatively impact our share of demand, net sales or margins.If foreign imports occur at increased levels for extended periods of time, our net sales and margins in those segments could be negatively impacted. Our LSO segment competes with several international specialty glass manufacturers and international and domestic acrylic suppliers. If these competitors are able to successfully improve their product attributes, service capabilities and production capacity and/or increase their sales and marketing focus in the U.S. custom picture framing market, this segment's net sales and margins could be negatively impacted. Our customer dependence in the LSO segment creates a significant risk of reduced demand for our productsThe LSO segment is highly dependent on a relatively small number of customers for its sales, while working to grow in new markets and with new customers. Accordingly, loss of a significant customer, a significant reduction in pricing, or a shift to a less favorable mix of value-added picture framing glass or acrylic products for one or more of those customers could materially reduce LSO net sales and operating results.  Strategic RisksWe could be unable to effectively manage and implement our enterprise strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our strategy includes differentiating our product and service offerings, shifting our business mix toward higher operating margins and return on invested capital performance, and moving away from our historical, decentralized operating model. Execution of this strategy will require additional investments of time and resources and could fail to achieve the desired results. For example, we may be unable to increase our sales and earnings by differentiating our product and service offerings in a cost-effective manner.  We may fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences, and thus focus on the wrong business mix. Our centralized operating system may not produce the desired operating efficiencies.11Table of ContentsRisks related to acquisitions and integration activities could adversely affect our operating resultsWe may complete acquisitions in the future as part of the execution of our strategic roadmap, including new geographies, adjacent market sectors and new product introductions. There are risks inherent in completing acquisitions, including:•diversion of management’s attention from existing business activities;•difficulties or delays in integrating and assimilating information and financial systems, operations and products of an acquired business or other business venture or in realizing projected efficiencies, growth prospects, cost savings and synergies;•potential loss of key employees, customers and suppliers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on relationships with existing customers and suppliers;•adverse impact on overall profitability if the acquired business does not achieve the return on investment projected at the time of acquisition; and•with respect to the acquired assets and liabilities, inaccurate assessment of additional post-acquisition capital investments; undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities; problems executing backlog of material supply or installation projects; unanticipated costs; and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs.If one or more of these risks were to arise in a material manner, our operating results could be negatively impacted. Operational RisksIf we are not able effectively to utilize and manage our manufacturing capacity, our results of operations will be negatively affectedNear-term performance depends, to a significant degree, on our ability to provide sufficient available capacity and appropriately utilize existing production capacity. The failure to successfully maintain existing capacity, or manage unanticipated interruptions in production, successfully implement planned capacity expansions, and/or make timely investments in additional physical capacity and supporting technology systems could adversely affect our operating results. Loss of key personnel and inability to source sufficient labor could adversely affect our operating resultsOur success depends on the skills of our leadership, construction project managers and other key technical personnel, and our ability to secure sufficient manufacturing and installation labor. In recent years, strong residential and commercial construction and low U.S. unemployment have caused increased competition for experienced construction project managers and other labor. If we are unable to retain existing employees, provide a safe and healthy working environment, and/or recruit and train additional employees with the requisite skills and experience, our operating results could be adversely impacted.Continuing inflation may negatively impact our profitability.Rising inflation, interest rates, and construction costs, or any one of them, could reduce the demand for our products and services and impact our profitability. Higher interest rates make it more expensive to finance construction projects, and as a result, may reduce the number of projects available to us and the demand for our products and services, and also increase the interest expenses associated with our borrowings.  Cost inflation, including significant cost increases for freight, aluminum, glass, paint and other materials used in our operations, has impacted, and could continue to impact, our profitability.  Furthermore, in some of our segments, we operate on contracts wherein we bear part or all of the risk of inflation on materials costs and the cost of installation services. Our ability to mitigate these costs, or recover the cost increases through price increases, may lag the cost increases, which could negatively impact our margins.If we are unable to manage our supply and distribution chains effectively our results of operations will be negatively affectedOur Architectural Framing Systems and Architectural Services segments use aluminum as a significant input to their products and our operating results in those two segments could be negatively impacted by supply chain disruptions and adverse price movements in the market for raw aluminum. In recent years, we have seen increased volatility in the price of aluminum that we purchase from both domestic and international sources. Due to our Architectural Framing Systems segment and Architectural Services segment presence in Canada, we have significant cross-border activity, as our Canadian businesses purchase inputs from U.S.-based suppliers and sell to U.S.-based customers.  A significant change in U.S. trade policy with Canada could, therefore, have an adverse impact on our net sales and operating results.Our Architectural Glass and LSO segments use raw glass as a significant input to their products. We periodically experience a tighter supply of raw glass when there is growth in automotive manufacturing and residential and non-residential construction. Failure to acquire a sufficient amount of raw glass on terms as favorable as current terms, including as a result of a significant unplanned downtime or shift in strategy at one or more of our key suppliers, could negatively impact our operating results.Our suppliers are subject to the fluctuations in general economic cycles. Global economic conditions may impact their ability to operate their businesses. They may also be impacted by the increasing costs or availability of raw materials, labor and distribution, resulting in demands for less attractive contract terms or an inability for them to meet our requirements or conduct their own businesses. The performance and financial condition of one or more suppliers may cause us to alter our business 12Table of Contentsterms or to cease doing business with a particular supplier or suppliers, or change our sourcing practices generally, which could in turn adversely affect our business and financial condition. If we encounter problems with distribution, our ability to deliver our products to market could be adversely affected. Our operations are vulnerable to interruptions in the event of work stoppages, whether due to public health concerns, labor disputes or shortages, and natural disasters that may affect our distribution and transportation to job sites. Moreover, our distribution system includes computer-controlled and automated equipment, which may be subject to a number of risks related to data and system security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. If we encounter problems with our distribution systems, our ability to meet customer and consumer expectations, manage inventory, manage transportation-related costs, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be adversely affected. Product quality issues and product liability claims could adversely affect our operating resultsWe manufacture and/or install a significant portion of our products based on the specific requirements of each customer. We believe that future orders of our products or services will depend on our ability to maintain the performance, reliability, quality and timely delivery standards required by our customers. We have in the past and are currently subject to product liability and warranty claims, including certain legal claims related to a commercial sealant product formerly incorporated into our products, and there is no certainty we will prevail on these claims.  If our products have performance, reliability or quality problems, or products are installed using incompatible glazing materials or installed improperly (by us or a customer), we may experience additional warranty and other expenses; reduced or canceled orders; higher manufacturing or installation costs; or delays in the collection of accounts receivable.  Additionally, product liability and warranty claims, including relating to the performance, reliability or quality of our products and services, could result in costly and time-consuming litigation that could require significant time and attention of management and involve significant monetary damages that could negatively impact our operating results. There is also no assurance that the number and value of product liability and warranty claims will not increase as compared to historical claim rates, or that our warranty reserve at any particular time is sufficient. No assurance can be given that coverage under insurance policies, if applicable, will be adequate to cover future product liability claims against us. If we are unable to recover on insurance claims, in whole or in part, or if we exhaust our available insurance coverage at some point in the future, then we might be forced to expend legal fees and settlement or judgment costs, which could negatively impact our profitability, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Project management and installation issues could adversely affect our operating resultsSome of our segments are awarded fixed-price contracts that include material supply and installation services. Often, bids are required before all aspects of a construction project are known. An underestimate in the amount of labor required and/or cost of materials for a project; a change in the timing of the delivery of product; system design errors; difficulties or errors in execution; or significant project delays, caused by us or other trades, could result in failure to achieve the expected results. Any one or more of such issues could result in losses on individual contracts that could negatively impact our operating results.Difficulties in maintaining our information technology systems, and potential cybersecurity threats, could negatively affect our operating results and/or our reputationOur operations are dependent upon various information technology systems that are used to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support our manufacturing operations and a variety of other business processes and activities, some of which are managed by third-parties. We could encounter difficulties in maintaining our existing systems, developing and implementing new systems or in our efforts to standardize enterprise resource planning and information technology systems across our business units. Such difficulties could lead to disruption in business operations and/or significant additional expenses that could adversely affect our results.Additionally, our information technology and Internet based systems, and those of our third-party service providers, are subject to cyber-attacks of increasing frequency and sophistication. These systems have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access, breach, damage, disrupt or otherwise compromise such systems, none of which have been material to us in the last three years to date. These cyber threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Should such an attack succeed, it could lead to the compromise of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data and product specifications, production downtimes, disruption in the availability of financial data, or misrepresentation of information via digital media. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our reputation and could result in litigation, loss of data and intellectual property, regulatory action, project delay claims, and increased costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection systems.Violations of legal and regulatory compliance requirements, including environmental laws, and changes in existing legal and regulatory requirements, may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.We are subject to a legal and regulatory framework imposed under federal and state laws and regulatory agencies, including 13Table of Contentslaws and regulations that apply specifically to U.S. public companies and laws and regulations applicable to our manufacturing and construction site operations. Our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and reporting standards, including climate-related regulations, may increase our general and administrative expenses, divert management time and attention, or limit our operational flexibility, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations. Additionally, new laws, rules, and regulations, or changes to existing laws or their interpretations, could create added legal and compliance costs and uncertainty for us. We use hazardous materials in our manufacturing operations, and have air and water emissions that require controls. Accordingly, we are also subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the storage and use of hazardous materials and disposal of wastes. A violation of such laws and regulations, or a release of such substances, may expose us to various claims, including claims by third parties, as well as remediation costs and fines.Financial RisksWe are self-insured for certain costs associated with our operations and an increase in our insurance claims and expenses may have a material negative impact on our operating resultsWe obtain third-party insurance to provide coverage for potential risk in areas such as employment practices, workers' compensation, directors and officers, automobile, engineer's errors and omissions, product rework and general liability, as well as medical insurance and various other coverages. However, we retain a high amount of risk on a self-insured basis through our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, in particular for product liability, medical and workers’ compensation claims. Therefore, a significant increase in the number or size of these claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Foreign currency effects could negatively affect our sales and operating incomeWhen the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, imports of products into the U.S. produced by international competitors become more price competitive and exports of our U.S.-fabricated products become less price competitive. If we are not able to counteract these types of price pressures through superior quality, service and prudent hedging programs, our net sales and operating income could be negatively impacted. Additionally, our international subsidiaries report their results of operations and financial position in their relevant functional currencies (local country currency), which are then translated into U.S. dollars. As the relationship between these currencies and the U.S. dollar changes, there could be a negative impact on our reported results and financial position.Results can differ significantly from our expectations and the expectations of analysts, which could have an adverse affect on the market price of our common stockOur sales and earnings guidance and resulting external analyst estimates are largely based on our view of our business and the broader commercial construction market. Further, there may be additional risk in our ability to accurately forecast our operational and financial performance and provide earnings guidance as a result of evolving conditions resulting from public health crises, economic downturns, and continued inflationary cost increases. Failure to meet our guidance or analyst expectations for net sales and earnings could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. We may experience further impairment of our goodwill, indefinite- and finite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets, in the future, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operationsOur assets include a significant amount of goodwill, indefinite- and finite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets. We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. We evaluate finite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of impairment involves significant judgment and projections about future performance. Based on our annual impairment valuation analysis performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, there was no impairment of goodwill or indefinite and finite-lived intangibles identified.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, based on the finalization of our plans for integrating the Sotawall business into the Architectural Services segment, beginning in fiscal 2023, we determined impairment of indefinite and finite-lived intangibles related to the Sotawall business and we recorded intangible impairment expense of $49.5 million. With the realignment of the Sotawall business from the Architectural Framing Systems segment into the Architectural Services segment  at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the historical comparative segment results for these two segments has been recast and as such this impairment expense recorded during fiscal 2022 is now reflected in the Architectural Services segment. Refer to additional information included within Notes 1 and 6 to the Financial Statements contained in Item 8 within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The discounted cash flow projections and revenue projections used in these analyses are dependent upon achieving forecasted levels of revenue and profitability. If revenue or profitability were to fall below forecasted levels, or if market conditions were 14Table of Contentsto decline in a material or sustained manner, further impairment could be indicated and we could incur an additional non-cash impairment expense that would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to timely and accurately report financial results and comply with our reporting obligations, which could materially affect our business. Regardless of how internal financial reporting control systems are designed, implemented, and enforced, they cannot ensure with absolute certainty that our policy objectives will be met in every instance. Because of the inherent limitations of all such systems, our internal controls over financial reporting may not always prevent or detect misstatements. Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our ability to accurately and timely report financial results, to prevent or detect fraud, or to comply with the requirements of the SEC or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which could necessitate a restatement of our financial statements, and/or result in an investigation, or the imposition of sanctions, by regulators. Such failure could additionally expose us to litigation and/or reputational harm, impair our ability to obtain financing, or increase the cost of any financing we obtain. All of these impacts could adversely affect the price of our common stock and our business overall"
5,APOG,APOGEE ENTERPRISES INC,2022-04-22,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSOur business faces many risks. Any of the risks discussed below, or elsewhere in this Form 10-K or our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.COVID-19 Pandemic RisksThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, efforts to mitigate the pandemic, and the related weakening economic conditions, have impacted our business and could have a significant negative impact on our operations, liquidity, financial condition and financial resultsTo date, we have experienced delays in commercial construction projects and other adverse consequences due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Quarantines and ""stay in place"" orders, the timing and length of containment and eradication solutions, travel restrictions, construction site closures and project delays, absenteeism by infected workers, labor shortages and other disruptions to our supply chain or to our customers, have adversely impacted our sales and operating results. In addition, the pandemic contributed to an economic downturn that has impacted demand for certain of our products and services. Order lead times have been, and may continue to be, extended or delayed. Within the LSO segment, we also experienced the temporary closure of many of our customer's retail locations. We also were required temporarily to shut down our factories in this segment to comply with government ""stay in place"" orders. We expect this global pandemic to continue to have an impact on our future revenue and results of operations, although the negative impacts on our business directly due to the COVID-19 pandemic had moderated by the end of fiscal 2022. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue to impact our businesses in the future will depend on numerous evolving factors including, but not limited to, the emergence of new variants of the coronavirus, such as the Delta and Omicron variants, and the effectiveness of ongoing public health initiatives, which have been boosted by vaccine production and distribution.9Table of ContentsMarket and Industry RisksNorth American and global economic and industry-related business conditions materially affect our sales and results of operationsOur Architectural Framing Systems, Architectural Glass and Architectural Services segments are significantly influenced by North American economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the North American commercial construction industry. The commercial construction industry is impacted by macroeconomic trends, such as availability of credit, employment levels, consumer confidence, interest rates and commodity prices. In addition, changes in architectural design trends, demographic trends, and/or remote work trends could negatively impact demand for our products. To the extent changes in these factors negatively impact the overall commercial construction industry, our revenue and profits could be significantly reduced. Our LSO segment primarily depends on the strength of the retail custom picture framing industry. This industry is dependent on consumer confidence and the conditions of the U.S. economy. A decline in consumer confidence, whether as a result of an economic slowdown (due to COVID-19 concerns discussed above or otherwise), uncertainty regarding the future or other factors, could result in a decrease in net sales and operating income of this segment.Global instability and uncertainty arising from events outside of our control, such as significant natural disasters, political crises, public health crises and pandemics, and/or other catastrophic events could materially affect our results of operationsNatural disasters, political crises, public health crises, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine, may negatively impact our facilities or the facilities of third parties on which we depend, have broader adverse impacts on the commercial construction market, consumer confidence and spending, and/or impact both the well-being of our employees and our ability to operate our facilities. These types of disruptions or other events outside of our control could affect our business negatively, cause delays or cancellation of commercial construction projects or cause us to temporarily close our facilities, harming our operating results. In addition, if any of our facilities, including our manufacturing, finishing or distribution facilities, or the facilities of our suppliers, third-party service providers, or customers, is affected by natural disasters, political crises, public health crises, or other catastrophic events or events outside of our control, our business and operating results could suffer. New competitors or specific actions of our existing competitors could materially harm our businessWe operate in competitive industries in which the actions of our existing competitors or new competitors could result in loss of customers and/or market share. Changes in our competitors' products, prices or services could negatively impact our share of demand, net sales or margins.Our Architectural Framing Systems and Architectural Glass segments have seen an increase in imports of products into the U.S. from international suppliers due to the relative strength of the U.S. dollar. If foreign imports occur at increased levels for extended periods of time, our net sales and margins in those segments could be negatively impacted. Our LSO segment competes with several international specialty glass manufacturers and international and domestic acrylic suppliers. If these competitors are able to successfully improve their product attributes, service capabilities and production capacity and/or increase their sales and marketing focus in the U.S. custom picture framing market, this segment's net sales and margins could be negatively impacted. Our customer dependence in the LSO segment creates a significant risk of reduced demand for our productsThe LSO segment is highly dependent on a relatively small number of customers for its sales, while working to grow in new markets and with new customers. Accordingly, loss of a significant customer, a significant reduction in pricing, or a shift to a less favorable mix of value-added picture framing glass or acrylic products for one or more of those customers could materially reduce LSO net sales and operating results.  Strategic RisksWe could be unable to effectively manage and implement our new enterprise strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our growth strategy includes differentiating our product and service offerings, shifting our business mix toward higher operating margins and return on invested capital performance, and shifting away from our historical, decentralized operating model. Execution of this strategy will require additional investments of time and resources and could fail to achieve the desired results. For example, we may be unable to increase our sales and earnings by differentiating our product and service offerings in a cost-effective manner.  We may fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences, and thus focus on the wrong business mix. Our centralized operating system may not produce the desired operating efficiencies.Risks related to acquisitions and integration activities could adversely affect our operating resultsWe have completed and may complete additional acquisitions in the future to accelerate the execution of our growth strategies, including new geographies, adjacent market sectors and new product introductions. There are risks inherent in completing acquisitions, including:10Table of Contents•diversion of management’s attention from existing business activities;•difficulties or delays in integrating and assimilating information and financial systems, operations and products of an acquired business or other business venture or in realizing projected efficiencies, growth prospects, cost savings and synergies;•potential loss of key employees, customers and suppliers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on relationships with existing customers and suppliers;•adverse impact on overall profitability if the acquired business does not achieve the return on investment projected at the time of acquisition; and•with respect to the acquired assets and liabilities, inaccurate assessment of additional post-acquisition capital investments; undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities; problems executing backlog of material supply or installation projects; unanticipated costs; and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs.If one or more of these risks were to arise in a material manner, our operating results could be negatively impacted. Operational RisksIf we are not able effectively to utilize and manage our manufacturing capacity, our results of operations will be negatively affectedNear-term performance depends, to a significant degree, on our ability to provide sufficient available capacity and appropriately utilize existing production capacity. The failure to successfully maintain existing capacity, or manage unanticipated interruptions in production, successfully implement planned capacity expansions, and/or make timely investments in additional physical capacity and supporting technology systems could adversely affect our operating results. Loss of key personnel and inability to source sufficient labor could adversely affect our operating resultsOur success depends on the skills of the Company's leadership, construction project managers and other key technical personnel, and our ability to secure sufficient manufacturing and installation labor. In recent years, strong residential and commercial construction and low U.S. unemployment have caused increased competition for experienced construction project managers and other labor. If we are unable to retain existing employees, provide a safe and healthy working environment, and/or recruit and train additional employees with the requisite skills and experience, our operating results could be adversely impacted.Continuing inflation may negatively impact our profitability.Rising inflation, interest rates, or construction costs could reduce the demand for our products and services and impact our profitability. Higher interest rates may make it more expensive to finance construction projects, and as a result, reduce the number of projects and the demand for our products and services.  Cost inflation, including significant cost increases for freight, aluminum, glass, paint and other materials used in our operations, has impacted, and could continue to impact, our profitability. The availability and price of necessary raw materials for our products may be negatively impacted by the international sanctions and market volatility caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Continued supply and demand imbalances for these resources may continue to exert upward pressure on costs.  Furthermore, in some of our segments, we operate on contracts wherein we bear part or all of the risk of inflation on materials costs and the cost of installation services. Our ability to mitigate these costs, or recover the cost increases through price increases, may continue to lag the cost increases, which could negatively impact our margins.If we are unable to manage our supply and distribution chains effectively our results of operations will be negatively affectedOur Architectural Framing Systems and Architectural Services segments use aluminum as a significant input to their products and our operating results in those two segments could be negatively impacted by supply chain disruptions and adverse price movements in the market for raw aluminum. In recent years, we have seen increased volatility in the price of aluminum that we purchase from both domestic and international sources. Due to our Architectural Framing Systems segment presence in Canada, we have significant cross-border activity, as our Canadian businesses purchase inputs from U.S.-based suppliers and sell to U.S.-based customers.  A significant change in U.S. trade policy with Canada could, therefore, have an adverse impact on our net sales and operating results.Our Architectural Glass and LSO segments use raw glass as a significant input to their products. We periodically experience a tighter supply of raw glass when there is growth in automotive manufacturing and residential and non-residential construction. Failure to acquire a sufficient amount of raw glass on terms as favorable as current terms, including as a result of a significant unplanned downtime or shift in strategy at one or more of our key suppliers, could negatively impact our operating results.Our suppliers are subject to the fluctuations in general economic cycles. Global economic conditions may impact their ability to operate their businesses, including recent impacts from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. They may also be impacted by the increasing costs or availability of raw materials, labor and distribution, resulting in demands for less attractive contract terms or an inability for them to meet our requirements or conduct their own businesses. The performance and financial condition of one 11Table of Contentsor more suppliers may cause us to alter our business terms or to cease doing business with a particular supplier or suppliers, or change our sourcing practices generally, which could in turn adversely affect our business and financial condition. If we encounter problems with distribution, our ability to deliver our products to market could be adversely affected. Our operations are vulnerable to interruptions in the event of work stoppages, whether due to health concerns, such as COVID-19 or otherwise, labor disputes or shortages, and natural disasters that may affect our distribution and transportation to job sites. Moreover, our distribution system includes computer-controlled and automated equipment, which may be subject to a number of risks related to data and system security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. If we encounter problems with our distribution systems, our ability to meet customer and consumer expectations, manage inventory, manage transportation-related costs, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be adversely affected. Product quality issues and product liability claims could adversely affect our operating resultsWe manufacture and/or install a significant portion of our products based on the specific requirements of each customer. We believe that future orders of our products or services will depend on our ability to maintain the performance, reliability, quality and timely delivery standards required by our customers. We have in the past and are currently subject to product liability and warranty claims, including certain legal claims related to a commercial sealant product formerly incorporated into our products, and there is no certainty we will prevail on these claims.  If our products have performance, reliability or quality problems, or products are installed using incompatible glazing materials or installed improperly (by us or a customer), we may experience additional warranty and other expenses; reduced or canceled orders; higher manufacturing or installation costs; or delays in the collection of accounts receivable.  Additionally, product liability and warranty claims, including relating to the performance, reliability or quality of our products and services, could result in costly and time-consuming litigation that could require significant time and attention of management and involve significant monetary damages that could negatively impact our operating results. There is also no assurance that the number and value of product liability and warranty claims will not increase as compared to historical claim rates, or that our warranty reserve at any particular time is sufficient. No assurance can be given that coverage under insurance policies, if applicable, will be adequate to cover future product liability claims against us. If we are unable to recover on insurance claims, in whole or in part, or if we exhaust our available insurance coverage at some point in the future, then we might be forced to expend legal fees and settlement or judgment costs, which could negatively impact our profitability, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Project management and installation issues could adversely affect our operating resultsSome of our segments are awarded fixed-price contracts that include material supply and installation services. Often, bids are required before all aspects of a construction project are known. An underestimate in the amount of labor required and/or cost of materials for a project; a change in the timing of the delivery of product; system design errors; difficulties or errors in execution; or significant project delays, caused by us or other trades, could result in failure to achieve the expected results. Any one or more of such issues could result in losses on individual contracts that could negatively impact our operating results.Difficulties in maintaining our information technology systems, and potential cybersecurity threats, could negatively affect our operating results and/or our reputationOur operations are dependent upon various information technology systems that are used to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support our manufacturing operations and a variety of other business processes and activities, some of which are managed by third-parties. We could encounter difficulties in maintaining our existing systems, developing and implementing new systems or in our efforts to standardize information technology systems across our business units.  Such difficulties could lead to disruption in business operations and/or significant additional expenses that could adversely affect our results. Additionally, our information technology and Internet based systems, and those of our third-party service providers, are subject to cyber-attacks of increasing frequency and sophistication. These systems have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access, breach, damage, disrupt or otherwise compromise such systems, none of which have been material to us to date. These cyber threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Should such an attack succeed, it could lead to the compromise of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data and product specifications, production downtimes, disruption in the availability of financial data, or misrepresentation of information via digital media. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our reputation and could result in litigation, loss of data and intellectual property, regulatory action, project delay claims, and increased costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection systems.Violations of legal and regulatory compliance requirements, including environmental laws, and changes in existing legal and regulatory requirements, may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.We are subject to a legal and regulatory framework imposed under federal and state laws and regulatory agencies, including 12Table of Contentslaws and regulations that apply specifically to U.S. public companies and laws and regulations applicable to our manufacturing and construction site operations.  Our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and reporting standards may increase our general and administrative expenses, divert management time and attention, or limit our operational flexibility, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations. Additionally, new laws, rules, and regulations, or changes to existing laws or their interpretations, could create added legal and compliance costs and uncertainty for us. We use hazardous materials in our manufacturing operations, and have air and water emissions that require controls. Accordingly, we are also subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the storage and use of hazardous materials and disposal of wastes. A violation of such laws and regulations, or a release of such substances, may expose us to various claims, including claims by third parties, as well as remediation costs and fines.Financial RisksWe are self-insured for certain costs associated with our operations and an increase in our insurance claims and expenses may have a material negative impact on our operating resultsWe obtain third-party insurance to provide coverage for potential risk in areas such as employment practices, workers' compensation, directors and officers, automobile, engineer's errors and omissions, product rework and general liability, as well as medical insurance and various other coverages. However, we retain a high amount of risk on a self-insured basis through our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, in particular for product liability, medical and workers’ compensation claims. Therefore, a significant increase in the number or size of these claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Foreign currency effects could negatively affect our sales and operating incomeWhen the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, imports of products into the U.S. produced by international competitors become more price competitive and exports of our U.S.-fabricated products become less price competitive. If we are not able to counteract these types of price pressures through superior quality, service and prudent hedging programs, our net sales and operating income could be negatively impacted. Additionally, our international subsidiaries report their results of operations and financial position in their relevant functional currencies (local country currency), which are then translated into U.S. dollars. As the relationship between these currencies and the U.S. dollar changes, there could be a negative impact on our reported results and financial position.Results can differ significantly from our expectations and the expectations of analysts, which could have an adverse affect on the market price of our common stockOur sales and earnings guidance and resulting external analyst estimates are largely based on our view of our business and the broader commercial construction market. Further, there is additional risk in our ability to accurately forecast our operational and financial performance and provide earnings guidance as a result of evolving conditions because of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic downturn, continued inflationary cost increases and uncertainty resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Failure to meet our guidance or analyst expectations for net sales and earnings would have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. We may experience further impairment of our goodwill, indefinite- and finite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets, in the future, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operationsOur assets include a significant amount of goodwill, indefinite- and finite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets. We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. We evaluate finite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of impairment involves significant judgment and projections about future performance. Based on our annual impairment valuation analysis performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, there was no goodwill impairment identified.  During fiscal 2021, our annual impairment analysis determined impairment of goodwill at two of our reporting units within the Architectural Framing Systems segment and we determined impairment of our EFCO trade name. As a result, in the prior year, we recorded a goodwill impairment expense and an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment expense of $63.8 million and $6.3 million, respectively. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, based on the finalization of our plans for integrating the Sotawall business into the Architectural Services segment, beginning in fiscal 2023, we determined impairment of indefinite and finite-lived intangibles within the Architectural Framing Systems segment and we recorded intangible impairment expense of $49.5 million. Refer to additional information included within Notes 1 and 6 to the Financial Statements contained in Item 8 within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.13Table of ContentsThe discounted cash flow projections and revenue projections used in these analyses are dependent upon achieving forecasted levels of revenue and profitability. If revenue or profitability were to fall below forecasted levels, or if market conditions were to decline in a material or sustained manner, further impairment could be indicated and we could incur an additional non-cash impairment expense that would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations"
14,APOG,APOGEE ENTERPRISES INC,2021-04-22,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSOur business faces many risks. Any of the risks discussed below, or elsewhere in this Form 10-K or our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.COVID-19 Pandemic RisksThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, efforts to mitigate the pandemic, and the related weakening economic conditions, have impacted our business and could have a significant negative impact on our operations, liquidity, financial condition and financial resultsIn early 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, started to impact the global economic environment causing extreme volatility and uncertainty in global markets. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic and we started to see certain impacts to our business. This contagious disease outbreak, which has continued to spread, and the related adverse public health developments, and government orders to ""stay in place,"" have adversely affected work forces, economies and financial markets globally. Quarantines and ""stay in place"" orders, the timing and length of containment and eradication solutions, travel restrictions, absenteeism by infected workers, labor shortages or other disruptions to our supply chain or to our customers, have adversely impacted our sales and operating results and have resulted in some continued project delays. In addition, the pandemic contributed to an economic downturn that could affect the ability of our customers to obtain financing for projects, which could therefore impact demand for our products and services. Order lead times could be extended or delayed and our pricing or pricing by our suppliers for needed materials could increase. Some critical materials, products or services may become unavailable if the regional or global spread were significant enough to prevent alternative sourcing. To date, we have experienced delays in commercial construction projects due to COVID-19. While the construction and construction-related industries are considered an ""essential service"" in most jurisdictions in which we operate, site closures or project delays have occurred and increased social distancing and health-related precautions are required on many work sites, which may cause additional project delays and additional costs to be incurred. Within the LSO segment, we also experienced the temporary closure of many of our customer's retail locations. We also were required temporarily to shut down our factories in this segment to comply with government ""stay in place"" orders. We expect this global pandemic to continue to have an impact on our future revenue and results of operations, the size and duration of which we are currently unable to predict. The global outbreak of COVID-19 continues to evolve rapidly. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate severity and spread of the disease, the intensity and duration of outbreaks, travel restrictions and social distancing requirements in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions, and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain, treat and eradicate the disease.Given the speed and frequency of continuously evolving developments with respect to this pandemic, we cannot reasonably estimate the magnitude of the impact to our future results of operations, liquidity or financial position. To the extent that our customers and suppliers are adversely impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, this could reduce the availability, or result in delays, of materials or supplies, or delays in customer payments, which in turn could materially interrupt our business operations and/or impact our results of operations and liquidity.Market and Industry RisksNorth American and global economic and industry-related business conditions materially affect our sales and results of operationsOur Architectural Framing Systems, Architectural Glass and Architectural Services segments are significantly influenced by North American economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the North American commercial construction industry. The commercial construction industry is impacted by macroeconomic trends, such as availability of credit, employment levels, consumer confidence, interest rates and commodity prices. In addition, changes in architectural design trends, demographic trends, and/or remote work trends could negatively impact demand for our products. To the extent changes in these factors negatively impact the overall commercial construction industry, our revenue and profits could be significantly reduced. 10Table of ContentsOur LSO segment primarily depends on the strength of the retail custom picture framing industry. This industry is dependent on consumer confidence and the conditions of the U.S. economy. A decline in consumer confidence, whether as a result of an economic slowdown (due to COVID-19 concerns discussed above or otherwise), uncertainty regarding the future or other factors, could result in a decrease in net sales and operating income of this segment.Global instability and uncertainty arising from events outside of our control, such as significant natural disasters, political crises, public health crises and pandemics, and/or other catastrophic events could materially affect our results of operationsNatural disasters, political crises, public health crises, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may damage our facilities or the facilities of third parties on which we depend, have broader adverse impacts on the commercial construction market, consumer confidence and spending, and/or impact both the well-being of our employees and our ability to operate our facilities. These types of disruptions or other events outside of our control could affect our business negatively, cause delays or cancellation of commercial construction projects or cause us to temporarily close our facilities, harming our operating results. In addition, if any of our facilities, including our manufacturing, finishing or distribution facilities, or the facilities of our suppliers, third-party service providers, or customers, is affected by natural disasters, political crises, public health crises, or other catastrophic events or events outside of our control, our business and operating results could suffer. New competitors or specific actions of our existing competitors could materially harm our businessWe operate in competitive industries in which the actions of our existing competitors or new competitors could result in loss of customers and/or market share. Changes in our competitors' products, prices or services could negatively impact our share of demand, net sales or margins.Our Architectural Framing Systems and Architectural Glass segments have seen an increase in imports of products into the U.S. from international suppliers due to the relative strength of the U.S. dollar. If foreign imports occur at increased levels for extended periods of time, our net sales and margins in those segments could be negatively impacted. Our LSO segment competes with several international specialty glass manufacturers and international and domestic acrylic suppliers. If these competitors are able to successfully improve their product attributes, service capabilities and production capacity and/or increase their sales and marketing focus in the U.S. custom picture framing market, this segment's net sales and margins could be negatively impacted. Our customer dependence in the LSO segment creates a significant risk of reduced demand for our productsThe LSO segment is highly dependent on a relatively small number of customers for its sales, while working to grow in new markets and with new customers. Accordingly, loss of a significant customer, a significant reduction in pricing, or a shift to a less favorable mix of value-added picture framing glass or acrylic products for one or more of those customers could materially reduce LSO net sales and operating results. Many customers in this segment temporarily closed retail outlets, during a portion of fiscal 2021, as a result of ""stay in place"" orders within the United States, resulting in reduced demand for our product. We are unable to estimate the severity or longer-term impact resulting from this COVID-19 pandemic on our business in this segment. Operational RisksIf we are not able effectively to utilize and manage our manufacturing capacity, our results of operations will be negatively affectedNear-term performance depends, to a significant degree, on our ability to provide sufficient available capacity and appropriately utilize existing production capacity. The failure to successfully maintain existing capacity, or manage unanticipated interruptions in production, successfully implement planned capacity expansions, and/or make timely investments in additional physical capacity and supporting technology systems could adversely affect our operating results. Loss of key personnel and inability to source sufficient labor could adversely affect our operating resultsOur success depends on the skills of the Company's leadership, construction project managers and other key technical personnel, and our ability to secure sufficient manufacturing and installation labor. In recent years, strong residential and commercial construction and low U.S. unemployment has caused increased competition for experienced construction project managers and other labor. If we are unable to retain existing employees, provide a safe and healthy working environment, and/or recruit and train additional employees with the requisite skills and experience, our operating results could be adversely impacted.11Table of ContentsIf we are unable to manage our supply chain effectively, including availability and price of materials used in our products, our results of operations will be negatively affectedOur Architectural Framing Systems and Architectural Services segments use aluminum as a significant input to their products. While we structure many of our supply agreements in a way to moderate the effects of fluctuations in the market for raw aluminum and we endeavor to adjust our pricing to offset potential impacts, operating results could be negatively impacted by price movements in the market for raw aluminum. In recent years, we have seen increased volatility in the price of aluminum that we purchase from both domestic and international sources. Due to our Architectural Framing Systems segment presence in Canada, we have significant cross-border activity, as our Canadian businesses purchase inputs from U.S.-based suppliers and sell to U.S.-based customers.  A significant change in U.S. trade policy with Canada could, therefore, have an adverse impact on our net sales and operating results.Our Architectural Glass and LSO segments use raw glass as a significant input to their products. We periodically experience a tighter supply of raw glass when there is growth in automotive manufacturing and residential and non-residential construction. Failure to acquire a sufficient amount of raw glass on terms as favorable as current terms, including as a result of a significant unplanned downtime or shift in strategy at one or more of our key suppliers, could negatively impact our operating results.Our suppliers are subject to the fluctuations in general economic cycles. Global economic conditions may impact their ability to operate their businesses, including recent impacts from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. They may also be impacted by the increasing costs or availability of raw materials, labor and distribution, resulting in demands for less attractive contract terms or an inability for them to meet our requirements or conduct their own businesses. The performance and financial condition of one or more suppliers may cause us to alter our business terms or to cease doing business with a particular supplier or suppliers, or change our sourcing practices generally, which could in turn adversely affect our business and financial condition. If we encounter problems with distribution, our ability to deliver our products to market could be adversely affected. Our operations are vulnerable to interruptions in the event of work stoppages, whether due to health concerns, such as COVID-19 or otherwise, labor disputes or shortages, and natural disasters that may affect our distribution and transportation to job sites. Moreover, our distribution system includes computer-controlled and automated equipment, which may be subject to a number of risks related to data and system security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. If we encounter problems with our distribution systems, our ability to meet customer and consumer expectations, manage inventory, manage transportation-related costs, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be adversely affected. Product quality issues and product liability claims could adversely affect our operating resultsWe manufacture and/or install a significant portion of our products based on the specific requirements of each customer. We believe that future orders of our products or services will depend on our ability to maintain the performance, reliability, quality and timely delivery standards required by our customers. We have in the past and are currently subject to product liability and warranty claims, including certain legal claims related to a commercial sealant product formerly incorporated into our products.  If our products have performance, reliability or quality problems, or products are installed using incompatible glazing materials or installed improperly (by us or a customer), we may experience additional warranty expense; reduced or canceled orders; higher manufacturing or installation costs; or delays in the collection of accounts receivable.  Additionally, product liability and warranty claims, including relating to the performance, reliability or quality of our products and services, could result in costly and time-consuming litigation that could require significant time and attention of management and involve significant monetary damages that could negatively impact our operating results. There is also no assurance that the number and value of product liability and warranty claims will not increase as compared to historical claim rates, or that our warranty reserve at any particular time is sufficient. No assurance can be given that coverage under insurance policies, if applicable, will be adequate to cover future product liability claims against us. If we are unable to recover on an insurance claims, in whole or in part, or if we exhaust our available insurance coverage at some point in the future, then we might be forced to expend legal fees and settlement or judgment costs, which could negatively impact our profitability, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Project management and installation issues could adversely affect our operating resultsSome of our segments are awarded fixed-price contracts that include material supply and installation services. Often, bids are required before all aspects of a construction project are known. An underestimate in the amount of labor required and/or cost of materials for a project; a change in the timing of the delivery of product; system design errors; difficulties or errors in execution; or significant project delays, caused by us or other trades, could result in failure to achieve the expected results. Any one or more of such issues could result in losses on individual contracts that could negatively impact our operating results.12Table of ContentsRisks related to acquisitions and integration activities could adversely affect our operating resultsWe have completed and may complete additional acquisitions in the future to accelerate the execution of our growth strategies, including new geographies, adjacent market sectors and new product introductions. There are risks inherent in completing acquisitions, including:•diversion of management’s attention from existing business activities;•difficulties or delays in integrating and assimilating information and financial systems, operations and products of an acquired business or other business venture or in realizing projected efficiencies, growth prospects, cost savings and synergies;•potential loss of key employees, customers and suppliers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on relationships with existing customers and suppliers;•adverse impact on overall profitability if the acquired business does not achieve the return on investment projected at the time of acquisition; and•with respect to the acquired assets and liabilities, inaccurate assessment of additional post-acquisition capital investments; undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities; problems executing backlog of material supply or installation projects; unanticipated costs; and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs.If one or more of these risks were to arise in a material manner, our operating results could be negatively impacted.Difficulties in maintaining our information technology systems, and potential security threats, could negatively affect our operating results and/or our reputationOur operations are dependent upon various information technology systems that are used to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support our manufacturing operations and a variety of other business processes and activities. We could encounter difficulties in maintaining our existing systems, and developing and implementing new systems.  Such difficulties could lead to disruption in business operations and/or significant additional expenses that could adversely affect our results. Additionally, information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Our information technology and Internet based systems have been in the past, and may be in the future, subject to attempts to gain unauthorized access, breach, malfeasance or other system disruptions, none of which have been material to us to date. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Should such an attack succeed, it could lead to the compromise of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data and product specifications, production downtimes, disruption in the availability of financial data, or misrepresentation of information via digital media. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our reputation and could result in litigation, regulatory action, project delay claims, and increased costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection systems.Violations of legal and regulatory compliance requirements, including environmental laws, and changes in existing legal and regulatory requirements, may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.We are subject to a legal and regulatory framework imposed under federal and state laws and regulatory agencies, including laws and regulations that apply specifically to U.S. public companies and laws and regulations applicable to our manufacturing and construction site operations.  Our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and reporting standards may increase our general and administrative expenses, divert management time and attention, or limit our operational flexibility, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations. Additionally, new laws, rules, and regulations, or changes to existing laws or their interpretations, could create added legal and compliance costs and uncertainty for us. We use hazardous materials in our manufacturing operations, and have air and water emissions that require controls. Accordingly, we are also subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the storage and use of hazardous materials and disposal of wastes. A violation of such laws and regulations, or a release of such substances, may expose us to various claims, including claims by third parties, as well as remediation costs and fines.Financial RisksDue to our self-insurance programs, we may have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the event of a material product liability claimWe obtain third-party insurance to provide coverage for potential risk in areas such as employment practices, workers' compensation, directors and officers, automobile, architect's and engineer's errors and omissions, product rework and general liability, as well as medical insurance and various other coverages. However, we retain a high amount of risk on a self-insured basis, partially through our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary. Therefore, a material architectural product liability event could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. 13Table of ContentsForeign currency effects could negatively affect our sales and operating incomeWhen the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, imports of products into the U.S. produced by international competitors become more price competitive and exports of our U.S.-fabricated products become less price competitive. If we are not able to counteract these types of price pressures through superior quality and service, our net sales and operating income could be negatively impacted. Additionally, our international subsidiaries report their results of operations and financial position in their relevant functional currencies (local country currency), which are then translated into U.S. dollars. As the relationship between these currencies and the U.S. dollar changes, there could be a negative impact on our reported results and financial position.Results can differ significantly from our expectations and the expectations of analysts, which could have an adverse affect on the market price of our common stockOur sales and earnings guidance and resulting external analyst estimates are largely based on our view of our business and the broader commercial construction market. Further, there is additional risk in our ability to accurately forecast and provide guidance in the current environment, given the evolving conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic downturn. Failure to meet our guidance or analyst expectations for net sales and earnings would have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. We may experience further impairment of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, in the future, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operationsOur assets include a significant amount of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. The assessment of impairment involves significant judgment and projections about future performance. Based on our analysis performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we determined impairment of goodwill at two of our reporting units within the Architectural Framing Systems segment, EFCO and Sotawall, and we determined impairment of the EFCO tradename. As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment expense of $63.8 million and an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment expense of $6.3 million. Refer to additional information included within Notes 1 and 6 to the Financial Statements contained in Item 8 within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The discounted cash flow projections and revenue projections used in these analyses are dependent upon achieving forecasted levels of revenue and profitability.

Order lead times could be extended or delayed and our pricing or pricing of suppliers for needed materials could increase. Some critical materials, products or services may become unavailable if the regional or global spread were significant enough to prevent alternative sourcing. Accordingly, we are considering alternative product sourcing in the event that material supply becomes problematic. To date, we have experienced some delays in commercial construction projects due to COVID-19. While the construction and construction-related industries are considered an ""essential service"" in most jurisdictions in which we operate, site closures or project delays have occurred and increased social distancing and health-related precautions are required on many work sites, which may cause additional project delays and additional costs to be incurred.

North American and global economic and industry-related business conditionsOur Architectural Framing Systems, Architectural Glass and Architectural Services segments are dependent on North American economic conditions and the somewhat cyclical nature of the North American commercial construction industry. The commercial construction industry is impacted by macroeconomic trends such as availability of credit, employment levels, consumer confidence, interest rates and commodity prices. To the extent changes in these factors negatively impact the overall commercial construction industry, our revenue and profits could be significantly reduced. Our LSO segment primarily depends on the strength of the retail custom picture framing industry. This industry is highly dependent on consumer confidence and the conditions of the U.S. economy. A decline in consumer confidence, whether as a result of an economic slowdown (due to COVID-19 concerns discussed above or otherwise), uncertainty regarding the future or other factors, could result in a decrease in net sales and operating income of this segment.   Foreign currency impactsWhen the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, imports of products into the U.S. produced by international competitors become more price competitive and exports of our U.S.-fabricated products become less price competitive.

Changes in our competitors' products, prices or services could negatively impact our share of demand, net sales or margins.Our Architectural Framing Systems and Architectural Glass segments have seen an increase in imports of products into the U.S. from international suppliers due to the relative strength of the U.S. dollar. If foreign imports occur at increased levels for extended periods of time, our net sales and margins could be negatively impacted. Our LSO segment competes with several international specialty glass manufacturers and international and domestic acrylic suppliers. If these competitors are able to successfully increase their product attributes, service capabilities and production capacity and/or increase their sales and marketing focus in the U.S. custom picture framing market, this segment's net sales and margins could be negatively impacted. Acquisitions and related integration activities We have completed and may complete additional acquisitions in the future to accelerate the execution of our growth strategies, including new geographies, adjacent market sectors and new product introductions. There are risks inherent in completing acquisitions, including:•diversion of management’s attention from existing business activities;•difficulties or delays in integrating and assimilating information and financial systems, operations and products of an acquired business or other business venture or in realizing projected efficiencies, growth prospects, cost savings and synergies;•potential loss of key employees, customers and suppliers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on relationships with existing customers and suppliers;•adverse impact on overall profitability if the acquired business does not achieve the return on investment projected at the time of acquisition; and•with respect to the acquired assets and liabilities, inaccurate assessment of additional post-acquisition capital investments; undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities; problems executing backlog of material supply or installation projects; unanticipated costs; and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs.If one or more of these risks were to arise in a material manner, our operating results could be negatively impacted.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairmentOur assets include a significant amount of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually at our year-end, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. The assessment of impairment requires determination of estimated fair value, generally using a discounted cash flow analysis, which involves significant judgment and projections about future performance. Evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit in which goodwill is recorded using a qualitative or quantitative analysis. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by management on a regular basis. Each of our nine business units represents a reporting unit for the goodwill impairment analysis. Based on our analysis, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, impairment was not indicated. However, the estimated fair value did not exceed carrying value by a significant margin for two of our reporting units within the Architectural Framing Systems segment, Sotawall and Alumicor, which had goodwill balances of $21.0 million and $14.1 million, respectively, at February 29, 2020. We utilized a discount rate of 9.4 percent in determining the discounted cash flows in our fair value analysis and a long-term growth rate of 3.0 percent. If our discount rate were to increase by 20 basis points, the fair value of these reporting units would fall below carrying value, which would indicate impairment of the goodwill. Additionally, this discounted cash flow analysis is dependent upon achieving forecasted levels of revenue and profitability. If revenue or profitability were to fall below forecasted levels, or if market conditions were to decline in a material or sustained manner, impairment would be indicated at these reporting units, and potentially at our other reporting units. Subsequent to year-end, we have begun to see impacts from COVID-19 that will likely have a negative impact on our forecasted revenue and  profitability and this, along with the decline in our stock price and other market conditions, could result in an indication of impairment of goodwill in our first quarter of 2021.  Fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured using the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes the trade name or trademark has value to the extent that the owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from the asset. This method requires estimation of the future revenue from the related asset, the appropriate royalty rate, and the weighted average cost of capital. Based on our analysis, the estimated fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, impairment was not indicated. In determining the discounted future revenue in our fair value 10Table of Contentsanalysis, we assumed a discount rate of 9.4 percent, a royalty rate of 1.0 percent, and a long-term growth rate of 3.0 percent. If future revenue were to fall below forecasted levels or if market conditions were to decline in a material or sustained manner, due to COVID-19 or otherwise, we could incur a non-cash impairment charge that would negatively impact our net earnings for the fiscal period in which the charge was recorded. Effective utilization and management of our manufacturing capacity Near-term performance depends, to a significant degree, on our ability to provide sufficient available capacity and appropriately utilize existing production capacity. The failure to successfully maintain existing capacity, or manage unanticipated interruptions in production, successfully implement planned capacity expansions, and/or make timely investments in additional physical capacity and supporting technology systems could adversely affect our operating results. Loss of key personnel and inability to source sufficient laborOur success depends on the skills of the Company's leadership, construction project managers and other key technical personnel, and our ability to secure sufficient manufacturing and installation labor. In recent years, strong residential and commercial construction and low U.S. unemployment has caused increased competition for experienced construction project managers and other labor. If we are unable to retain existing employees, provide a safe and healthy working environment, and/or recruit and train additional employees with the requisite skills and experience, our operating results could be adversely impacted.Supply chain management, including availability and price of materials used in our productsOur Architectural Framing Systems and Architectural Services segments use aluminum as a significant input to their products. While we structure many of our supply agreements in a way to moderate the effects of fluctuations in the market for raw aluminum and we endeavor to adjust our pricing to offset potential impacts, operating results could be negatively impacted by price movements in the market for raw aluminum. In recent years, we have seen increased volatility in the price of aluminum that we purchase from both domestic and international sources. Due to our Architectural Framing Systems segment presence in Canada, we have significant cross-border activity, as our Canadian businesses purchase inputs from U.S.-based suppliers and sell to U.S.-based customers.  A significant change in U.S. trade policy with Canada could therefore have an adverse impact on our net sales and operating results.Our Architectural Glass and LSO segments use raw glass as a significant input to their products. We periodically experience a tighter supply of raw glass when there is growth in automotive manufacturing and residential and non-residential construction. Although we have secured supply commitments from multiple suppliers that allow us to reach our near-term growth targets, a significant unplanned downtime or shift in strategy at one or more of our key suppliers could negatively impact our operating results.Our suppliers are subject to the fluctuations in general economic cycles, and global economic conditions may impact their ability to operate their businesses, including recent impacts from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. They may also be impacted by the increasing costs or availability of raw materials, labor and distribution, resulting in demands for less attractive contract terms or an inability for them to meet our requirements or conduct their own businesses. The performance and financial condition of a supplier may cause us to alter our business terms or to cease doing business with a particular supplier, or change our sourcing practices generally, which could in turn adversely affect our business and financial condition. Further, the potential impact of COVID-19 could adversely impact our suppliers and result in our inability to purchase needed materials in a timely manner or to achieve our targeted procurement cost reductions.If we encounter problems with distribution, our ability to deliver our products to market could be adversely affected. Our operations are vulnerable to interruptions in the event of work stoppages, whether due to health concerns such as COVID-19 or otherwise, labor disputes or shortages and natural disasters that may affect our distribution and transportation to job sites. Moreover, our distribution system includes computer-controlled and automated equipment, which may be subject to a number of risks related to data and system security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. If we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to meet customer and consumer expectations, manage inventory, manage transportation-related costs, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be adversely affected. Product quality issuesWe manufacture and/or install a significant portion of our products based on the specific requirements of each customer. We believe that future orders of our products or services will depend on our ability to maintain the performance, reliability and quality standards required by our customers. If our products have performance, reliability or quality problems, or products are installed using incompatible glazing materials or installed improperly (by us or a customer), we may experience additional warranty expense; reduced or canceled orders; higher manufacturing or installation costs; or delays in the collection of accounts receivable. Additionally, performance, reliability or quality claims from our customers could result in costly and time-consuming litigation 11Table of Contentsthat could require significant time and attention of management and involve significant monetary damages that could negatively impact our operating results.Project management and installation issuesSome of our segments are awarded fixed-price contracts that include material supply and installation services. Often, bids are required before all aspects of a construction project are known. An underestimate in the amount of labor required and/or cost of materials for a project; a change in the timing of the delivery of product; system design errors; difficulties or errors in execution; or significant project delays, caused by us or other trades, could result in failure to achieve the expected results. Any one or more of such issues could result in losses on individual contracts that could negatively impact our operating results.Specifically, we have a large construction project that is nearing completion but continues to experience certain project delays that have resulted in significant additional costs and ongoing negotiations with our customer. These and any further delays or project difficulties could have additional negative impact on our operating results. Customer dependence in the LSO segmentThe LSO segment is highly dependent on a relatively small number of customers for its sales, while working to grow in new markets and with new customers. Accordingly, loss of a significant customer, a significant reduction in pricing, or a shift to a less favorable mix of value-added picture framing glass or acrylic products for one or more of those customers could materially reduce LSO net sales and operating results. Recently, many customers in this segment temporarily closed retail outlets as a result of ""stay in place"" orders within the United States, resulting in reduced demand for our product. In response to this changing retail environment, the LSO segment has temporarily reduced production and labor, and furloughed employees. We expect this situation to result in a significant reduction in sales in our first quarter of fiscal 2021, however, we are unable to estimate the severity or longer-term impact resulting from this COVID-19 pandemic on our business in this segment. If demand continues to remain depressed, it could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of this segment.Results can differ significantly from our expectations and the expectations of analystsOur sales and earnings guidance and resulting external analyst estimates are largely based on our view of our business and the broader commercial construction market. Further, there is additional risk in our ability to accurately forecast and provide guidance in the current environment, given the rapidly evolving conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Failure to meet our guidance or analyst expectations for net sales and earnings would have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. Significant risk retention through self-insurance programs We obtain third-party insurance to provide coverage for potential risk in areas such as employment practices, workers' compensation, directors and officers, automobile, architect's and engineer's errors and omissions, product rework and general liability, as well as medical insurance and various other coverages. However, a high amount of risk is retained on a self-insured basis, partially through our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary. Therefore, a material architectural product liability event could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Dependence on information technology systems and potential security threatsOur operations are dependent upon various information technology systems that are used to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support our manufacturing operations and a variety of other business processes and activities. We could encounter difficulties in maintaining our existing systems, and developing and implementing new systems.  Such difficulties could lead to disruption in business operations and/or significant additional expenses that could adversely affect our results. Additionally, information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Should such an attack succeed, it could lead to the compromise of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data and product specifications, production downtimes, disruption in the availability of financial data, or misrepresentation of information via digital media. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our reputation and could result in litigation, regulatory action, project delay claims, and increased costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection systems"

Any of the risks discussed below, or elsewhere in this Form 10-K or our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.North American economic and industry-related business conditionsOur Architectural Framing Systems, Architectural Glass and Architectural Services segments are dependent on North American economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the North American commercial construction industry. The commercial construction industry is impacted by macroeconomic trends that, in turn, affect, among other things, availability of credit, employment levels, consumer confidence, interest rates and commodity prices. To the extent changes in these factors negatively impact the overall commercial construction industry, our revenue and profits could be significantly reduced. Our LSO segment primarily depends on the strength of the retail custom picture framing industry. This industry is highly dependent on consumer confidence and the conditions of the U.S. economy. A decline in consumer confidence, whether as a result of an 8Table of Contentseconomic slowdown, uncertainty regarding the future or other factors, could result in a decrease in net sales and operating income of this segment.Foreign currency exchange impactsOur international subsidiaries report their results of operations and financial position in their relevant functional currencies (local country currency), which are then translated into U.S. dollars. This translated financial information is included in our consolidated financial statements. As the relationship between these currencies and the U.S. dollar changes, there could be a negative impact on our reported results and financial position.In addition, when the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, imports of products into the U.S. produced by international competitors become more price competitive and exports of our U.S.-fabricated products become less price competitive. If we are not able to counteract these types of price pressures through superior quality and service, our net sales and operating income could be negatively impacted. New competitors or specific actions of our existing competitorsAll of our operating segments operate in competitive industries where the actions of our existing competitors or new competitors could result in a loss of customers or share of customers' demand. Changes in our competitors' products, prices or services could negatively impact our share of demand, net sales or margins.Our Architectural Framing Systems and Architectural Glass segments have seen an increase in imports of competitive products into the U.S. from international suppliers due to the relative strength of the U.S. dollar. If imports of competitive products were to occur at increased levels for extended periods of time, our net sales and margins could be negatively impacted. Our LSO segment competes with several international specialty glass manufacturers and international and domestic acrylic suppliers. If these competitors are able to successfully increase their product attributes, service capabilities and production capacity and/or increase their sales and marketing focus in the U.S. custom picture framing market, this segment's net sales and margins could be negatively impacted. Acquisitions and related integration activities We have completed and may complete additional acquisitions in the future to accelerate the execution of our growth strategies, including new geographies, adjacent market sectors and new product introductions. While we have a disciplined approach to assessing potential acquisition targets, conducting due diligence activities, negotiating appropriate acquisition terms and integration activities, there are risks inherent in completing acquisitions, including:•diversion of management’s attention from existing business activities;•difficulties or delays in integrating and assimilating information and financial systems, operations and products of an acquired business or other business venture or in realizing projected efficiencies, growth prospects, cost savings and synergies;•potential loss of key employees, customers and suppliers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on relationships with existing customers and suppliers;•adverse impact on overall profitability if the acquired business does not achieve the return on investment projected at the time of acquisition; and•with respect to the acquired assets and liabilities, inaccurate assessment of additional post-acquisition capital investments; undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities; problems executing backlog of material supply or installation projects; unanticipated costs; and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs.If one or more of these risks were to arise in a material manner, our operating results could be negatively impacted.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairmentOur total assets include a significant amount of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the potential for impairment. If future operating performance at one or more of our operating units were to fall significantly below forecast levels or if market conditions for one or more of our acquired businesses were to decline in a material and sustained manner, we could incur a non-cash impairment charge that would negatively impact our net earnings for the fiscal period in which the charge was recorded. Effective utilization and management of our manufacturing capacity Near-term performance depends, to a significant degree, on our ability to provide sufficient available capacity and appropriately utilize existing production capacity. The failure to successfully maintain existing capacity, successfully implement planned capacity expansions, and/or make timely investments in additional physical capacity could adversely affect our operating results. 9Table of ContentsLoss of key personnel and inability to source sufficient laborOur success depends on the skills of the Company's leadership, construction project managers and other key technical personnel, and our ability to secure sufficient manufacturing and installation labor. Increased activity in residential and commercial construction has caused increased competition for experienced construction project managers. Additionally, some of our manufacturing facilities are located in regions that at times have experienced low levels of unemployment. If we are unable to retain existing employees and/or recruit and train additional employees with the requisite skills and experience, our operating results could be adversely impacted.Commodity price fluctuations, trade policy impacts and supply availabilityOur Architectural Framing Systems and Architectural Services segments use aluminum as a significant input to their products. While we structure many of our supply agreements in a way to moderate the effects of fluctuations in the market for raw aluminum and we endeavor to adjust our pricing to offset potential impacts, operating results could be negatively impacted by price movements in the market for raw aluminum.

Any one or more of such issues could result in losses on individual contracts that could negatively impact our operating results.Additionally, one of our subsidiaries is party to a large construction project that is experiencing project delays that have resulted in significant additional costs. Further delays in the project completion schedule or legal action related to such project could have additional negative impact on our operating results. Changes in architectural trends, building codes or consumer preferencesAny change in commercial construction customer preference, architectural trends or building codes that reduce window-to-wall ratios could negatively impact net sales and operating income in our architectural-related segments. The LSO segment depends on U.S. consumers framing art and other decorative items. Any shift in customer preference away from framed art to other forms of wall decor could negatively impact future net sales and operating income in the LSO segment.Customer dependence in the LSO segmentThe LSO segment is highly dependent on a relatively small number of customers for its sales, while working to grow in new markets and with new customers. Accordingly, loss of a significant customer, a significant reduction in pricing, or a shift to a less favorable mix of value-added picture framing glass or acrylic products for one or more of those customers could materially reduce LSO net sales and operating results.10Table of ContentsResults can differ significantly from our expectations and the expectations of analystsOur sales and earnings guidance and resulting external analyst estimates are largely based on our view of our business and the broader commercial construction market. Even though we have market intelligence through our contacts with real estate developers, building owners and architects, and continually monitor micro- and macro-economic indicators of future performance of the commercial construction market, we are unable to precisely predict events that can significantly change market cycles. Failure to meet our guidance or analyst expectations for net sales and earnings would likely have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. Significant risk retention through self-insurance programs We obtain third-party insurance to provide coverage for potential risk in areas such as employment practices, workers' compensation, directors and officers, automobile, architect's and engineer's errors and omissions, product rework and general liability, as well as medical insurance and various other coverages.

The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our reputation and could result in litigation, regulatory action, project delay claims, and increased costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection systems.Use of hazardous chemicals and environmental complianceWe use hazardous chemicals in the production process of some of our products. As a result, we are subject to a variety of local, state and federal governmental regulations relating to storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products, compliance with which is expensive. Our failure to comply with current or future environmental regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes or increased costs"

Loss of key personnel and inability to source sufficient laborOur success depends on the skills of the Company's leadership, construction project managers and other key technical personnel, and our ability to secure sufficient manufacturing labor.  Increased activity in residential and commercial construction has caused increased competition for experienced construction project managers.  Additionally, some of our manufacturing facilities are located in regions that at times may experience low levels of unemployment.  If we are unable to retain existing employees and/or recruit and train additional employees with the requisite skills and experience, our operating results could be adversely impacted.Commodity price fluctuations and supply availabilityOur Architectural Framing Systems and Architectural Services segments use aluminum as a significant input to their products. While we structure many of our supply agreements in a way to moderate the effects of fluctuations in the market for raw aluminum, and we are usually eventually able to pass aluminum cost increases on to our customers, short-term operating results could be negatively impacted by sudden price movements in the market for raw aluminum.Our Architectural Glass segment uses raw glass as a significant input to its products. The supply of raw glass has become tighter due to several years of growth in automotive manufacturing and residential and non-residential construction. Although we have secured supply commitments from multiple suppliers that allow us to reach our near-term growth targets, a significant unplanned downtime at one or more of our key suppliers could negatively impact our operating results.Product quality issuesWe manufacture and/or install a significant portion of our products based on the specific requirements of each customer. We believe that future orders of our products or services will depend on our ability to maintain the performance, reliability and quality standards required by our customers. If our products have performance, reliability or quality problems, or products are installed using incompatible glazing materials or installed improperly (by us or a customer), we may experience: additional warranty expense; reduced or canceled orders; higher manufacturing or installation costs; or delays in the collection of accounts receivable. Additionally, performance, reliability or quality claims from our customers, with or without merit, could result in costly and time-consuming litigation that could require significant time and attention of management and involve significant monetary damages that could negatively impact our financial results.Project management and installation issuesThe Architectural Services segment and, occasionally, a portion of the Architectural Framing Systems segment are awarded fixed-price contracts for installation services. Often, bids are required before all aspects of a construction project are known. An underestimate in the amount of labor required and/or cost of materials for a project; a change in the timing of the delivery of product; system design errors, difficulties or errors in execution; or significant project delays, caused by us or other trades, could result in failure to achieve the expected results. Any one or more of such issues could result in losses on individual contracts that could negatively impact our operating results.Changes in architectural trends, building codes or consumer preferencesAny change in commercial construction customer preference, architectural trends or building codes that reduce window-to-wall ratios in non-residential construction would negatively impact net sales and operating income in our architectural-related segments. The LSO segment depends on U.S. consumers framing art and other decorative items. Any shift in customer preference away from framed art to other forms of wall decor could negatively impact future net sales and operating income in the LSO segment.Customer dependence in the LSO segmentThe LSO segment is highly dependent on a relatively small number of customers for its sales, and we expect this to continue in the future. Accordingly, loss of a significant customer, a significant reduction in pricing, or a shift to a less favorable mix of value-10Table of Contentsadded picture framing glass or acrylic products for one of those customers, could materially reduce LSO net sales and operating results.Results can differ significantly from our expectations and the expectations of analystsOur sales and earnings guidance and external analyst estimates are largely based on our view of our business and the broader commercial construction market. Even though we have significant market intelligence through our contact with real estate developers, building owners and architects, and continually monitor micro- and macro-economic indicators of future performance of the commercial construction market, we are unable to precisely predict events that can significantly change market cycles. Failure to meet our guidance or analyst expectations for net sales and earnings would likely have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. Significant risk retention through self-insurance programs We obtain third-party insurance for potential losses from general liability, employment practices, workers' compensation and automobile liability risk, as well as medical insurance. However, a high amount of risk is retained on a self-insured basis, partially through our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary. Therefore, a material architectural product liability event could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Dependence on information technology systems and potential security threatsOur operations are dependent upon various information technology systems that are used to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support our manufacturing operations and a variety of other business processes and activities. We could encounter difficulties in maintaining our existing systems, and developing and implementing new systems.  Such difficulties could lead to disruption in business operations and/or significant additional expenses that could adversely affect our results. Additionally, information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Should such an attack succeed, it could lead to the compromise of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data and product specifications, production downtimes, disruption in the availability of financial data, or misrepresentation of information via digital media. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our reputation and could result in litigation, regulatory action, project delay claims, and increased costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection systems.Use of hazardous chemicals and environmental complianceWe use hazardous chemicals in the production process of some of our products. One of our facilities has certain historical environmental conditions that are in the process of being remediated. Our inability to remediate the historical environmental conditions at the facility at or below the amounts reserved could have an adverse impact on future financial results. Additionally, we are subject to a variety of local, state and federal governmental regulations relating to storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products, compliance with which is expensive. Our failure to comply with current or future environmental regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes or increased costs"

Any of the risks discussed below, or elsewhere in this Form 10-K or our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.8Table of ContentsGeneral global economic and business conditions could negatively affect our results.Our Architectural Glass, Architectural Services and Architectural Framing Systems segments are dependent on global economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the North American commercial construction industry. The commercial construction industry is impacted by global macroeconomic trends, including, among other things, availability of credit, unemployment rates, consumer confidence, interest rates and commodity prices. To the extent changes in these factors negatively impact the overall commercial construction industry, our revenue and profits could be significantly reduced. Our Architectural Glass segment's operation located in Brazil is subject to the economic, political and tax conditions prevalent in the region. We cannot predict how changing economic conditions in this region will impact our financial results; however, our Brazilian operation makes up less than five percent of our net sales annually.Our LSO segment depends on the strength of the retail custom picture framing industry. This industry is highly dependent on consumer confidence and the conditions of the U.S. economy. A decline in consumer confidence, whether as a result of an economic slowdown, uncertainty regarding the future or other factors, could result in a decrease in net sales and operating income of this segment.Fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively impact our results and financial position.Our subsidiaries in Canada and Brazil report their results of operations and financial position in their relevant functional currencies (local country currency), which are then translated into U.S. dollars. This translated financial information is included in our consolidated financial statements. The strength of the U.S. dollar in comparison to these functional currencies has had and could continue to have a negative impact on our reported results and financial position.In addition, as the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, imports of products into the U.S. produced by international competitors have become more price competitive and exports of our U.S.-fabricated products have become less price competitive. If we are not able to counteract these price pressures through superior quality and service, our net sales and operating income could be negatively impacted. New competitors or specific actions of our existing competitors could adversely impact our industry position and future results.All of our operating segments operate in competitive industries where the actions of our existing competitors or new competitors  could result in a loss of customers or share of customers' demand. Changes in our competitors' products, prices or services could negatively impact our share of demand, net sales or margins.Our Architectural Glass and Architectural Framing Systems segments have seen an increase in imports of competitive products into the U.S. from international suppliers due to the relative strength of the U.S. dollar. If imports of competitive products were to occur at increased levels for extended periods of time, our net sales and margins could be negatively impacted. Our LSO segment competes with several international specialty glass manufacturers that have traditionally been less focused on the U.S. custom picture framing industry. Although these LSO competitors generally have not been able to meet the specification level of our products, upgrades to our competitor's products, and/or their increased interest in U.S. sales could have a negative impact on net sales or margins.Our ability to effectively utilize our manufacturing capacity could adversely impact future results. Near-term performance depends, to a significant degree, on our ability to increase and appropriately utilize available production capacity. The failure to successfully maintain existing capacity, utilize capacity expansions, and invest in additional physical capacity could adversely affect our operating results. Loss of key personnel and inability to source sufficient labor could impact our future results.Our success depends on the skills and experience of our current management team, construction project managers and other key technical personnel, and our ability to secure sufficient manufacturing labor.  Increased activity in residential and commercial construction has caused increased competition for experienced construction project managers.  Additionally, some of our manufacturing facilities are located in regions that at times may experience low levels of unemployment.  If we are unable to retain existing employees and/or recruit and train additional employees with the requisite skills and experience, our results could be adversely impacted.Interruptions in glass supply could impact our future operating results.The supply of raw glass has become tighter due to several years of growth in automotive manufacturing, residential construction and non-residential construction.

The economic conditions in this region are subject to different growth expectations, market weaknesses and business practices than seen in the U.S. market. We cannot predict how changing market conditions in this region will impact our financial results.Our LSO segment depends on the strength of the retail picture framing market. This market is highly dependent on consumer confidence and the conditions of the U.S. economy. We have been able to partially offset the impact of economic slowdowns in the recent past with an increase in the mix of higher value-added picture framing products. If consumer confidence further declines, whether as a result of an economic slowdown, uncertainty regarding the future or other factors, our use of these strategies may not be as successful in the future, resulting in a potential decrease in net sales and operating income.CompetitorsAll of our operating segments operate in competitive markets where the actions of competitors or new market entrants could result in a loss of customers or share of that customer's purchases. Additionally, changes in our competitor's products, prices or services could negatively impact our market share, net sales or margins.Our Architectural Glass and Architectural Framing Systems segments have seen an increase in imports of competitive products from lower-cost, international suppliers that, if this were to continue, could impact our net sales and margins. Our LSO segment competes with several small international specialty glass manufacturers that have traditionally not penetrated the domestic markets. Although these LSO competitors tend to be low price providers and have not been able to meet the specification level of our products, upgrades to our competitor's products could drive prices down, which could have a negative impact on our share of demand, net sales or margins.10Table of ContentsCapacity utilizationNear-term performance depends, to a significant degree, on our ability to utilize available production capacity. The failure to successfully utilize or manage capacity, the impact of closing a facility in the future, or re-opening a currently closed facility, could adversely affect our operating results. Additionally, advances in product or process technologies on the part of existing or prospective competitors could have a significant impact on our ability to utilize our capacity and, therefore, have an adverse impact on our net sales and operating results. Product qualityWe manufacture and/or install a significant portion of our products based on specific requirements of each customer. We believe that future orders of our products or services will depend on our ability to maintain the performance, reliability and quality standards required by our customers. If our products or services have performance, reliability or quality problems, or products are installed with incompatible glazing materials, we may experience additional warranty and service expense; reduced or canceled orders; diminished pricing power; higher manufacturing or installation costs; or delays in the collection of accounts receivable. Additionally, performance, reliability or quality claims from our customers, with or without merit, could result in costly and time-consuming litigation that could require significant time and attention of management and involve significant monetary damages that could negatively impact our financial results.Project management and installation issuesThe Architectural Services segment is typically awarded fixed-price contracts for installation services. Often, bids are required before all aspects of a construction project are known. An underestimate in the amount of labor required and/or cost of materials for a project; a change in the timing of the delivery of product; difficulties or errors in execution; use of incompatible glazing materials; or significant project delays, caused by us or other trades, could result in failure to achieve the expected results. Any such issues could result in losses on individual contracts that could impact our operating results.Tax incentivesWe have recently made commitments to expand certain manufacturing facilities and make investments in new manufacturing capabilities. Contributing to the decision to make such investments was the availability of federal, state and local tax incentives including tax credits, tax increment financing and grants. If the Company is not able to realize the benefits of planned tax incentive packages, future operating results could be negatively impacted.Consumer preference changesAny change in customer preference, architectural trends or building codes that reduces window-to-wall ratios in non-residential construction would negatively impact net sales and operating income in our Architectural Glass, Architectural Framing Systems and Architectural Services segments. The LSO segment depends on U.S. consumers framing art and other decorative items. Any shift in customer preference away from framed art to other forms of decorative media could negatively impact future net sales and operating income.Customer concentrationThe LSO segment is highly dependent on a relatively small number of customers for its sales. We continue to expect to derive a significant portion of our net sales from a small number of customers. Accordingly, loss of a significant customer or a significant reduction in pricing, or a shift to a less favorable mix of value-added picture framing glass or acrylic products for one of those customers could materially reduce LSO net sales and operating results in any one year.Financial RisksVolatility of global financial marketsGlobal financial markets have been experiencing disruption over the past several years, including, among other things, volatility in securities prices; diminished liquidity and credit availability; rating downgrades of certain investments; and changes in valuation of foreign currency against the U.S. dollar. Further volatility could lead to challenges in our business and negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations, or lead to impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill. The tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect our ability, as well as the ability of our customers and suppliers, to obtain and maintain financing. In addition, lack of financing for commercial construction projects could further result in a decrease in orders and spending for our products and services. We also maintain a significant amount of assets in the form of investments, primarily municipal bonds. The value of these investments and the timing of our need for cash could have a significant negative impact on our operating results.11Table of ContentsPredictability and volatility of net sales and operating profitsOur net sales and operating results may fall below Company-provided guidance and the expectations of securities analysts or investors in future periods. Our annual net sales and operating results may vary depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, fluctuating customer demand, delay or timing of shipments, construction delays or cancellations due to lack of financing for construction projects, changes in product and project mix or market acceptance of new products. Manufacturing or operational difficulties that may arise due to quality control, capacity utilization of our production equipment or staffing requirements may also adversely impact our annual net sales and operating results. In addition, competition, including new entrants into our markets, the introduction of new products by competitors, adoption of competitive technologies by our customers, and competitive pressures on prices of our products and services, could adversely impact our annual net sales and operating results. Finally, our annual net sales and operating results may vary depending on raw material pricing and the potential for disruption of supply, and changes in legislation that could have an adverse impact on our labor or other costs. Our failure to meet net sales and operating result expectations would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  Self-Insurance and Product Liability Risk We obtain third-party insurance for potential losses from general liability, employment practices, workers' compensation and automobile liability risk. However, a high amount of risk is retained on a self-insured basis through a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary. Therefore, a material product liability event, such as a material rework event, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Environmental Regulation Risks We use hazardous chemicals in producing our products. One of our facilities has certain historical environmental conditions which we believe require remediation. Our inability to remediate the historical environmental conditions at the facility at or below the amounts reserved, therefore, could have a material adverse impact on future financial results. Additionally, we are subject to a variety of local, state and federal governmental regulations relating to storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products, compliance with which is expensive. Our failure to comply with current or future environmental regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines on us, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes or increased costs. Our financial results could also be adversely impacted by rising energy and material costs associated with environmental regulations. Personnel Risks Our success depends on the skills, experience and efforts of our executive management and other key personnel. If, for any reason, one or more senior executives or key personnel were not to remain active in our Company, our financial results could be adversely affected"

Any of the risks discussed below, or elsewhere in the Form 10-K orour other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could have a material adverseimpact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additional risks anduncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may alsomaterially impair our business operations.Operational RisksArchitectural SegmentThe Architectural segment designs, engineers, fabricates, installs, maintains and renovates thewalls of glass, windows, storefront and entrances comprising the outside skin of commercial andinstitutional buildings. This segment has tended to lag the North American commercial constructionindustry cycle by approximately nine months. There can be no assurance the trends experienced bythe segment will continue.The Architectural segments markets are very competitive and actions of competitors or new marketentrants could result in a loss of customers that would negatively impact revenues and earnings.The markets that the Architectural segment serves are product-attribute, price and lead-timesensitive. The segment competes with several large, integrated glass manufacturers, numerousspecialty, architectural glass and window fabricators, and major contractors and subcontractors.Some of our competitors may have greater financial or other resources than the Company. Changes inour competitors products, prices or services could negatively impact our market share, revenuesand margins.Global economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the North American commercial constructionindustry could have an adverse impact on the profitability of this segment. There has traditionallybeen a lag between the general domestic economy and the commercial construction industry, and anadditional approximate nine-month lag as it relates to our products and services. Our Architecturalsegment businesses are primarily impacted by changes in the North American commercial constructionindustry, including unforeseen delays in project timing and work flow. These and other economicconditions could impact the overall commercial construction industry and may adversely impact themarkets we serve or the timing of the lag, resulting in lower revenues and earnings.9Table of ContentsThe Architectural segment results could be adversely impacted by product quality and performancereliability problems. We manufacture and/or install a significant portion of our products based onspecific requirements of each of our customers. We believe that future orders of our products orservices will depend on our ability to maintain the performance, reliability and quality standardsrequired by our customers. If our products or services have performance, reliability or qualityproblems, we may experience delays in the collection of accounts receivable, higher manufacturingor installation costs, additional warranty and service expense, and reduced, cancelled ordiscontinued orders. Additionally, performance, reliability or quality claims from our customers,with or without merit, could result in costly and time-consuming litigation that could requiresignificant time and attention of management and involve significant monetary damages that couldnegatively impact our financial results.The Architectural results could be adversely impacted by capacity utilization and changes intechnology impacting capacity utilization. The Architectural segments near-term performancedepends, to a significant degree, on its ability to fully utilize capacity at its productionfacilities. The failure to successfully utilize and manage capacity in the future, especially inthe down cycle, could adversely affect our operating results. Additionally, advances in product orprocess technologies on the part of existing or prospective competitors could have a significantimpact on our ability to utilize our capacity and, therefore, have an adverse impact on ouroperating results.The Architectural results could be adversely impacted by installation issues. The Companysinstallation and renovation business typically is awarded as a fixed-price contract. Often, bidsare required before all aspects of a construction project are known. An underestimate in the amountof labor required and/or cost of materials for a project, a change in the timing of the delivery ofproduct, difficulties or errors in execution, or significant delays could result in failure toachieve the expected results. Any such issues could result in losses on individual contracts thatcould impact our operating results.Large-Scale Optical Technologies (LSO)The LSO segment develops and produces applications that enhance the visual performance of productsfor picture framing and commercial optics. In the past, the revenue and profitability of thissegment have been inconsistent from year to year. Over the last several years, the segment hastransitioned away from consumer electronics and pre-framed art, and focused its efforts onvalue-added picture framing glass and acrylic products. There can be no assurance that the revenueand profitability patterns experienced by the segment will not change in the near future or thatthe current trend to value-added products will continue.The LSO segment is highly dependent on a relatively small number of customers for its sales. Wecontinue to expect to derive a significant portion of our net sales from a small number ofcustomers. Accordingly, loss of a significant customer or a significant shift to a less favorablemix of value-added picture framing glass products for one of those customers could materiallyreduce LSO revenues and operating results in any one year.The LSO segment is highly dependent on U.S. consumer confidence and the U.S. economy. Our businessin this segment depends on the strength of the retail picture framing market. This market is highlydependent on consumer confidence and the conditions of the U.S. economy. We have been able topartially offset the impact of economic slowdowns in the recent past with new products and anincrease in the mix of higher value-added picture framing products. If consumer confidence furtherdeclines, whether as a result of an economic slowdown, uncertainty regarding the future or otherfactors, our use of these strategies may not be as successful in the future, resulting in apotentially significant decrease in revenues and operating income.The LSO segment results could be adversely impacted by capacity utilization. The LSO segmentsnear-term performance depends, to a significant degree, on its ability to utilize its productioncapacity, especially since we have increased the capacity for our highest value-added pictureframing glass and acrylic products. The failure to successfully integrate and manage thisadditional capacity could adversely impact operating results.Other Operational RisksThe Companys results may be adversely impacted by implementation of an Enterprise ResourcePlanning (ERP) system. During fiscal 2008 and throughout fiscal 2009, the Company beganimplementing a company-wide ERP system to upgrade its information system technologies. Thecontinuing multi-year initiative will enhance internal processes, improve access to information andimprove the control environment. The complexities of an ERP implementation and large-scale processchanges that will be required could result in costs that exceed the project budget, businessinterruptions and reduced financial performance, adversely impacting operating results.10Table of ContentsFinancial RisksVolatility in the global economy could adversely affect results of operations and our financialcondition. Global financial markets have been experiencing extreme disruption over the past year,including, among other things, volatility in securities prices, diminished liquidity and creditavailability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. Theseconditions have had an adverse impact on our recent results of operations. Further volatility couldlead to challenges in our business and negatively impact our financial condition or results ofoperations. The tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect our ability, aswell as the ability of our customers and suppliers, to obtain financing. In addition, lack offinancing for commercial construction projects could further result in a decrease in orders andspending for our products and services. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severityof the current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions and the effects theymay have on our business and financial condition.Our quarterly and annual revenue and operating results are volatile and difficult to predict. Ourrevenue and operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts,company-provided guidance or investors in future periods. Our annual revenue and operating resultsmay vary depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: fluctuating customerdemand, delay or timing of shipments, construction delays or cancellation due to lack of financingfor construction projects, changes in product and project mix or market acceptance of new products;manufacturing or operational difficulties that may arise due to quality control, capacityutilization of our production equipment or staffing requirements; competition, including newentrants into our markets, the introduction of new products by competitors, adoption of competitivetechnologies by our customers, competitive pressures on prices of our products and services; rawmaterial pricing and the potential for disruption of supply; and changes in legislation that couldhave an adverse impact on our labor or other costs. Our failure to meet revenue and operatingresult expectations would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock.Self-Insurance and Product Liability RiskWe retain a high level of uninsured risk; a material claim could impact our financial results. Weobtain substantial amounts of commercial insurance for potential losses for general liability,employment practices, workers compensation and automobile liability risk. However, a high amountof risk is retained on a self-insured basis through a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary. Therefore,a material product liability event, such as a material rework event, could have a material adverseeffect on our operating results.Environmental Regulation RisksWe are subject to potential environmental, remediation and compliance risks that could adverselyaffect our financial results. We use hazardous chemicals in producing products at three facilities(two in our Architectural segment and one in our LSO segment). One facility in our Architecturalsegment has certain historical environmental conditions which we believe require remediation. Weare subject to a variety of local, state and federal governmental regulations relating to storage,discharge, handling, emission, generation and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances usedto manufacture our products, compliance with which is expensive. Our failure to comply with currentor future environmental regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines on us,suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes or increased costs.Additionally, our inability to remediate the historical environmental conditions at theArchitectural segment facility at or below the amounts estimated as part of the purchase priceallocation could have a material adverse impact on future financial results.Discontinued Curtainwall OperationsThe risks and uncertainties associated with discontinued operations could adversely impact theCompany. During fiscal 1998, we made the strategic decision to close or exit our European andAsian international curtainwall operations in order to focus more selectively on higher-margindomestic curtainwall business. During fiscal 1999, we decided to sell our domestic large-scalecurtainwall operation. We maintain risks associated with closing the domestic and internationaloperations from performance bonds established with our customers and remaining warranty coveragesthat exist on completed projects"
