Our operations are affected by various risks, many of which are beyond our control. In evaluating investment in the Company and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or presented elsewhere from time to time, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made and could adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. The risks described below are not all inclusive but are designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. In addition to such risks, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business, performance, or financial condition in the future that are not presently known, are not currently believed to be significant, or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses.Risks Related to Economic ConditionsChanges in global and regional economic conditions, the markets we serve, or the financial markets may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.Unfavorable conditions in the global economy or regional economies, the markets we serve or financial markets may decrease the demand for our goods and services and adversely impact our revenues, operating results, and cash flows.Demand for our products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which we do business. Weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past and may do so in the future. In addition, our growth strategy is largely based on demand for technologies and projects that limit the impact of global climate change. Demand for our solutions could be negatively impacted if public and private actors reduce their focus on reducing carbon emissions. Reduced demand for our products and services would have a negative impact on our revenues and earnings. In addition, reduced demand could depress sales, decrease our margins, constrain our operating flexibility or reduce efficient utilization of our manufacturing capacity, or result in charges which are unusual or nonrecurring. Excess capacity in our manufacturing facilities or those of our competitors could decrease our ability to maintain pricing and generate profits.In addition, our operating results in one or more segments may be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic conditions for particular customer markets within a segment. A decline in the industries served by our customers or adverse events or circumstances affecting individual customers can reduce demand for our products and services and impair the ability of such customers to satisfy their obligations to us, resulting in uncollected receivables, unanticipated contract terminations, project delays or the inability to recover plant investments, any of which may negatively impact our financial results.Weak overall demand or specific customer conditions may also cause customer shutdowns or defaults or otherwise make us unable to operate facilities profitably and may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment or prevent projects from coming on-stream when expected. These or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific market, product, or customer events may require us to record an impairment on tangible assets, such as facilities and equipment, or intangible assets, such as intellectual property or goodwill, which would have a negative impact on our financial results.Our extensive international operations can be adversely impacted by operational, economic, political, security, legal, and currency translation risks that could decrease profitability.In fiscal year 2023, approximately 60% of our sales were derived from customers outside the United States and many of our operations, suppliers, and employees are located outside the United States. Our operations in foreign jurisdictions may be subject to risks including exchange control regulations, import and trade restrictions, trade policy and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting U.S. companies doing business abroad. Changing economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions, strained relations between countries, or the imposition of tariffs or international sanctions can cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.11Table of ContentsOur growth strategies depend in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the United States, such as China, India, and the Middle East, and involve significantly larger and more complex projects, including gasification and large-scale hydrogen projects, some in regions where there is the potential for significant economic and political disruptions. We are actively investing large amounts of capital and other resources, in some cases through joint ventures, in developing markets, which we believe to have high growth potential. Our operations in these markets may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies, including political and economic instability, project delay or abandonment due to unanticipated government actions, inadequate investment in infrastructure, undeveloped property rights and legal systems, unfamiliar regulatory environments, relationships with local partners, language and cultural differences and increased difficulty recruiting, training and retaining qualified employees. In addition, our properties and contracts in these locations may be subject to seizure and cancellation, respectively, without full compensation for loss. Successful operation of particular facilities or execution of projects may be disrupted by civil unrest, acts of war, sabotage or terrorism, and other local security concerns. Such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or require us to shut down operations for a period of time.Furthermore, because the majority of our revenue is generated from sales outside the United States, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our business is primarily exposed to translational currency risk as the results of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates throughout the fiscal period. Our policy is to minimize cash flow volatility from changes in currency exchange rates. We choose not to hedge the translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ earnings into dollars. Accordingly, reported sales, net earnings, cash flows, and fair values have been, and in the future will be, affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. For a more detailed discussion of currency exposure, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, below.Risks Related to Our BusinessRisks related to the approval, execution, and operation of our projects, particularly with respect to our largest projects, may adversely affect our operations or financial results.A significant and growing portion of our business involves clean hydrogen, carbon capture, gasification, and other large-scale projects that involve challenging engineering, procurement and construction phases that may last several years and involve the investment of billions of dollars. These projects are technically complex, often reliant on significant interaction with government authorities, and face significant financing, development, operational, and reputational risks. These projects may also be subject to complex government approvals, as well as legal or regulatory challenges by government authorities or third parties. Delays in receiving required approvals or related to litigation could require us to delay or abandon certain projects, which may result in the incurrence of additional expense, the loss of invested proceeds and reputational damage.We have in the past and may in the future encounter difficulties related to the development of projects that may result in delays, scope changes and additional costs. Such difficulties may relate to engineering, delays in designs or materials provided by the customer or a third party, equipment and materials delivery delays, schedule changes, customer scope changes, delays related to obtaining regulatory permits and rights-of-way, inability to find adequate sources of labor in the locations where we are building new plants, weather-related delays, delays by customers' contractors in completing their portion of a project, technical or transportation difficulties, cost overruns, supply difficulties, geopolitical risks and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, that may impact our ability to complete a project within the original delivery schedule. In some cases, delays and additional costs may be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We also may be required to cancel a project and/or compensate the customer for the delay, which may also cause us to incur material costs that we may be unable to recover. In addition, in some cases we seek financing for large projects and face market risk associated with the availability and terms of such financing. These financing arrangements may require that we comply with certain performance requirements which, if not met, could result in default and restructuring costs or other losses. All of these factors could also negatively impact our reputation or relationships with our customers, suppliers and other third parties, any of which could adversely affect our ability to secure new projects in the future.In addition, several of our large-scale projects are being built before finalization of offtake agreements, which may create uncertainty regarding future pricing and other commercial terms. If we are unable to enter into favorable commercial agreements with prospective customers, our projected returns could be adversely impacted, which may harm our business and financial performance.12Table of ContentsThe operation of our facilities, pipelines, and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control, such as pipeline leaks and ruptures, fire, explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures, vehicle accidents, or cyber incidents. If operational risks materialize, they could result in loss of life, damage to the environment, or loss of production, all of which could negatively impact our ongoing operations, reputation, financial results, and cash flows. In addition, our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities and our ability to meet customer requirements, which depend, in part, on our ability to properly maintain and replace aging assets.We are subject to extensive government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Regulations addressing, among other things, import/export restrictions, anti-bribery and corruption, and taxes, can negatively impact our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.We are subject to government regulation in the United States and in the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business. The application of laws and regulations to our business is sometimes unclear. Compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that could result in reduced profitability. If there is a determination that we have failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations, we may be subject to penalties or sanctions that could adversely impact our reputation and financial results. Compliance with changes in laws or regulations can result in increased operating costs and require additional, unplanned capital expenditures. Export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent us from shipping our products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so. Changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of our businesses. Increasingly aggressive enforcement of anti-bribery and anti-corruption requirements, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act and the China Anti-Unfair Competition Law, could subject us to criminal or civil sanctions if a violation is deemed to have occurred. In addition, we are subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit us, or certain of our affiliates, from doing business in certain countries, or restricting the kind of business that we may conduct. Such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who are not subject to comparable restrictions or prevent us from taking advantage of growth opportunities.Further, we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents, business partners or that businesses that we acquire would not violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering, and data privacy. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.We may be unable to successfully identify, execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, manage our joint ventures, or effectively disentangle divested businesses.Our ability to grow revenue, earnings, and cash flow at anticipated rates depends in part on our ability to identify, successfully acquire and integrate businesses and assets at appropriate prices, and realize expected growth, synergies, and operating efficiencies. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by the failure of acquired businesses or assets to meet expected returns, the failure to integrate acquired businesses, the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions, and the discovery of unanticipated liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses or assets for which we lack adequate contractual protections or insurance. In addition, we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that do not meet expectations.In addition, some of our largest projects involve joint ventures. These arrangements may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including our ability to cooperate with our strategic partners, our strategic partners having interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and the potential that our strategic partners may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations to the joint venture, which may negatively impact the expected benefits of the joint venture and cause us to incur additional expense or suffer reputational damage. In addition, due to the nature of these arrangements, we may have limited ability to direct or influence the management of the joint venture, which may limit our ability to assist and oversee the design and implementation of the joint venture’s business as well as its accounting, legal, governance, human resources, information technology, and other administrative systems. This may expose us to additional risks and uncertainties because we may be dependent upon and subject to liability, losses, or reputational damage relating to systems, controls, and personnel that are not under our control. These risks may be augmented when the joint venture is operating outside the United States due to differences in language, culture, and regulation, as well as the factors listed above that are relevant to our international operations.13Table of ContentsWe continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. These transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements. For example, when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated time frame or at all. In addition, divestitures or other dispositions may dilute our earnings per share, have other adverse financial and accounting impacts, distract management, and give rise to disputes with buyers. In addition, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to indemnify buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities. Our financial results could be impacted adversely by claims under these indemnification provisions.The security of our information technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect our ability to operate.We depend on information technology to enable us to operate safely and efficiently and interface with our customers as well as to maintain our internal control environment and financial reporting accuracy and efficiency. Our information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and external services and service providers. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, property damage, or the loss of or damage to our confidential business information due to a security breach. In addition, our information technology systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Security breaches of our systems (or the systems of our customers, suppliers or other business partners) could result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized access or disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, and may subject us to legal liability.As with most large systems, our information technology systems have in the past been, and in the future likely will be subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks, and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase. To date, we are not aware of any significant impact on our operations or financial results from such attempts; however, unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations, result in the loss of assets, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could: interrupt our operations at one or more sites; delay production and shipments; result in the theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets; damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation; result in defective products or services, physical damage to facilities, pipelines or delivery systems, including those we own or operate for third parties, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws, or increased costs for security and remediation; or raise concerns regarding our internal control environment and internal control over financial reporting. Each of these consequences could adversely affect our business, reputation and our financial statements.Our business involves the use, storage, and transmission of information about our employees, vendors, and customers. The protection of such information, as well as our proprietary information, is critical to us. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. We have established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information. We also, from time to time, export sensitive customer data and technical information to recipients outside the United States. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, which could ultimately result in litigation and potential legal and financial liability. These events could also damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business.Interruption in ordinary sources of raw material or energy supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability.Hydrocarbons, including natural gas, are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas. Energy, including electricity, natural gas, and diesel fuel for delivery trucks, is the largest cost component of our business. Because our industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity, inflation and energy price fluctuations have impacted our revenues and earnings and may continue to do so in the future. A disruption in the supply of energy, components, or raw materials, whether due to market conditions, legislative or regulatory actions, natural disasters, public health crises and pandemics, or other disruption, could prevent us from meeting our contractual commitments and harm our business and financial results.14Table of ContentsOur supply of crude helium for purification and resale is largely dependent upon natural gas production by crude helium suppliers. Lower natural gas production resulting from natural gas pricing dynamics, supplier operating or transportation issues, or other interruptions in sales from crude helium suppliers, can reduce our supplies of crude helium available for processing and resale to customers.We typically contract to pass-through cost increases in energy and raw materials to customers, but such cost pass-through results in declining margins, and cost variability can negatively impact our other operating results. For example, we may be unable to raise prices as quickly as costs rise, or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery of such costs. In addition, increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons may negatively impact our revenues and earnings. Even where costs are passed through, price increases can cause lower sales volume.New technologies create performance risks that could impact our financial results or reputation.We are continually developing and implementing new technologies and product offerings. Existing technologies are being implemented in products and designs or at scales beyond our experience base. These technological expansions can create nontraditional performance risks to our operations. Failure of the technologies to work as predicted, or unintended consequences of new designs or uses, could lead to cost overruns, project delays, financial penalties, or damage to our reputation. We may face difficulties marketing products produced using new technologies including, but not limited to, green hydrogen, which may adversely impact our sales and financial results. In addition, certain large-scale projects may contain processes or technologies that we have not operated at the same scale or in the same combination, and although such projects generally include technologies and processes that have been demonstrated previously by others, such technologies or processes may be new to us and may introduce new risks to our operations. Additionally, there is also a risk that our new technologies may become obsolete and be replaced by other market alternatives. Performance difficulties on these larger projects may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. In addition, performance challenges may adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain future contracts.Protecting our intellectual property is critical to our technological development, and we may suffer competitive harm from infringement on such rights. As we develop new technologies, it is critical that we protect our intellectual property assets against third-party infringement. We own a number of patents and other forms of intellectual property related to our products and services. As we develop new technologies there is a risk that our patent applications may not be granted, or we may not receive sufficient protection of our proprietary interests. We may also expend considerable resources in defending our patents against third-party infringement. It is critical that we protect our proprietary interests to prevent competitive harm. Legal and Regulatory RisksLegislative, regulatory, societal, and market efforts to address global climate change may impact our business and create financial risk.We are the world’s leading supplier of hydrogen, the primary use of which is the production of ultra-low sulfur transportation fuels that have significantly reduced transportation emissions and helped improve human health. To make the high volumes of hydrogen needed by our customers, we have historically used steam methane reforming to produce hydrogen without carbon capture (i.e., ""gray hydrogen""), which results in the emission of carbon dioxide. In addition, gasification enables the conversion of lower value feedstocks into cleaner energy and value-added products; however, our gasification projects also produce carbon dioxide. Some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing disclosure of GHG emissions, including CO2, such as the European Union's CSRD, California’s Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and Climate Related Financial Risk Act, and similar regulations under consideration by the SEC, which may lead to direct and indirect costs on our operations. We could also face scrutiny from stakeholders regarding our reporting under various frameworks for disclosing GHG emissions-related data, including those we use currently in our sustainability reporting. If our GHG emissions-related data, processes, and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to comply with relevant reporting frameworks from newly emerging regulations, we may incur monetary penalties and reputational harm, and we could become subject to litigation or government investigations, which may also adversely affect our reputation and business.15Table of ContentsIncreased public concern and governmental action may result in more international, U.S. federal and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG emissions or increased demand for technologies and projects to limit the impact of global climate change. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production, and application of our gasification technology, although these developments may be mitigated by our growth strategy focused on world-scale clean hydrogen projects. We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the long-term impact these measures will have on our operations. Any legislation or governmental action that limits or taxes GHG emissions could negatively impact our growth, increase our operating costs, or reduce demand for certain of our products, particularly for our core industrial gases business.In addition, our growth strategy is partially dependent on a regulatory environment that favors technologies focused on limiting the impact of climate change, in particular toward the production and distribution of clean hydrogen. For example, we anticipate benefits from tax incentives created by the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 for carbon sequestration and clean hydrogen production in future years once our projects in these areas come on-stream in the U.S. If there is a reversal in the regulatory environment or a discontinuation or reduction of incentives or benefits for the development of technologies limiting the impact of climate change, particularly those focused on low- and zero-carbon hydrogen production, demand for our products may be less than we anticipate and certain projects and our long-term growth strategy could be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance.Our operations may present a safety risk to our employees.Notwithstanding our emphasis on the safety of our employees and contractors and the precautions we take related to health and safety, we may be unable to avoid safety incidents relating to our operations that result in injuries or deaths. Certain safety incidents may result in legal or regulatory action that could result in increased expenses or reputational damage. We maintain workers' compensation insurance to address the risk of incurring material liabilities for injuries or deaths, but there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could result in material liabilities to us for any injuries or deaths. Changes to federal, state, and local employee health and safety regulations, and legislative, regulatory, or societal responses to safety incidents may result in heightened regulations or public scrutiny that may increase our compliance costs or result in reputational damage.Our business depends on our ability to attract, develop, engage, and retain qualified employees.Our success depends on our ability to attract, develop, engage, and retain employees with the skills necessary to our business. Competitive labor market conditions have resulted in increased demand for qualified personnel, which makes it difficult to attract, hire, and retain employees with specialized technical experience. In addition, the increasing number of experienced employees becoming retirement-eligible and our company headcount growth further amplify this challenge. The number of our employees has grown both internationally and in the United States, with our total headcount increasing from approximately 16,300 at the end of fiscal 2018 to approximately 23,000 at the end of fiscal 2023. Our results of operations have been and in the future could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for skilled talent in the market. In addition, increased turnover and decreased tenure of employees may impact productivity, costs, and organizational culture. We undertake significant efforts to hire, engage, and retain our employees and to effectively manage workforce costs, even with rapid political, social, and economic shifts in our markets. If these efforts are unsuccessful, our growth may be limited and we may suffer financial or reputational harm that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.Our financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings, including antitrust, tax, environmental, or other matters.We are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. While we seek to limit our liability in our commercial contractual arrangements, there are no guarantees that each contract will contain suitable limitations of liability or that limitations of liability will be enforceable. Also, the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to predict reliably. Various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables, where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments, or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in any particular period.16Table of ContentsCosts and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results.We are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions in the air; discharges to land and water; and the generation, handling, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. We take our environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of adverse environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and in the transportation of our products. Future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures. In addition, laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment, compliance, and remediation. These additional costs may adversely affect our financial results. For a more detailed description of these matters, see Item 1, Business–Environmental Regulation, above.A change of tax law in key jurisdictions could result in a material increase in our tax expense.The multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.Changes to income tax laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, or in the interpretation of such laws, could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Various levels of government, including the U.S. federal government, are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue. Further changes in tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.General Risk Factors
 Catastrophic events could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers, having a negative impact on our business, financial results, and cash flows.Our operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside our control, including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, storms, epidemics, pandemics, acts of war, and terrorism. Any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect our ability to produce and distribute products and possibly expose us to third-party liability claims. Additionally, such events could impact our suppliers, customers, and partners, which could cause energy and raw materials to be unavailable to us, or our customers to be unable to purchase or accept our products and services. Any such occurrence could have a negative impact on our operations and financial results.Inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance.We face strong competition from large global competitors and many smaller regional competitors in many of our business segments. Introduction by competitors of new technologies, competing products, or additional capacity could weaken demand for, or impact pricing of our products, negatively impacting financial results. In addition, competitors’ pricing policies could affect our profitability or market share"

Our operations are affected by various risks, many of which are beyond our control. In evaluating investment in the Company and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or presented elsewhere from time to time, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made and could adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. The risks described below are not all inclusive but are designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. In addition to such risks, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business, performance, or financial condition in the future that are not presently known, are not currently believed to be significant, or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses.Risks Related to Economic ConditionsThe COVID-19 global pandemic may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.The COVID-19 global pandemic, including resurgences and variants of the virus that causes COVID-19, and efforts to reduce its spread have led, and may continue to lead to, significant changes in levels of economic activity and significant disruption and volatility in global markets. These factors have led, and may continue to lead, to reduced demand for industrial gas products, particularly in our merchant business. In addition, COVID-19 may result in reduced sales in our other businesses, lower returns for certain of our projects, and the potential delay or cancellation of certain projects in our pipeline. These effects may be exacerbated by actions by health or other governmental authorities to attempt to reduce the transmission of COVID-19.10Table of ContentsFurther, to the extent COVID-19 adversely affects our business, financial condition, and results of operations and global economic conditions more generally, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein.Changes in global and regional economic conditions, the markets we serve, or the financial markets may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.Unfavorable conditions in the global economy or regional economies, the markets we serve or financial markets may decrease the demand for our goods and services and adversely impact our revenues, operating results, and cash flows.Demand for our products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which we do business. Weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past, including most recently due to COVID-19, and may do so in the future. In addition, our growth strategy is largely based on demand for technologies and projects that limit the impact of global climate change. Demand for our solutions could be negatively impacted if public and private actors reduce their focus on reducing carbon emissions. Reduced demand for our products and services would have a negative impact on our revenues and earnings. In addition, reduced demand could depress sales, reduce our margins, constrain our operating flexibility or reduce efficient utilization of our manufacturing capacity, or result in charges which are unusual or nonrecurring. Excess capacity in our manufacturing facilities or those of our competitors could decrease our ability to maintain pricing and generate profits.In addition, our operating results in one or more segments may be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic conditions for particular customer markets within a segment. A decline in the industries served by our customers or adverse events or circumstances affecting individual customers can reduce demand for our products and services and impair the ability of such customers to satisfy their obligations to us, resulting in uncollected receivables, unanticipated contract terminations, project delays or the inability to recover plant investments, any of which may negatively impact our financial results.Weak overall demand or specific customer conditions may also cause customer shutdowns or defaults or otherwise make us unable to operate facilities profitably and may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment or prevent projects from coming on-stream when expected. These or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific market, product, or customer events may require us to record an impairment on tangible assets, such as facilities and equipment, or intangible assets, such as intellectual property or goodwill, which would have a negative impact on our financial results.Our extensive international operations can be adversely impacted by operational, economic, political, security, legal, and currency translation risks that could decrease profitability.In fiscal year 2022, over 60% of our sales were derived from customers outside the United States and many of our operations, suppliers, and employees are located outside the United States. Our operations in foreign jurisdictions may be subject to risks including exchange control regulations, import and trade restrictions, trade policy and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting U.S. companies doing business abroad. Changing economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions, strained relations between countries, or the imposition of tariffs or international sanctions can cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.11Table of ContentsOur growth strategies depend in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the United States, particularly in markets such as China, India, Indonesia, and the Middle East, and involve significantly larger and more complex projects, including gasification and large-scale hydrogen projects, some in regions where there is the potential for significant economic and political disruptions. We are actively investing large amounts of capital and other resources, in some cases through joint ventures, in developing markets, which we believe to have high growth potential. Our operations in these markets may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies, including political and economic instability, project delay or abandonment due to unanticipated government actions, inadequate investment in infrastructure, undeveloped property rights and legal systems, unfamiliar regulatory environments, relationships with local partners, language and cultural differences and increased difficulty recruiting, training and retaining qualified employees. In addition, our properties and contracts in these locations may be subject to seizure and cancellation, respectively, without full compensation for loss. Successful operation of particular facilities or execution of projects may be disrupted by civil unrest, acts of war, sabotage or terrorism, and other local security concerns. Such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or require us to shut down operations for a period of time.Furthermore, because the majority of our revenue is generated from sales outside the United States, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our business is primarily exposed to translational currency risk as the results of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates throughout the fiscal period. Our policy is to minimize cash flow volatility from changes in currency exchange rates. We choose not to hedge the translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ earnings into dollars. Accordingly, reported sales, net earnings, cash flows, and fair values have been, and in the future will be, affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. For a more detailed discussion of currency exposure, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, below.Risks Related to Our BusinessRisks related to the approval, execution, and operation of our projects, particularly with respect to our largest projects, may adversely affect our operations or financial results.A significant and growing portion of our business involves clean hydrogen, carbon capture, gasification, and other large-scale projects that involve challenging engineering, procurement and construction phases that may last several years and involve the investment of billions of dollars. These projects are technically complex, often reliant on significant interaction with government authorities and face significant financing, development, operational and reputational risks. These projects may also be subject to complex government approvals, as well as legal or regulatory challenges by government authorities or third parties. Delays in receiving required approvals or related to litigation could require us to delay or abandon certain projects, which may result in the incurrence of additional expense, the loss of invested proceeds and reputational damage.We may encounter difficulties in engineering, delays in designs or materials provided by the customer or a third party, equipment and materials delivery delays, schedule changes, customer scope changes, delays related to obtaining regulatory permits and rights-of-way, inability to find adequate sources of labor in the locations where we are building new plants, weather-related delays, delays by customers' contractors in completing their portion of a project, technical or transportation difficulties, cost overruns, supply difficulties, geopolitical risks and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, that may impact our ability to complete a project within the original delivery schedule. In some cases, delays and additional costs may be substantial, and we may be required to cancel a project and/or compensate the customer for the delay. We may not be able to recover any of these costs. In addition, in some cases we seek financing for large projects and face market risk associated with the availability and terms of such financing. These financing arrangements may require that we comply with certain performance requirements which, if not met, could result in default and restructuring costs or other losses. All of these factors could also negatively impact our reputation or relationships with our customers, suppliers and other third parties, any of which could adversely affect our ability to secure new projects in the future.The operation of our facilities, pipelines, and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control, such as pipeline leaks and ruptures, fire, explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures, vehicle accidents, or cyber incidents. If operational risks materialize, they could result in loss of life, damage to the environment, or loss of production, all of which could negatively impact our ongoing operations, reputation, financial results, and cash flows. In addition, our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities and our ability to meet customer requirements, which depend, in part, on our ability to properly maintain and replace aging assets.12Table of ContentsWe are subject to extensive government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Regulations addressing, among other things, import/export restrictions, anti-bribery and corruption, and taxes, can negatively impact our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.We are subject to government regulation in the United States and in the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business. The application of laws and regulations to our business is sometimes unclear. Compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that could result in reduced profitability. If there is a determination that we have failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations, we may be subject to penalties or sanctions that could adversely impact our reputation and financial results. Compliance with changes in laws or regulations can result in increased operating costs and require additional, unplanned capital expenditures. Export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent us from shipping our products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so. Changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of our businesses. Increasingly aggressive enforcement of anti-bribery and anti-corruption requirements, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act and the China Anti-Unfair Competition Law, could subject us to criminal or civil sanctions if a violation is deemed to have occurred. In addition, we are subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit us, or certain of our affiliates, from doing business in certain countries, or restricting the kind of business that we may conduct. Such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who are not subject to comparable restrictions or prevent us from taking advantage of growth opportunities.Further, we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents, business partners or that businesses that we acquire would not violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering, and data privacy. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.We may be unable to successfully identify, execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, manage our joint ventures, or effectively disentangle divested businesses.Our ability to grow revenue, earnings, and cash flow at anticipated rates depends in part on our ability to identify, successfully acquire and integrate businesses and assets at appropriate prices, and realize expected growth, synergies, and operating efficiencies. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by the failure of acquired businesses or assets to meet expected returns, the failure to integrate acquired businesses, the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions, and the discovery of unanticipated liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses or assets for which we lack adequate contractual protections or insurance. In addition, we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that do not meet expectations.In addition, some of our largest projects involve joint ventures. These arrangements may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including our ability to cooperate with our strategic partners, our strategic partners having interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and the potential that our strategic partners may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations to the joint venture, which may negatively impact the expected benefits of the joint venture and cause us to incur additional expense or suffer reputational damage. In addition, due to the nature of these arrangements, we may have limited ability to direct or influence the management of the joint venture, which may limit our ability to assist and oversee the design and implementation of the joint venture’s business as well as its accounting, legal, governance, human resources, information technology, and other administrative systems. This may expose us to additional risks and uncertainties because we may be dependent upon and subject to liability, losses, or reputational damage relating to systems, controls, and personnel that are not under our control. These risks may be augmented when the joint venture is operating outside the United States due to differences in language, culture, and regulation, as well as the factors listed above that are relevant to our international operations.13Table of ContentsWe continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. These transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements. For example, when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated time frame or at all. In addition, divestitures or other dispositions may dilute our earnings per share, have other adverse financial and accounting impacts, distract management, and give rise to disputes with buyers. In addition, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to indemnify buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities. Our financial results could be impacted adversely by claims under these indemnification provisions.The security of our information technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect our ability to operate.We depend on information technology to enable us to operate safely and efficiently and interface with our customers as well as to maintain our internal control environment and financial reporting accuracy and efficiency. Our information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and external services and service providers. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, property damage, or the loss of or damage to our confidential business information due to a security breach. In addition, our information technology systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Security breaches of our systems (or the systems of our customers, suppliers or other business partners) could result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, and may subject us to legal liability.As with most large systems, our information technology systems have in the past been, and in the future likely will be subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks, and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase. To date, we are not aware of any significant impact on our operations or financial results from such attempts; however, unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations, result in the loss of assets, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could: interrupt our operations at one or more sites; delay production and shipments; result in the theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets; damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation; result in defective products or services, physical damage to facilities, pipelines or delivery systems, including those we own or operate for third parties, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws, or increased costs for security and remediation; or raise concerns regarding our internal control environment and internal control over financial reporting. Each of these consequences could adversely affect our business, reputation and our financial statements.Our business involves the use, storage, and transmission of information about our employees, vendors, and customers. The protection of such information, as well as our proprietary information, is critical to us. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. We have established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information. We also, from time to time, export sensitive customer data and technical information to recipients outside the United States. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, which could ultimately result in litigation and potential legal and financial liability. These events could also damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business.14Table of ContentsInterruption in ordinary sources of raw material or energy supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability.Hydrocarbons, including natural gas, are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas. Energy, including electricity, natural gas, and diesel fuel for delivery trucks, is the largest cost component of our business. Because our industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity, inflation and energy price fluctuations could materially impact our revenues and earnings. A disruption in the supply of energy, components, or raw materials, whether due to market conditions, legislative or regulatory actions, the COVID-19 pandemic, natural events, or other disruption, could prevent us from meeting our contractual commitments and harm our business and financial results.Our supply of crude helium for purification and resale is largely dependent upon natural gas production by crude helium suppliers. Lower natural gas production resulting from natural gas pricing dynamics, supplier operating or transportation issues, or other interruptions in sales from crude helium suppliers, can reduce our supplies of crude helium available for processing and resale to customers.We typically contract to pass-through cost increases in energy and raw materials to customers, but such cost pass-through results in declining margins, and cost variability can negatively impact our other operating results. For example, we may be unable to raise prices as quickly as costs rise, or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery of such costs. In addition, increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons may negatively impact our revenues and earnings. Even where costs are passed through, price increases can cause lower sales volume.New technologies create performance risks that could impact our financial results or reputation.We are continually developing and implementing new technologies and product offerings. Existing technologies are being implemented in products and designs or at scales beyond our experience base. These technological expansions can create nontraditional performance risks to our operations. Failure of the technologies to work as predicted, or unintended consequences of new designs or uses, could lead to cost overruns, project delays, financial penalties, or damage to our reputation. We may face difficulties marketing products produced using new technologies including, but not limited to, green hydrogen, which may adversely impact our sales and financial results. In addition, certain large-scale projects may contain processes or technologies that we have not operated at the same scale or in the same combination, and although such projects generally include technologies and processes that have been demonstrated previously by others, such technologies or processes may be new to us and may introduce new risks to our operations. Additionally, there is also a risk that our new technologies may become obsolete and replaced by other market alternatives. Performance difficulties on these larger projects may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. In addition, performance challenges may adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain future contracts.Protecting our intellectual property is critical to our technological development and we may suffer competitive harm from infringement on such rights. As we develop new technologies, it is critical that we protect our intellectual property assets against third-party infringement. We own a number of patents and other forms of intellectual property related to our products and services. As we develop new technologies there is a risk that our patent applications may not be granted, or we may not receive sufficient protection of our proprietary interests. We may also expend considerable resources in defending our patents against third-party infringement. It is critical that we protect our proprietary interests to prevent competitive harm. Legal and Regulatory RisksLegislative, regulatory, societal, and market efforts to address global climate change may impact our business and create financial risk.We are the world’s leading supplier of hydrogen, the primary use of which is the production of ultra-low sulfur transportation fuels that have significantly reduced transportation emissions and helped improve human health. To make the high volumes of hydrogen needed by our customers, we use steam methane reforming, which produces carbon dioxide. In addition, gasification enables the conversion of lower value feedstocks into cleaner energy and value-added products; however, our gasification projects also produce carbon dioxide. Some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing GHG emissions, including CO2, which may lead to direct and indirect costs on our operations. Furthermore, some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions, which often result in higher power costs. 15Table of ContentsIncreased public concern and governmental action may result in more international, U.S. federal and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG emissions or increased demand for technologies and projects to limit the impact of global climate change. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production and application of our gasification technology. We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the long-term impact these measures will have on our operations. Any legislation or governmental action that limits or taxes GHG emissions could negatively impact our growth, increase our operating costs, or reduce demand for certain of our products.Our operations may present a safety risk to our employees.Notwithstanding our emphasis on the safety of our employees and contractors and the precautions we take related to health and safety, we may be unable to avoid safety incidents relating to our operations that result in injuries or deaths. Certain safety incidents may result in legal or regulatory action that could result in increased expenses or reputational damage. We maintain workers' compensation insurance to address the risk of incurring material liabilities for injuries or deaths, but there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could result in material liabilities to us for any injuries or deaths. Changes to federal, state, and local employee health and safety regulations, and legislative, regulatory, or societal responses to safety incidents may result in heightened regulations or public scrutiny that may increase our compliance costs or result in reputational damage.Our financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings, including antitrust, tax, environmental, or other matters.We are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. While we seek to limit our liability in our commercial contractual arrangements, there are no guarantees that each contract will contain suitable limitations of liability or that limitations of liability will be enforceable. Also, the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to predict reliably. Various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables, where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments, or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in any particular period.Costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results.We are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions in the air; discharges to land and water; and the generation, handling, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. We take our environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of adverse environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and in the transportation of our products. Future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures. In addition, laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment, compliance, and remediation. These additional costs may adversely affect our financial results. For a more detailed description of these matters, see Item 1, Business–Environmental Regulation, above.A change of tax law in key jurisdictions could result in a material increase in our tax expense.The multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.Changes to income tax laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, or in the interpretation of such laws, could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Various levels of government, including the U.S. federal government, are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue. Further changes in tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.16Table of ContentsGeneral Risk Factors
 Catastrophic events could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers, having a negative impact on our business, financial results, and cash flows.Our operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside our control, including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, storms, epidemics, pandemics, acts of war, and terrorism. Any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect our ability to produce and distribute products and possibly expose us to third-party liability claims. Additionally, such events could impact our suppliers, customers, and partners, which could cause energy and raw materials to be unavailable to us, or our customers to be unable to purchase or accept our products and services. Any such occurrence could have a negative impact on our operations and financial results.The United Kingdom’s (“UK”) exit from European Union (“EU”) membership could adversely affect our European Operations. Although the UK’s exit from EU membership on 31 January 2021 (""Brexit"") did not result in material disruptions to customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers, or our European business, the ultimate effects of Brexit on us are still difficult to predict. Adverse consequences from Brexit may include greater restrictions on imports and exports between the UK and EU members and increased regulatory complexities. Any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers, and our European business overall.Inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance.We face strong competition from large global competitors and many smaller regional competitors in many of our business segments. Introduction by competitors of new technologies, competing products, or additional capacity could weaken demand for, or impact pricing of our products, negatively impacting financial results. In addition, competitors’ pricing policies could affect our profitability or market share"

.Our operations are affected by various risks, many of which are beyond our control. In evaluating investment in the Company and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or presented elsewhere from time to time, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made and could adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. The risks described below are not all inclusive but are designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. In addition to such risks, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business, performance, or financial condition in the future that are not presently known, are not currently believed to be significant, or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses.Risks Related to Economic ConditionsThe COVID-19 global pandemic may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.The COVID-19 global pandemic, including resurgences and variants of the virus that causes COVID-19, and efforts to reduce its spread have led, and may continue to lead to, significant changes in levels of economic activity and significant disruption and volatility in global markets. These factors have led, and may continue to lead, to reduced demand for industrial gas products, particularly in our merchant business. In addition, COVID-19 may result in reduced sales in our other businesses, lower returns for certain of our projects, and the potential delay or cancellation of certain projects in our pipeline.In addition, we are monitoring the health of our employees and many of our employees, including those based at our headquarters, are working remotely in accordance with health safety guidance and applicable governmental orders. Action by health or other governmental authorities requiring the closure of our facilities, recommending other physical distancing measures, or mandating vaccination against COVID-19 could negatively impact our business and those of our service providers and customers. Although we have business continuity and other safeguards in place, we cannot be certain that they will be fully effective for extended periods of time.10Table of ContentsAs the pandemic and responses to it continue to evolve we may experience further adverse impacts on our operations, and our ability to access capital on favorable terms, or at all, may be impaired. In addition, we may face unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products when restrictions on business and travel end. If demand for our products exceeds our capacity, it could adversely affect our financial results and customer relationships. Although the duration and ultimate impact of these factors is unknown at this time, the decline in economic conditions due to COVID-19, or another disease-causing similar impacts, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and such impact may be material.Further, to the extent COVID-19 adversely affects our business, financial condition, and results of operations and global economic conditions more generally, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein.Changes in global and regional economic conditions, the markets we serve, or the financial markets may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.Unfavorable conditions in the global economy or regional economies, the markets we serve or financial markets may decrease the demand for our goods and services and adversely impact our revenues, operating results, and cash flows.Demand for our products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which we do business. Weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past, including most recently due to COVID-19, and may do so in the future. Reduced demand for our products and services would have a negative impact on our revenues and earnings. In addition, reduced demand could depress sales, reduce our margins, constrain our operating flexibility or reduce efficient utilization of our manufacturing capacity, or result in charges which are unusual or nonrecurring. Excess capacity in our manufacturing facilities or those of our competitors could decrease our ability to maintain pricing and generate profits.In addition, our operating results in one or more segments may be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic conditions for particular customer markets within a segment. A decline in the industries served by our customers or adverse events or circumstances affecting individual customers can reduce demand for our products and services and impair the ability of such customers to satisfy their obligations to us, resulting in uncollected receivables, unanticipated contract terminations, project delays or the inability to recover plant investments, any of which may negatively impact our financial results.Weak overall demand or specific customer conditions may also cause customer shutdowns or defaults or otherwise make us unable to operate facilities profitably and may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment or prevent projects from coming on-stream when expected. These or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific market, product, or customer events may require us to record an impairment on tangible assets, such as facilities and equipment, or intangible assets, such as intellectual property or goodwill, which would have a negative impact on our financial results.Our extensive international operations can be adversely impacted by operational, economic, political, security, legal, and currency translation risks that could decrease profitability.In fiscal year 2021, over 60% of our sales were derived from customers outside the United States and many of our operations, suppliers, and employees are located outside the United States. Our operations in foreign jurisdictions may be subject to risks including exchange control regulations, import and trade restrictions, trade policy and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting U.S. companies doing business abroad. Changing economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions, strained relations between countries, or the imposition of tariffs or international sanctions can cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.11Table of ContentsOur growth strategies depend in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the United States, particularly in markets such as China, India, Indonesia, and the Middle East, and involve significantly larger and more complex projects, including gasification and large-scale hydrogen projects, some in regions where there is the potential for significant economic and political disruptions. We are actively investing large amounts of capital and other resources, in some cases through joint ventures, in developing markets, which we believe to have high growth potential. Our operations in these markets may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies, including political and economic instability, project delay or abandonment due to unanticipated government actions, inadequate investment in infrastructure, undeveloped property rights and legal systems, unfamiliar regulatory environments, relationships with local partners, language and cultural differences and increased difficulty recruiting, training and retaining qualified employees. In addition, our properties and contracts in these locations may be subject to seizure and cancellation, respectively, without full compensation for loss. Successful operation of particular facilities or execution of projects may be disrupted by civil unrest, acts of war, sabotage or terrorism, and other local security concerns. Such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or require us to shut down operations for a period of time.Furthermore, because the majority of our revenue is generated from sales outside the United States, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our business is primarily exposed to translational currency risk as the results of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates throughout the fiscal period. Our policy is to minimize cash flow volatility from changes in currency exchange rates. We choose not to hedge the translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ earnings into dollars. Accordingly, reported sales, net earnings, cash flows, and fair values have been, and in the future will be, affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. For a more detailed discussion of currency exposure, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, below.Risks Related to Our BusinessOperational and project execution risks, particularly with respect to our largest projects, may adversely affect our operations or financial results.A significant and growing portion of our business involves gasification and other large-scale projects that involve challenging engineering, procurement and construction phases that may last up to several years and involve the investment of billions of dollars. These projects are technically complex, often reliant on significant interaction with government authorities and face significant financing, development, operational and reputational risks. We may encounter difficulties in engineering, delays in designs or materials provided by the customer or a third party, equipment and materials delivery delays, schedule changes, customer scope changes, delays related to obtaining regulatory permits and rights-of-way, inability to find adequate sources of labor in the locations where we are building new plants, weather-related delays, delays by customers' contractors in completing their portion of a project, technical or transportation difficulties, cost overruns, supply difficulties, geopolitical risks and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, that may impact our ability to complete a project within the original delivery schedule. In some cases, delays and additional costs may be substantial, and we may be required to cancel a project and/or compensate the customer for the delay. We may not be able to recover any of these costs. In addition, in some cases we seek financing for large projects and face market risk associated with the availability and terms of such financing. These financing arrangements may require that we comply with certain performance requirements which, if not met, could result in default and restructuring costs or other losses. All of these factors could also negatively impact our reputation or relationships with our customers, suppliers and other third parties, any of which could adversely affect our ability to secure new projects in the future.The operation of our facilities, pipelines, and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control, such as pipeline leaks and ruptures, fire, explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures, vehicle accidents, or cyber incidents. If operational risks materialize, they could result in loss of life, damage to the environment, or loss of production, all of which could negatively impact our ongoing operations, reputation, financial results, and cash flows. In addition, our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities and our ability to meet customer requirements, which depend, in part, on our ability to properly maintain and replace aging assets.12Table of ContentsWe are subject to extensive government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business.

Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.We may be unable to successfully identify, execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, or effectively disentangle divested businesses.Our ability to grow revenue, earnings, and cash flow at anticipated rates depends in part on our ability to identify, successfully acquire and integrate businesses and assets at appropriate prices, and realize expected growth, synergies, and operating efficiencies. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by the failure of acquired businesses or assets to meet expected returns, the failure to integrate acquired businesses, the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions, and the discovery of unanticipated liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses or assets for which we lack adequate contractual protections or insurance.

In addition, divestitures or other dispositions may dilute our earnings per share, have other adverse financial and accounting impacts, distract management, and give rise to disputes with buyers. In addition, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to indemnify buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities. Our financial results could be impacted adversely by claims under these indemnification provisions.13Table of ContentsThe security of our information technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect our ability to operate.We depend on information technology to enable us to operate safely and efficiently and interface with our customers as well as to maintain our internal control environment and financial reporting accuracy and efficiency. Our information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and external services and service providers. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, property damage, or the loss of or damage to our confidential business information due to a security breach. In addition, our information technology systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Security breaches of our systems (or the systems of our customers, suppliers or other business partners) could result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, and may subject us to legal liability.As with most large systems, our information technology systems have in the past been, and in the future likely will be subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks, and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase. To date, we are not aware of any significant impact on our operations or financial results from such attempts; however, unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations, result in the loss of assets, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could: interrupt our operations at one or more sites; delay production and shipments; result in the theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets; damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation; result in defective products or services, physical damage to facilities, pipelines or delivery systems, including those we own or operate for third parties, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws, or increased costs for security and remediation; or raise concerns regarding our internal control environment and internal control over financial reporting. Each of these consequences could adversely affect our business, reputation and our financial statements.Our business involves the use, storage, and transmission of information about our employees, vendors, and customers. The protection of such information, as well as our proprietary information, is critical to us. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. We have established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information. We also, from time to time, export sensitive customer data and technical information to recipients outside the United States. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, which could ultimately result in litigation and potential legal and financial liability. These events could also damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business.Interruption in ordinary sources of raw material or energy supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability.Hydrocarbons, including natural gas, are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas. Energy, including electricity, natural gas, and diesel fuel for delivery trucks, is the largest cost component of our business. Because our industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity, inflation and energy price fluctuations could materially impact our revenues and earnings. A disruption in the supply of energy, components, or raw materials, whether due to market conditions, legislative or regulatory actions, the COVID-19 pandemic, natural events, or other disruption, could prevent us from meeting our contractual commitments and harm our business and financial results.Our supply of crude helium for purification and resale is largely dependent upon natural gas production by crude helium suppliers. Lower natural gas production resulting from natural gas pricing dynamics, supplier operating or transportation issues, or other interruptions in sales from crude helium suppliers, can reduce our supplies of crude helium available for processing and resale to customers.14Table of ContentsWe typically contract to pass-through cost increases in energy and raw materials to customers, but such cost pass-through results in declining margins, and cost variability can negatively impact our other operating results. For example, we may be unable to raise prices as quickly as costs rise, or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery of such costs. In addition, increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons may negatively impact our revenues and earnings. Even where costs are passed through, price increases can cause lower sales volume.New technologies create performance risks that could impact our financial results or reputation.We are continually developing and implementing new technologies and product offerings. Existing technologies are being implemented in products and designs or at scales beyond our experience base. These technological expansions can create nontraditional performance risks to our operations. Failure of the technologies to work as predicted, or unintended consequences of new designs or uses, could lead to cost overruns, project delays, financial penalties, or damage to our reputation. In addition, gasification and other large-scale projects may contain processes or technologies that we have not operated at the same scale or in the same combination, and although such projects generally include technologies and processes that have been demonstrated previously by others, such technologies or processes may be new to us and may introduce new risks to our operations. Additionally, there is also a risk that our new technologies may become obsolete and replaced by other market alternatives. Performance difficulties on these larger projects may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. In addition, performance challenges may adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain future contracts for gasification projects.Protecting our intellectual property is critical to our technological development and we may suffer competitive harm from infringement on such rights. As we develop new technologies, it is critical that we protect our intellectual property assets against third-party infringement. We own a number of patents and other forms of intellectual property related to our products and services. As we develop new technologies there is a risk that our patent applications may not be granted, or we may not receive sufficient protection of our proprietary interests. We may also expend considerable resources in defending our patents against third-party infringement. It is critical that we protect our proprietary interests to prevent competitive harm. Legal and Regulatory RisksLegislative, regulatory, and societal responses to global climate change create financial risk.We are the world’s leading supplier of hydrogen, the primary use of which is the production of ultra-low sulfur transportation fuels that have significantly reduced transportation emissions and helped improve human health. To make the high volumes of hydrogen needed by our customers, we use steam methane reforming, which produces carbon dioxide. In addition, gasification enables the conversion of lower value feedstocks into cleaner energy and value-added products; however, our gasification projects also produce carbon dioxide. Some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing GHG emissions, including CO2, which may lead to direct and indirect costs on our operations. Furthermore, some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions, which often result in higher power costs. Increased public concern and governmental action may result in more international, U.S. federal and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG emissions. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production and application of our gasification technology. We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the long-term impact these measures will have on our operations. Any legislation or governmental action that limits or taxes GHG emissions could negatively impact our growth, increase our operating costs, or reduce demand for certain of our products.15Table of ContentsOur financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings, including antitrust, tax, environmental, or other matters.We are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. While we seek to limit our liability in our commercial contractual arrangements, there are no guarantees that each contract will contain suitable limitations of liability or that limitations of liability will be enforceable. Also, the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to predict reliably. Various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables, where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments, or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in any particular period.Costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results.We are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions in the air; discharges to land and water; and the generation, handling, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. We take our environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of adverse environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and in the transportation of our products. Future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures. In addition, laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment, compliance, and remediation. These additional costs may adversely affect our financial results. For a more detailed description of these matters, see Item 1, Business–Environmental Regulation, above.A change of tax law in key jurisdictions could result in a material increase in our tax expense.The multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.Changes to income tax laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, or in the interpretation of such laws, could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Various levels of government, including the U.S. federal government, are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue. Further changes in tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.General Risk Factors
 Catastrophic events could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers, having a negative impact on our business, financial results, and cash flows.Our operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside our control, including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, storms, epidemics, pandemics, acts of war, and terrorism. Any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect our ability to produce and distribute products and possibly expose us to third-party liability claims. Additionally, such events could impact our suppliers, customers, and partners, which could cause energy and raw materials to be unavailable to us, or our customers to be unable to purchase or accept our products and services. Any such occurrence could have a negative impact on our operations and financial results.16Table of ContentsThe United Kingdom’s (“UK”) exit from European Union (“EU”) membership could adversely affect our European Operations. Although the UK’s exit from EU membership on 31 January 2021 (""Brexit"") did not result in material disruptions to customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers, or our European business, the ultimate effects of Brexit on us are still difficult to predict. Adverse consequences from Brexit may include greater restrictions on imports and exports between the UK and EU members and increased regulatory complexities. Any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers, and our European business overall.Inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance.We face strong competition from large global competitors and many smaller regional competitors in many of our business segments. Introduction by competitors of new technologies, competing products, or additional capacity could weaken demand for, or impact pricing of our products, negatively impacting financial results. In addition, competitors’ pricing policies could affect our profitability or market share"

0,APD,AIR PRODUCTS & CHEMICALS INC,2009-11-25,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSThe Company operates in over 40 countries around the world and faces a variety of risks anduncertainties that could materially affect its future operations and financial performance. Many ofthese risks and uncertainties are not within the Companys control. Risks that may significantlyimpact the Company include the following:Overall Economic ConditionsWeak general economic conditions in markets in which the Company doesbusiness may decrease the demand for its goods and services and adversely impact its revenues,operating results, and cash flow.Demand for the Companys products and services depends in part on the general economic conditionsaffecting the countries and industries in which the Company does business. Currently, weak economicconditions in the U.S. and other countries and in industries served by the Company have impactedand may continue to impact demand for the Companys products and services, in turn negativelyimpacting the Companys revenues and earnings. Excess capacity in the Companys or its competitorsmanufacturing facilities could decrease the Companys ability to generate profits. Unanticipatedcontract terminations or project delays by current customers can also negatively impact financialresults. In addition, the length and severity of the economic downturn have increased the risk ofpotential bankruptcy of customers and potential losses from accounts receivable.Asset ImpairmentsThe Company may be required to record impairment on its long-lived assets.Weakdemand may cause underutilization of the Companys manufacturing capacity or elimination of productlines; contract terminations or customer shutdowns may force sale or abandonment of facilities andequipment; contractual provisions may allow customer buyout of facilities or equipment; or otherevents associated with weak economic conditions or specific product or customer events may requirethe Company to record an impairment on tangible assets, such as facilities and equipment, as wellas intangible assets, such as intellectual property or goodwill, which would have a negative impacton its financial results.CompetitionInability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales andfinancial performance.The Company faces strong competition from several large, global competitors and many smallerregional ones in all of its business segments. Introduction by competitors of new technologies,competing products, or additional capacity could weaken demand for or impact pricing of theCompanys products, negatively impacting financial results. In addition, competitors pricingpolicies could materially affect the Companys profitability or its market share.9Table of ContentsRaw Material and Energy Cost and AvailabilityInterruption in ordinary sources of supply or aninability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lostsales or reduced profitability.Energy, including electricity, natural gas, and diesel fuel for delivery trucks, is the largestcost component of the Companys business. Because the Companys industrial gas facilities usesubstantial amounts of electricity, energy price fluctuations could materially impact the Companysrevenues and earnings. Hydrocarbons, including natural gas, are the primary feedstock for theproduction of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and synthesis gas. The Electronics and PerformanceMaterials segment uses a wide variety of raw materials, including alcohols, ethyleneamines,cyclohexamine, acrylonitriles, and glycols. Shortages or price escalation in these materials couldnegatively impact financial results. A disruption in the supply of energy and raw materials,whether due to market conditions, natural events, or other disruption, could prevent the Companyfrom meeting its contractual commitments, harming its business and financial results.The Company typically contracts to pass through cost increases in energy and raw materials to itscustomers, but cost variability can still have a negative impact on its results. The Company maynot be able to raise prices as quickly as costs rise, or competitive pressures may prevent fullrecovery. Increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers forcompetitive or other reasons would negatively impact the Companys revenues and earnings. Evenwhere costs are passed through, price increases can cause lower sales volume.Regulatory ComplianceThe Company is subject to extensive government regulation in jurisdictionsaround the globe in which it does business. Changes in regulations addressing, among other things,environmental compliance, import/export restrictions, and taxes, can negatively impact theCompanys operations and financial results.The Company is subject to government regulation in the United States and foreign jurisdictions inwhich it conducts its business. The application of laws and regulations to the Companys businessis sometimes unclear. Compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or requirechanges in business practice that could result in reduced profitability. Determination ofnoncompliance can result in penalties or sanctions that could also impact financial results.Compliance with changes in laws or regulations can require additional capital expenditures orincrease operating costs. Export controls or other regulatoryrestrictions could prevent the Company fromshipping its products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so. Changes in taxlaws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of theCompanys businesses.Greenhouse GasesLegislative and regulatory responses to global climate change create financialrisk.Some of the Companys operations are within jurisdictions that have, or are developing, regulatoryregimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). These include existing and expandingcoverage under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme; mandatory reporting and reductions atmanufacturing facilities in Alberta, Canada; and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints onGHG emissions in California and Ontario. In addition, increased public awareness and concern mayresult in more international, U.S. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate theeffects of GHG. Although uncertain, these developments could increase the Companys costs relatedto consumption of electric power, hydrogen production, and fluorinated gases production. TheCompany believes it will be able to mitigate some of the potential increased cost through itscontractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements preventsaccurate estimate of the long-term impact on the Company. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHGemissions could impact the Companys growth, increase its operating costs, or reduce demand forcertain of its products.Environmental ComplianceCosts and expenses resulting from compliance with environmentalregulations may negatively impact the Companys operations and financial results.The Company is subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safetylaws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions in the air, discharges to land andwater, and the generation, handling, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste and othermaterials. The Company takes its environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a riskof environmental impact inherent in its manufacturing operations. Future developments and morestringent environmental regulations may require the Company to make additional unforeseenenvironmental expenditures. In addition, laws and regulations may require significant expendituresfor environmental protection equipment, compliance, and remediation. These additional costs mayadversely affect10Table of Contentsfinancial results. For a more detailed description of these matters, see Narrative Description ofthe Companys Business GenerallyEnvironmental Controls, above.Foreign Operations, Political, and Legal RisksThe Companys foreign operations can be adverselyimpacted by nationalization or expropriation of property, undeveloped property rights, and legalsystems or political instability.The Companys operations in certain foreign jurisdictions are subject to nationalization andexpropriation risk, and some of its contractual relationships within these jurisdictions aresubject to cancellation without full compensation for loss. Economic and political conditionswithin foreign jurisdictions, social unrest or strained relations between countries can causefluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property. The occurrenceof any of these risks could have a material, adverse impact on the Companys operations andfinancial results.Interest Rate IncreasesThe Companys earnings, cash flow, and financial position can be impactedby interest rate increases.At 30 September 2009, the Company had total consolidated debt of approximately $4,501.5 million, ofwhich approximately $785.9 million will mature in the next twelve months. The Company expects tocontinue to incur indebtedness to fund new projects and replace maturing debt. Although the Companyactively manages its interest rate risk through the use of derivatives and diversified debtobligations, not all borrowings at variable rates are hedged, and new debt will be priced at marketrates. If interest rates increase, the Companys interest expense could increase significantly,affecting earnings and reducing cash flow available for working capital, capital expenditures,acquisitions, and other purposes. In addition, changes by any rating agency to the Companysoutlook or credit ratings could increase the Companys cost of borrowing.Currency FluctuationsChanges in foreign currencies may adversely affect the Companys financialresults.Asubstantial amount of the Companys sales are derived fromoutside the United States and denominated in foreign currencies. The Company also hassignificant production facilities which are located outside of the United States. Financial resultstherefore will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. The Company uses certain financialinstruments to mitigate these effects, but it is not cost-effective to hedge foreign currencyexposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rateson earnings, cash flows, and fair values of assets and liabilities. Accordingly, reported sales,net earnings, cash flows, and fair values have been and in the future will be affected by changesin foreign exchange rates. For a more detailed discussion of currency exposure, see Item 7A, below.Pension LiabilitiesThe Companys results of operations and financial condition could benegatively impacted by its U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans.Adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets have had and may continue tohave an unfavorable impact on the value of the Companys pension trust assets and its futureestimated pension liabilities. As a result, the Companys financial results in any period could benegatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the Companycould be required to provide increased pension plan funding, which could negatively impact theCompanys financial flexibility. For information about potential impacts from pension funding andthe use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters, see the discussion in Note 15 to theConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, below.Catastrophic EventsCatastrophic events could disrupt the Companys operations or the operationsof its suppliers or customers, having a negative impact on the Companys business, financialresults, and cash flow.The Companys operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside the Companys control,including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and storms; healthepidemics and pandemics; or acts of war and terrorism. Any such event could cause a seriousbusiness disruption that could affect the Companys ability to produce and distribute its productsand possibly expose it to third-party liability claims. Additionally, such events could impact theCompanys suppliers, in which event energy and raw materials may be unavailable to the Company, orits customers may be unable to purchase or accept the Companys products and services. Any suchoccurrence could have a negative impact on the Companys operations and financial results.11Table of ContentsOperational RisksOperational and execution risks may adversely affect the Companys operations orfinancial results.The Companys operation of its facilities, pipelines, and delivery systems inherently entailshazards that require continuous oversight and control, such as pipeline leaks and ruptures, fire,explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures, or vehicle accidents. If operational risksmaterialize, they could result in loss of life, damage to the environment, or loss of production,all of which could negatively impact the Companys ongoing operations, financial results, and cashflow. In addition, the Companys operating results are dependent on the continued operation of itsproduction facilities and its ability to meet customer requirements. Insufficient capacity mayexpose the Company to liabilities related to contract commitments. Operating results are alsodependent on the Companys ability to complete new construction projects on time, on budget, and inaccordance with performance requirements. Failure to do so may exposethe Company  to loss ofrevenue, potential litigation, and loss of business reputation.Information SecurityThe security of the Companys Information Technology systems could becompromised, which could adversely affect its ability to operate.The Company utilizes a global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and other technologies forthe distribution of information both within the Company and to customers and suppliers. The ERPsystem and other technologies are potentially vulnerable to interruption from viruses, hackers, orsystem breakdown. To mitigate these risks, the Company has implemented a variety of securitymeasures, including virus protection, redundancy procedures, and recovery processes. A significantsystem interruption, however, could materially affect the Companys operations, businessreputation, and financial results.Litigation and Regulatory ProceedingsThe Companys financial results may be affected by variouslegal and regulatory proceedings, including those involving antitrust, environmental, or othermatters.The Company is subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings in the normal course of businessand could become subject to additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. Theoutcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from the Companys expectations because theoutcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict.Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities andrelated insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously notsusceptible to reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, asignificant settlement, significant regulatory developments, or changes in applicable law. A futureadverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have amaterial adverse effect on the Companys results of operations in any particular period. For a moredetailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the Company,see  Item 3, below.Recruiting and Retaining EmployeesInability to attract, retain, or develop skilled employeescould adversely impact the Companys business.Sustaining and growing the Companys business depends on the recruitment, development, andretention of qualified employees. Demographic trends and changes in the geographic concentration ofglobal businesses have created more competition for talent. The inability to attract, develop, orretain quality employees could negatively impact the Companys ability to take on new projects andsustain its operations, which might adversely affect the Companys operations or its ability togrow.Portfolio ManagementThe success of portfolio management activities is not predictable.The Company continuously reviews and manages its portfolio of assets in order to maximize value forits shareholders. Portfolio management involves many variables, including future acquisitions anddivestitures, restructurings and resegmentations, and cost-cutting and productivity initiatives.The timing, impact, and ability to complete such undertakings, the costs and financial chargesassociated with such activities, and the ultimate financial impact of such undertakings areuncertain and can have a negative short- or long-term impact on the Companys operations andfinancial results"

Any suchoccurrence could have a negative impact on the Companys operations and financial results.Operational Risks  Operational and execution risks may adversely affect the Companys operationsor financial results.The Companys operation of its facilities, pipelines and delivery systems inherently entailshazards that require continuous oversight and control, such as pipeline leaks and ruptures, fire,explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures or vehicle accidents. If operational risksmaterialize, they could result in loss of life, damage to the environment or loss of production,all of which could negatively impact the Companys on-going operations, financial results and cashflow. The Companys operating results are dependent on the continued operation of its productionfacilities and its ability to meet customer requirements. Insufficient capacity may expose theCompany to liabilities related to contract commitments. Operating results are also dependent on theCompanys ability to complete new construction projects on time, on budget and in accordance withperformance requirements. Failure to do so may expose the business to loss of revenue, potentiallitigation and loss of business reputation.Information Security  The security of the Companys information technology systems could becompromised, which could adversely affect its ability to operate.The Company utilizes a global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and other technologies forthe distribution of information both within the Company and to customers and suppliers. The ERPsystem and other technologies are potentially vulnerable to interruption from viruses, hackers orsystem breakdown. To mitigate these risks, the Company has implemented a variety of securitymeasures, including virus protection, a state of the art data center, redundancy procedures9Table of Contentsand recovery processes. A significant system interruption, however, could materially affect theCompanys operations, business reputation and financial results.Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings  The Companys financial results may be affected by variouslegal and regulatory proceedings, including those involving antitrust, environmental or othermatters.The Company is subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings in the normal course of businessand could become subject to additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. Theoutcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from the Companys expectations because theoutcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict.Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities andrelated insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously notsusceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, asignificant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A futureadverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have amaterial adverse effect on the Companys results of operations in any particular period. For a moredetailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the Company, see Note 19to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 below.Recruiting and Retaining Employees  Inability to attract, retain or develop skilled employeescould adversely impact the Companys business.Sustaining and growing the Companys business depend on the recruitment, development andretention of qualified employees. Demographic trends and changes in the geographic concentration ofglobal businesses have created more competition for talent. The inability to attract, develop orretain quality employees could negatively impact the Companys ability to take on new projects andsustain its operations which might adversely affect the Companys operations or its ability togrow.PortfolioManagement  The success of portfolio management activities isnot predictableThe Company continuously reviews and manages its portfolio of assets in order to maximize value for itsshareholders. Portfolio management involves many variables, including future acquisitions anddivestitures, restructurings and resegmentations and cost-cutting and productivity initiatives. Thetiming, impact and ability to complete such undertakings, the costs and financial chargesassociated with such activities and the ultimate financial impact ofsuch undertakings are  uncertainand can have a negative short or long-term impact on the Companys operations and financialresults"

RISK FACTORS.The Company operates in over 40 countries around the world and faces a variety of risks anduncertainties that could materially affect its future operations and financial performance. Many ofthese risks and uncertainties are not within the Companys control. Risks that may significantlyimpact the Company include the following:Overall Economic Conditions and Demand for Products  General economic conditions in markets inwhich the Company does business can impact the demand for its goods and services. Decreased demandfor its products and services can have a negative impact on the Companys financial performance andcash flow.Demand for the Companys products and services in part depends on the general economic conditionsaffecting the countries and industries in which the Company does business. A downturn in economicconditions in a country or industry served by the Company may negatively impact demand for theCompanys products and services, in turn negatively impacting the Companys operations andfinancial results. Further, changes in demand for its products and services can magnify the impactof economic cycles on the Companys businesses. Unanticipated contract terminations by currentcustomers can negatively impact operations, financial results and cash flow. The Companys recentdivestiture of certain of its chemicals businesses, along with the potential sale of its polymersbusiness, should make the Company less susceptible to the cyclical nature of the chemicalsindustry.Competition  The Company faces strong competition from several large, global competitors and manysmaller regional ones in most of its business segments. Inability to compete effectively in asegment could adversely impact sales and financial performance.The Merchant Gases segment competes with three global industrial gas companies, LAir Liquide S.A.,Linde AG and Praxair, Inc., as well as with several regional competitors in North America(including Airgas, Inc.) and in Europe and Asia. Competition is based primarily on price, productquality, reliability of supply and development of innovative applications.The Tonnage Gases segment also competes with the three global industrial gas competitors notedabove as well as with several regional competitors in North America, Europe and Asia. Competitionis based primarily on price, product quality, reliability of supply, development of innovativeapplications and, in some instances, provision of additional items such as power and steamgeneration.The Electronics and Performance Materials segment faces competition on a product-by-product basisagainst companies ranging from niche suppliers with a single product to larger and more verticallyintegrated companies. Competition is principally conducted on the basis of price, quality, productperformance, reliability of product supply and technical service assistance.Equipment and Energy competes against many firms based primarily on technological performance,service, technical know-how, price and performance guarantees.Healthcare competes against many local and regional providers in the United States, including ApriaHealthcare Group and Lincare Holdings Inc., and against three large industrial gas companies, LAirLiquide, S.A., Linde AG and Praxair, Inc., as well as local and regional suppliers in Europe.Competition is based primarily on quality of service. Remaining competitive requires efficientlogistic, reimbursement and accounts receivable systems.The Chemicals segment competes against a large number of chemical companies, generally on aproduct-by-product basis, principally on the basis of price, quality, product performance,reliability of product supply and technical service assistance. Several of these competitors arelarger than the Company and are more vertically integrated.Raw Material and Energy Cost and Availability  Volatility in raw material and energy costs,interruption in ordinary sources of supply and an inability to recover unanticipated increases inenergy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or significantly increasethe cost of doing business.8Table of ContentsElectricity is the largest cost input for the production of atmospheric gases in Merchant Gases andTonnage Gases. Because the Companys industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts ofelectricity, energy price fluctuations could materially impact the financial performance of thesesegments. While the Company has been successful in contracting for electricity under multi-yearagreements and passing through the cost to its customers, there is no assurance that it will beable to do so in the future.Hydrocarbons, including natural gas, are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen,carbon monoxide and synthesis gas within Merchant Gases and Tonnage Gases. Volatility inhydrocarbon prices can impact the Companys financial performance. While the Company generallypasses this risk through to its customers under its take-or-pay contracts by matching feedstockprices to the purchase price of the product being produced, an inability to do so in the futurecould impact its financial results.The Companys large delivery truck fleet requires a readily available supply of gasoline and dieselfuel. The Company attempts to pass through increases in the cost of these fuels to its customerswhenever possible.Steel, aluminum and capital equipment subcomponents (such as compressors) are the principal rawmaterials in the equipment portion of the Equipment and Energy segment. Firm purchase agreementsthat cover the term of the project provide for adequate raw materials. Coal, petroleum coke andnatural gas are the largest cost components for the energy portion of this segment. These costs aremitigated, in part, through long-term cost-pass-through contracts.The Electronics and Performance Materials segment uses a wide variety of raw materials, includingalcohols, ethyleneamines, cyclohexamine, acrylonitriles and glycols. The Company purchases thesematerials from numerous suppliers. Though the Company attempts to pass through increases in thecost of these materials to its customers whenever possible, it is subject to competitive pressures.The principal raw materials used in Chemicals are chemical intermediates such as olefins andaromatic hydrocarbons produced by outside suppliers from basic petrochemical feed-stocks like crudeoil or natural gas. This segment also depends on adequate energy sources and natural gas as afeedstock for certain products. The Company does not depend on any one supplier for its chemicalintermediates supply.Despite the Companys contractual pass-through of the costs of energy, raw materials and deliveryfuel, a shortage or interruption in their supply or an increase in any of their prices that cannotbe passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons can negatively impact the Companysoperations, financial results and cash flow.Regulatory and Political Risks and Foreign Operations  The Company is subject to extensivegovernment regulation in jurisdictions around the globe in which it does business. Regulationsaddress, among other things, environmental compliance, import/export restrictions, healthcareservices, taxes and financial reporting, and can significantly increase the cost of doing business,which in turn can negatively impact the Companys operations, financial results and cash flow.The Company is subject to government regulation and intervention both in the United States and inall foreign jurisdictions in which it conducts its business. Compliance with applicable laws andregulations results in higher capital expenditures and operating costs and changes to currentregulations with which the Company complies can necessitate further capital expenditures andincreases in operating costs to enable continued compliance. Additionally, from time to time, theCompany is involved in proceedings under certain of these laws and regulations. Foreign operationsare subject to political instabilities, restrictions on funds transfers, import/export restrictionsand currency fluctuation. Significant areas of regulation and intervention include the following:Environmental and Health Compliance. The Company is committed to conducting its activities sothat there is no or only minimal damage to the environment; there is no assurance, however, thatits activities will not at times result in liability under environmental and health regulations.Costs and expenses resulting from such liability may materially negatively impact the Companysoperations and financial condition. Overall, environmental and health laws andregulations will continue to affect the Companys businesses worldwide. For a more detaileddescription of these matters, see Narrative Description of the Companys Business Generally Environmental Controls herein.9Table of ContentsImport/Export Regulation. The Company is subject to significant regulatory oversight of itsimport and export operations due to the nature of its product offerings. The Company voluntarilyparticipates in various government programs designed to enhance supply chain security andpromote appropriate screening practices and internal controls regarding its purchases and salesto customers around the world. Penalties for non-compliance can be significant and violation canresult in adverse publicity for the Company.Nationalization and Expropriation. The Companys operations in certain foreign jurisdictionsare subject to nationalization and expropriation risk and some of its contractual relationshipswithin these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss. Theoccurrence of any of these risks could have a material, adverse impact on the Companysoperations and financial condition. For a more detailed description of these matters, seeNarrative Description of the Companys Business Generally  Foreign Operations herein.Home Healthcare Regulation. The Companys Healthcare segment is subject to extensive governmentregulation, including laws directed at preventing fraud, abuse, kickbacks and false claims, lawsregulating billing and reimbursement under various governmental healthcare programs and lawsrelated to the privacy of patient data. Enforcement actions may be brought by the government orby qui tam relaters (private citizens bringing an action on behalf of the government), whichcould result in the imposition of fines or exclusion from participation in government healthcareprograms. Also, the government contracts with regional carriers who administer claims processingfor governmental healthcare programs. These carriers conduct both pre-payment and post-paymentreviews and audits, which could result in demands for refunds or recoupments of amounts paid.The Company maintains a compliance program designed to minimize the likelihood that it wouldengage in conduct that violates these requirements or that could result in material refunds orrecoupments. In addition, state and federal healthcare programs are subject to reform bylegislative and administrative initiatives that could impact the relative cost of doing businessand the amount of reimbursement for products and services provided by the Company. The Companyclosely monitors reform initiatives and participates actively in trade association and otheractivities designed to influence these reforms.Taxes. The Company structures its operations to be tax efficient and to make use of tax creditsand other incentives when it makes business sense to do so. Nevertheless, changes in tax laws,actual results of operations, final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities, and the timingand rate at which tax credits can be utilized can change the rate at which the Company is taxed,thereby affecting its financial results and cash flow.Financial Accounting Standards. The Companys financial results can be impacted by new ormodified financial accounting standards.Financial Market Risks  The Companys earnings, cash flow and financial position are exposed tofinancial market risks worldwide, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuationsand exchange rate controls.The Company operates in over 40 countries. It finances a portion of its operations through UnitedStates and foreign debt markets with various short-term and long-term public and privateborrowings, and conducts its business in both U.S. dollars and many foreign currencies.Consequently, it is subject to both interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations. TheCompany actively manages the interest rate risk inherent in its debt portfolio in accordance withparameters set by management addressing the type of debt issued (fixed versus floating rate) andthe use of derivative financial instruments. The Company strives to mitigate its currency exchangerate risks by minimizing cash flow exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates through theissuance of debt in currencies in which operating cash flows are generated and the use ofderivative financials instruments. Derivative counterparty risk is mitigated by contracting withmajor financial institutions that have investment grade credit ratings. All derivative instrumentsare entered into for other than trading purposes. For a more detailed analysis of these matters seeNote 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 herein.Catastrophic Events  Catastrophic events such as natural disasters, pandemics, war and acts ofterrorism, could disrupt the Companys business or the business of its suppliers or customers, anyof which disruptions could have a negative impact on the Companys operations, financial resultsand cash flow.The Companys operations are at all times subject to the occurrence of catastrophic events outsidethe Companys control, ranging from severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, floods,earthquakes and storms, to health epidemics and pandemics, to acts of war and terrorism. Any suchevent could cause a serious business disruption that could affect the Companys ability to produceand distribute its products and possibly expose it to third-party liability claims. Additionally,10Table of Contentssuch events could impact the Companys suppliers, in which event energy and raw materials may beunavailable to the Company, and its customers, who may be unable to purchase or accept theCompanys products and services. Any such occurrence could have a negative impact on the Companysoperations and financial condition.Company Undertakings  The Company actively manages its business to protect and optimize itsassets and businesses. There is no assurance, however, that the Companys undertakings will resultin the intended protections and optimizations. In certain circumstances, the Companys undertakingscould negatively impact its operations and financial results.Operations. Inherent in the Companys operations of its facilities, pipelines and deliverysystems are hazards that require continuous oversight and control. If operational risksmaterialize, they could result in loss of life, damage to the environment or loss of production,all of which could negatively impact the Companys on-going operations, financial results andcash flow. While the safety and security of the Companys operations have always been apriority, the Company has significantly expanded its efforts in this area since the terroristattacks of September 11, 2001. It has been an active participant in the development andimplementation of the American Chemistry Councils Responsible Care Security Code and hasimplemented this Code at all global facilities. Security vulnerability assessments (SVA) wereconducted and necessary security upgrades implemented at facilities in North American, Europeand Asia. There is one remaining project in Asia which will be completed by December 2007 andsecurity upgrades in Brazil are scheduled for completion by the end of fiscal year 2008. TheCompany has also developed global security standards to address the safety and security of itsglobal supply chain.Portfolio Management. The Company continuously reviews and manages its portfolio of assets inan attempt to conduct its businesses in a manner to maximize value to its shareholders.Portfolio management involves many variables, including future acquisitions and divestitures,restructurings and re-segmentations and cost-cutting and productivity initiatives. The timing,impact and ability to complete such undertakings, the costs and financial charges associatedwith such activities and the ultimate financial impact of such undertakings is uncertain and canhave a negative short or long-term impact on the Companys operations and financial results.Insurance. The Company carries public liability and property insurance in amounts thatmanagement believes are sufficient to meet its anticipated needs in light of historicalexperience to cover future litigation and property damage claims. Nevertheless, the occurrenceof an unforeseen event for which the Company does not have adequate insurance could result in anegative impact on its financial results and cash flow. There is no assurance that the Companywill collect insurance proceeds to which it is entitled if an insurers business fails or itrefuses to pay in a timely manner. Further, there is no assurance that the Company will notincur losses beyond the limits of, or outside the coverage of, its insurance policies.Security. Acts of terrorism that threaten the Company or its facilities, pipelines,transportation or computer systems could severely disrupt its business operations and adverselyaffect the results of operations.IT Risk. The security of the Companys IT systems could be compromised, which could adverselyaffect its ability to operate. The Company utilizes a global enterprise resource planning (ERP)system and other technologies for the distribution of information both within the Company and tocustomers and suppliers. The ERP system and other technologies are potentially vulnerable tointerruption from viruses, hackers or system breakdown. To mitigate these risks, the Company hasimplemented a variety of security measures, including virus protection, a state of the art datacenter, redundancy procedures and recovery processes. A significant system interruption,however, could seriously affect the Companys business operation and financial condition.Litigation. The Company is involved from time to time in various legal proceedings, includingcompetition, environmental, health, safety, product liability and insurance matters. There is arisk that a lawsuit may be settled or adjudicated for an amount that is not insured. Any suchuninsured amount could have a significant impact on the Companys financial condition and cashflow.Recruiting and Retaining. Continued business success depends on the recruitment, developmentand retention of qualified employees. The inability to attract, develop or retain qualityemployees could negatively impact the Companys business objectives which might adversely affectthe Companys business operation and financial condition.11Table of Contents"
