0,GT,GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER CO,2024-02-13,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when considering an investment decision with respect to our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If they do, our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be materially adversely affected. In such an instance, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment.Risks Related to Strategic Initiatives and OperationsIf we do not successfully implement the Goodyear Forward plan and our other strategic initiatives, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.On November 15, 2023, we announced a transformation plan, known as “Goodyear Forward,” that is intended to optimize our portfolio, deliver significant margin expansion and reduce leverage in order to drive sustainable and substantial shareholder value creation. We believe that the Goodyear Forward plan has ambitious, but achievable, goals. However, the successful implementation of the Goodyear Forward plan may face material challenges, including the ability of management and our employees to focus on implementing the Goodyear Forward plan as well as attending to our ongoing business; retaining key management and other employees; the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying the specific initiatives and goals included within the Goodyear Forward plan and the associated costs of implementing the plan; as well as potential unknown or unforeseen challenges, expenses or delays in implementing the Goodyear Forward plan. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement the cost reduction or top line actions in the Goodyear Forward plan or to realize or sustain the anticipated run-rate benefits within the time frames set out in the Goodyear Forward plan or at all.In addition, our ability to successfully market and sell our chemical business, the Dunlop brand and our OTR tire business is subject to prevailing general and industry-specific economic conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to sell these assets or operations within the time frames set out in the Goodyear Forward plan or at all or, even if we were able to take such actions, that we could do so at prices and on terms that are acceptable to us.If we are unable to successfully implement the actions set forth in the Goodyear Forward plan or other strategic initiatives, we may not be able to improve our operating results, including our operating margin, generate additional cash flow, or reduce our debt levels and leverage.We believe that our manufacturing footprint is less cost-competitive than that of our principal competitors. To begin to address this competitive disadvantage, we are closing several high-cost manufacturing facilities and curtailing production of tires for declining, less profitable segments of the tire market. We are also undertaking significant capital investments in building, expanding and modernizing certain manufacturing facilities around the world to strengthen the competitiveness of our manufacturing footprint and increase production of premium, large-rim diameter consumer tires. In addition, plant closures, construction and modernization may temporarily disrupt our manufacturing operations and lead to temporary increases in our costs. The failure to implement successfully this or our other important strategic initiatives may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We are pursuing other important strategic initiatives, such as our innovation excellence, sales and marketing excellence and operational excellence initiatives. Our innovation excellence initiatives are designed to create leading technologies, products and services that anticipate the mobility and sustainability needs of consumers and fleets. Our sales and marketing excellence initiatives are intended to capture the value of our brands and grow our market share, helping our customers win in their markets and ensuring we are the preferred choice of consumers. Our operational excellence initiatives are aimed at improving our safety, quality and efficiency and creating an advantaged supply chain that delivers the right tire, to the right place, at the right time, at the right cost. If we fail to execute these initiatives successfully or if the assumptions used in developing the initiatives vary significantly from actual conditions, we may fail to achieve our financial goals.Our performance is also dependent on our ability to improve the volume and mix of higher margin tires we sell in our targeted market segments. In order to do so, we must be successful in developing, producing, marketing and selling products that consumers desire and that offer higher margins to us. Shifts in consumer demand away from higher margin tires could materially adversely affect our business. We have been capacity constrained from time to time with respect to the production of certain higher margin tires, particularly in the United States. When faced with these constraints, we try to alleviate them by utilizing our global manufacturing footprint to meet the demand for our tires and by adding manufacturing capacity. However, 11Table of Contents in spite of these initiatives, we may not be able to meet all of the demand for certain of our higher margin tires, which could harm our competitive position and limit our growth. We cannot assure you that our strategic initiatives will be successful. If not, we may not be able to achieve or sustain future profitability, which would impair our ability to meet our debt and other obligations and would otherwise negatively affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We face significant global competition and our market share could decline.New tires are sold under highly competitive conditions throughout the world. We compete with other tire manufacturers on the basis of product design, performance, price and terms, reputation, warranty terms, customer service and consumer convenience. On a worldwide basis, we have two major competitors, Bridgestone (based in Japan) and Michelin (based in France), that have large shares of the markets of the countries in which they are based and are aggressively seeking to maintain or improve their worldwide market share. Other significant competitors include Continental, Hankook, Kumho, Nexen, Pirelli, Sumitomo, Toyo, Yokohama and various regional tire manufacturers. Our competitors produce significant numbers of tires in low-cost countries, and have announced plans to further increase their production capacity in countries around the globe. Increasingly, our competitors are making decisions on where to produce tires based not only on production cost, but in combination with total delivery cost, supply chain reliability and sustainability considerations. These increases in production capacity may result in even greater competition in the United States and elsewhere.Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in significant part, on our ability to continue to innovate and manufacture the types of tires demanded by consumers, and to reduce costs by such means as reducing excess and high-cost capacity, leveraging global purchasing, improving productivity, eliminating redundancies and increasing production at low-cost supply sources. If we are unable to compete successfully, our market share may decline, materially adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the automotive industry may experience significant changes due to the introduction of new technologies, such as electric and autonomous vehicles, or new services, business models or methods of travel, such as ride sharing. As the automotive industry evolves, we may need to provide a wider range of products and services to remain competitive, including products that we do not currently have the capability to manufacture or services that we do not currently offer. The demand for our products may also decline if automotive production declines and/or total vehicle miles traveled declines, including as a result of increasing fuel costs. If we do not accurately predict, prepare for and respond to market developments, technological innovations and changing customer and consumer needs and preferences, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost-effective manner.Our capital expenditures are limited by our liquidity and capital resources and by the need to pay our other expenses and to maintain adequate cash reserves and borrowing capacity to meet unexpected demands that may arise. We believe that our ratio of capital expenditures to sales is lower than the comparable ratio for our principal competitors.Productivity improvements and manufacturing cost improvements may be required to offset potential increases in labor and raw material costs, including inflationary increases, and competitive price pressures. In addition, as part of our strategy to reduce high-cost and excess manufacturing capacity and to increase our capacity to produce higher margin tires, we may need to modernize or expand our facilities. We may also need to make additional capital expenditures in order to achieve our global climate ambition and related goals. We are currently undertaking significant construction, expansion and modernization projects globally.We may not have sufficient resources to implement planned capital expenditures with minimal disruption to our existing manufacturing operations, or within desired time frames and budgets. Any disruption to our operations, delay in implementing capital improvements or unexpected costs may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.If we are unable to make sufficient capital expenditures, or to maximize the efficiency of the capital expenditures we do make, we may be unable to achieve productivity improvements, which may harm our competitive position, to manufacture the products necessary to compete successfully in our targeted market segments, or to achieve our global climate ambition and related goals. In addition, plant construction and modernization may temporarily disrupt our manufacturing operations and lead to temporary increases in our costs.12Table of Contents A prolonged economic downturn or economic uncertainty could adversely affect our business and results of operations.Deterioration of global or regional economic conditions, including recession, financial instability, inflation, labor shortages or energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges), could negatively impact our business and our results of operations. A prolonged economic downturn can adversely affect OE production levels and consumer spending habits on replacement tires, resulting in lower-than-expected net sales. Inflation, which has risen significantly, has and may continue to increase our operational costs, including labor, transportation and energy costs, and continued increases in interest rates in response to concerns about inflation may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty or creating recessionary economic conditions. As a result, instability and weakness of the U.S. and global economies, including due to recession, inflation, high unemployment, disruptions to financial markets, geopolitical events and public health crises, and the corresponding negative effects on consumer spending, may materially negatively affect our business and results of operations, including impairment charges relating to goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other long-lived assets.Raw material, energy and transportation costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Raw material, energy and transportation costs can be volatile. Inflationary cost pressures, among other factors, may cause increases in the prices of natural and synthetic rubber, carbon black and petrochemical-based commodities. Market conditions, including actions by competitors, or contractual obligations may prevent us from passing any such increased costs on to our customers through timely price increases. Additionally, increased demand for consumer products and supply chain disruptions as a result of global events, including disruptions to transportation routes, port congestion and container shortages, has led to inflationary cost pressures on transportation. Higher raw material, energy and transportation costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. High demand for and/or limited availability of raw materials and other energy sources could result in declining margins and operating results and adversely affect our financial condition. The volatility of raw material costs may cause our margins, operating results and liquidity to fluctuate. In addition, lower raw material costs may put downward pressure on the price of tires, which could ultimately reduce our margins and adversely affect our results of operations. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate sources of raw materials, energy or transportation, its operations could be interrupted. In addition, fluctuations in the price of gasoline for consumers can affect driving and purchasing habits and impact demand for tires.If we fail to extend or renegotiate significant collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions as they expire from time to time, or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.We are a party to collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions, which represent a significant number of our employees, including our collective bargaining agreements with the USW. Our primary collective bargaining agreement with the USW, which covers approximately 5,300 of our associates in the United States at December 31, 2023, expires in July 2026. Approximately 2,200 of our associates at our Texarkana and Findlay plants in the United States at December 31, 2023 are covered by separate collective bargaining agreements with the USW, which expire in June 2024. In addition, approximately 20,000 of our associates outside of the United States are covered by union contracts that have expired or are expiring in 2024, primarily in Luxembourg, Poland, Brazil, Mexico, China, Slovenia, Turkey, India and Serbia. Although we believe that our relations with our associates are satisfactory, no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time to time. If we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements, if disputes with our unions arise, or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, we could experience a significant disruption of, or inefficiencies in, our operations or incur higher labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We have manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the world. Our international operations are subject to certain inherent risks, including:•exposure to local economic conditions;•adverse foreign currency fluctuations;•adverse currency exchange controls;•withholding taxes and restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings; •tax policies and regulations;13Table of Contents •labor regulations;•tariffs;•government price and profit margin controls;•expropriations of property;•adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States;•the potential instability of foreign governments;•hostility from local populations and insurrections or armed conflicts;•risks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities;•export and import restrictions; and•other changes in laws or government policies.The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable. Certain regions, including Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, are inherently more economically and politically volatile and, as a result, our business units that operate in these regions could be subject to significant fluctuations in sales and operating income from quarter to quarter. Because a significant percentage of our operating income in recent years has come from these regions, adverse fluctuations in the operating results in these regions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in future periods.In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export laws, anti-competition laws, anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, data privacy laws such as the GDPR, labor laws, tax laws, and accounting, internal control and disclosure requirements. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations. In certain foreign jurisdictions, there is a higher risk of fraud or corruption and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls and compliance programs. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws and regulations.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting government sanctions could result in significant macroeconomic consequences, including increased inflationary pressures, market volatility, economic restrictions and business disruptions, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.We suspended all shipments of tires to Russia during the first quarter of 2022 and discontinued our Russian operations in January 2023. The war between Russia and Ukraine has not had and is not expected to have a direct material impact on our financial results. Nonetheless, the ongoing conflict has aggravated already challenging macroeconomic trends, including global supply chain disruptions, higher costs for certain raw materials and higher energy and transportation costs. The conflict has led to increases in the cost of energy and the potential for energy shortages, especially in Europe. We have taken steps to offset the increased cost, but we cannot predict the degree to or the time period over which energy costs will increase.In response to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine, a number of countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and members of the European Union, have implemented economic sanctions on Russia and certain Russian enterprises and individuals. The conflict could result in further sanctions and embargoes, regional instability and potential retaliatory action by the Russian government, including cyber-attacks. While we continue to take actions to ensure the safety of our associates and the continuity of our business operations, the extent of the conflict’s impact on the global economy cannot be predicted, particularly if the conflict were to intensify or expand.Financial difficulties, work stoppages, supply disruptions or economic conditions affecting our major customers, dealers or suppliers could harm our business.Automotive vehicle production and global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict. Although sales to our OE customers accounted for approximately 17% of our net sales in 2023, demand for our products by OE customers and production levels at our facilities are impacted by automotive vehicle production. Automotive production and sales are highly cyclical and 14Table of Contents sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors, such as credit availability, interest rates, fuel prices, and consumer preference and confidence. Economic declines that result in a significant reduction in automotive production would have an adverse effect on our sales to OE customers. We may experience future declines in sales volume due to declines in new vehicle production and sales, the performance, discontinuation or sale of certain OE brands, platforms or programs, increased competition, or weakness in the demand for replacement tires, which could result in us incurring under-absorbed fixed costs at our production facilities or slowing the rate at which we are able to recover those costs. At various times, some regions around the world may be more particularly impacted by these factors than other regions.Automotive production can also be affected by labor relation issues or shortages, financial difficulties or supply disruptions. Our OE customers could experience production disruptions resulting from their own or supplier labor, financial or supply difficulties. Such events may cause an OE customer to reduce or suspend vehicle production. Other customers, such as dealers, retailers or distributors, may experience similar disruptions to their operations. As a result, a customer could halt or significantly reduce purchases of our products, which would harm our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We cannot predict when customers will decide to increase or decrease inventory levels or whether new inventory levels will approximate historical inventory levels. Uncertainty and other unexpected fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.Our suppliers could also experience production disruptions due to labor, financial, supply or transportation difficulties, or new environmental laws or stricter enforcement of existing environmental laws. Any such production disruptions may result in the unexpected closure of our suppliers' facilities or increases in the cost of our raw materials, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the bankruptcy, restructuring or consolidation of one or more of our major customers, dealers or suppliers could result in the write-off of accounts receivable, a reduction in purchases of our products or a supply disruption to our facilities, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially adversely affected.Our business substantially depends on the continued service of key members of our management. The loss of the services of a significant number of members of our management could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, such as engineering, marketing and senior management professionals. Competition for these employees is intense, and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. Our ability to attract and retain employees may also be hampered by downturns in the automotive and tire industries, which could result in reduced payments under our incentive compensation plans, as well as by greater competition due to the increase in use of remote working environments. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting new high quality employees, our business could be materially adversely affected.Increasing competition for highly skilled and talented workers, as well as labor shortages, could adversely affect our business.A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us or increase labor costs, including high employment levels and government regulations. Although we have not experienced any material labor shortages to date, we have observed an increasingly competitive labor market. The increasing competition for highly skilled and talented employees has resulted, and could in the future result, in higher compensation costs and could result in difficulties in maintaining a capable workforce. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high-level, or if mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability, such as overtime and third-party outsourcing, have unintended negative effects, our business could be adversely affected. A sustained labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor cost inflation as a result of general macroeconomic factors could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, which could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing and distribution facilities and overall business and have other adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition. We have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales.We operate with significant operating and financial leverage. Significant portions of our manufacturing, selling, administrative and general expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with sales. In addition, a significant portion of our interest expense is fixed. There can be no assurance that we would be able to reduce our fixed costs proportionately in response to a decline in our net sales and therefore our competitiveness could be significantly impacted. As a result, a decline in our net sales could result in a higher percentage decline in our income from operations and net income.15Table of Contents Environmental issues, including climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address environmental issues, may negatively affect our business and operations and cause us to incur significant costs.Our manufacturing and distribution facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect the environment, including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change, and we expect that additional requirements with respect to environmental matters, including reporting requirements, will be imposed on us in the future. In addition, we have contractual indemnification obligations for environmental remediation costs and liabilities that may arise relating to certain divested operations. There is also growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that issues related to such climate change have a negative effect on our business, we may be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain raw materials, including natural rubber. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may also disrupt the productivity of our facilities, our supply chain or the operations of our customers. If the frequency or severity of extreme weather and natural disasters increases over time, we may experience a greater number of losses at certain of our facilities. Such losses could lead to an increase in the deductibles or cost of insurance for those facilities, a reduction of insurance available to us, or the unavailability of insurance on terms that are acceptable to us.Our manufacturing facilities may become subject to further limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases due to public policy concerns regarding climate change issues or other environmental or health and safety concerns. While the form of any additional regulations cannot be predicted, a “cap-and-trade” system similar to the one adopted in the European Union could be adopted in the United States. Any such “cap-and-trade” system (including the system currently in place in the European Union) or other limitations imposed on the emission of greenhouse gases could require us to increase our capital expenditures, use our cash to acquire emission credits or restructure our manufacturing operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.Material future expenditures may be necessary if compliance standards change, if material unknown conditions that require remediation are discovered, or if required remediation of known conditions becomes more extensive than expected. If we fail to comply with present and future environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production, which could harm our business or results of operations. Environmental laws could also restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses in connection with our manufacturing processes.Risks Related to Our Capital StructureOur long-term ability to meet our obligations, to repay maturing indebtedness or to implement strategic initiatives may be dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results.The adequacy of our liquidity depends on our ability to achieve an appropriate combination of operating improvements, financing from third parties and access to capital markets. We may need to undertake additional financing actions in the capital markets in order to ensure that our future liquidity requirements are addressed or to implement strategic initiatives. These actions may include the issuance of additional debt or equity, or the factoring of our accounts receivable.Our access to the capital markets cannot be assured and is dependent on, among other things, the ability and willingness of financial institutions to extend credit on terms that are acceptable to us or our suppliers, or to honor future draws on our existing lines of credit, and the degree of success we have in implementing our strategic initiatives. We have continued our use of supplier financing programs and the factoring of our accounts receivable in order to improve our working capital efficiency and reduce our costs. If these programs become unavailable or less attractive to us or our suppliers, our liquidity could be adversely affected.Future liquidity requirements, or our inability to access cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit, also may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. A substantial portion of our assets is subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness.Our inability to access the capital markets or incur additional debt in the future could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations, and could require us to consider further measures, including deferring planned capital expenditures, reducing discretionary spending, selling additional assets and restructuring existing debt.16Table of Contents We have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health.We have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 31, 2023, our debt (including finance leases) on a consolidated basis was approximately $7.6 billion. Our substantial amount of debt and other obligations could have important consequences. For example, it could:•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;•impair our ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, acquisitions or general corporate requirements;•increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;•limit our ability to use cash flows from operating activities in other areas of our business or to return cash to shareholders because we would need to dedicate a substantial portion of these funds for payments on our indebtedness;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.The agreements governing our debt, including our credit agreements, limit, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional debt and we may incur a significant amount of additional debt in the future, including additional secured debt. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, our ability to satisfy our debt obligations may become more limited.Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt and other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to our ability to implement our strategic initiatives, prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay expansion plans and capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that our operating performance, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient to pay our debt obligations when they become due. We cannot assure you that we would be able to dispose of material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt or other obligations if necessary or, even if we were able to take such actions, that we could do so on terms that are acceptable to us.Any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our debt instruments, or a material reduction in the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations.The agreements governing our secured credit facilities, senior unsecured notes and our other outstanding indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business or implement strategic initiatives, such as the Goodyear Forward plan, and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things:•incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock;•pay dividends, repurchase shares or make certain other restricted payments or investments;•incur liens;•sell assets;•incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us;•enter into affiliate transactions;•engage in sale/leaseback transactions; and•engage in certain mergers or consolidations or transfers of substantially all of our assets.Certain of the strategic alternatives that we may pursue for our chemical business, the Dunlop brand or our OTR tire business may, depending on the terms of any particular transaction, require a waiver or an amendment of our credit facilities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain waivers from our lenders or amend the relevant covenants in our credit facilities.Availability under our first lien revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory, the value of our principal trademarks, the value of eligible machinery and equipment, and certain cash in an amount not to exceed $275 million. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and inventory and other components of the borrowing base decline in value, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under that facility 17Table of Contents may decrease below its stated amount. In addition, if at any time the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under that facility exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to prepay borrowings and/or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess.Our ability to comply with these covenants or to maintain our borrowing base may be affected by events beyond our control, including deteriorating economic conditions, and these events could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures. We cannot assure you that such waivers, amendments or alternative financing could be obtained, or if obtained, would be on terms acceptable to us.A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in any of our existing or future financing agreements, including the financial covenants in our secured credit facilities, could result in an event of default under those agreements. Such a default could allow the lenders under our financing agreements, if the agreements so provide, to discontinue lending, to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, and/or to declare all borrowings outstanding thereunder to be due and payable. In addition, the lenders could terminate any commitments they have to provide us with further funds. If any of these events occur, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available to pay in full the total amount of obligations that become due as a result of any such acceleration, or that we will be able to find additional or alternative financing to refinance any such accelerated obligations. Even if we obtain additional or alternative financing, we cannot assure you that it would be on terms that would be acceptable to us.We cannot assure you that we will be able to remain in compliance with the covenants to which we are subject in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from our lenders or amend the covenants.Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.Certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, which would require us to use more of our available cash to service our indebtedness. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to enter into swap agreements or other hedging arrangements in the future if we desire to do so, or that any existing or future hedging arrangements will offset increases in interest rates. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $1.5 billion of variable rate debt outstanding.Risks Related to Information Technology and Intellectual PropertyWe may be adversely affected by any disruption in, or failure of, our information technology systems.We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology (""IT"") systems across all of our major business functions, including our research and development, manufacturing, retail, financial and administrative functions. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing upgrades when necessary. Our security measures are focused on the prevention, detection and remediation of damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, cyber-attack, natural disasters and other similar disruptions. We may incur significant costs in order to implement the security measures that we feel are necessary to protect our IT systems. However, our IT systems may remain vulnerable to damage despite our implementation of security measures that we deem to be appropriate. In addition, we are also dependent on third parties to provide important IT services relating to, among other things, human resources, electronic communications and certain finance functions.We collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of our customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and associates, in data centers and on IT networks. Additionally, we are subject to privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations (“Data Protection Laws”) in the United States and in jurisdictions around the globe that restrict the use, disclosure, transfer and processing of personal data. For example, we are subject to the GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), and the Brazilian Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados. Costs to comply with these Data Protection Laws are significant and the failure to comply with these laws could result in material legal exposure and business impact. The GDPR, for example, imposes onerous accountability obligations on companies, with penalties for non-compliance of up to the greater of €20 million or four percent of annual global revenue. The GDPR, and other Data Protection Laws, also grant corrective powers to supervisory authorities, including the ability to impose a limit on processing personal data or to order companies to cease operations. The Data Protection Laws are part of an evolving global data protection landscape in which the number, complexity, requirements and consequences of non-compliance with these laws are increasing. This landscape includes legislative proposals recently adopted or currently pending in the United States, at both the federal and state levels, as well as in other jurisdictions, 18Table of Contents implementing new or additional requirements for data protection that could further increase compliance costs, the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services, and significantly affect our business. Any system failure, accident or security breach involving our or our third party's IT systems could result in disruptions to our operations. A breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets, negatively impact our manufacturing or retail operations, or result in the compromise of personal information of our employees, customers or suppliers. While we have, from time to time, experienced system failures, accidents and security and privacy breaches involving our IT systems, these incidents have not had a material impact on our operations, and we are not aware of any resulting theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, material data or confidential information. To the extent that any system failure, accident or security or privacy breach results in material disruptions to our operations or the theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, material data or confidential information, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights adequately.Our success depends in part upon our ability to use and protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property, which generally covers various aspects of the design and manufacture of our products and processes. We own and use tradenames and trademarks worldwide. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. The steps we take in this regard may not be adequate to protect our intellectual property or to prevent or deter challenges or infringement or other violations of our intellectual property, and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights.In addition, the laws of some countries may not protect and enforce our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Further, while we believe we have rights to use all of the intellectual property we use, if we are found to infringe on the rights of others, we could be adversely impacted.Damage to our brand and reputation could have an adverse effect on our business.Our well-known and trusted brand names are a key competitive advantage. We believe that our future success depends, in part, on preserving, enhancing, and leveraging the value of our brands and executing our brand strategies, which are designed to drive end-user demand for our products. A decline in the reputation of one or more of our brands as a result of deficiencies or defects in the design or manufacture of our products, or from legal proceedings, product recalls or warranty claims resulting from such deficiencies or defects, may harm our reputation, reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business.Risks Related to Litigation, Laws and RegulationsWe could be negatively impacted by changes in tariffs, trade agreements or other trade restrictions on imported tires, raw materials and other goods or equipment. The imposition of new tariffs, changes in existing tariff rates, changes in or the repeal of trade agreements or other trade restrictions may reduce our flexibility to utilize our global manufacturing footprint to meet demand for our tires around the world. In addition, the imposition of tariffs in the United States may result in the tires subject to such tariffs being diverted to other regions of the world, such as Europe, Latin America or Asia, or in retaliatory tariffs or other actions by affected countries. Broad-based tariffs and other trade restrictions could also increase costs for our suppliers who may increase prices to us. Finally, tariffs and other trade restrictions may weaken the economies of key markets for us, such as China, resulting in lower economic growth rates and weakened demand for our products and services. These factors, individually or together, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We may incur significant costs in connection with our contingent liabilities and tax matters.We have significant reserves for contingent liabilities and tax matters. The major categories of our contingent liabilities include workers' compensation and other employment-related claims, product liability and other tort claims, including asbestos claims, and environmental matters. Our recorded liabilities and estimates of reasonably possible losses for our contingent liabilities are based on our assessment of potential liability using the information available to us at the time and, where applicable, any past experience and recent and current trends with respect to similar matters. Our contingent liabilities are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable judicial or administrative decisions could occur that we did not anticipate. Such an unfavorable decision could include monetary damages, fines or other penalties or an injunction prohibiting us from taking certain actions or selling certain products. If such an unfavorable decision were to occur, it could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations in the period in which the decision occurs, or in future periods.19Table of Contents The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations, including with respect to transfer pricing. While we apply consistent transfer pricing policies and practices globally, support transfer prices through economic studies, seek advance pricing agreements and joint audits to the extent possible and believe our transfer prices to be appropriate, such transfer prices, and related interpretations of tax laws, are occasionally challenged by various taxing authorities globally. We have received various tax assessments challenging our interpretations of applicable tax laws in various jurisdictions. Although we believe we have complied with applicable tax laws, have strong positions and defenses and have historically been successful in defending such claims, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in the case we are unsuccessful in the defense of existing or future claims. If we wish to appeal any future adverse judgment in any of these proceedings, we may be required to post an appeal bond with the relevant court. If we were subject to a significant adverse judgment or experienced an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity, we may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.We have significant deferred tax assets. We must generate sufficient earnings of the appropriate character in order to utilize our deferred tax assets. If our earnings remain flat or decline over an extended period of time, we may not be able to utilize our deferred tax assets and we may need to record a valuation allowance against them that could materially adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which the valuation allowance is recorded.For further information regarding our contingent liabilities and tax matters, refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 20, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, and No. 7, Income Taxes. For further information regarding our accounting policies with respect to certain of our contingent liabilities and uncertain income tax positions, refer to “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies.”We are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating results.We are subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation through NHTSA, which has established various standards and regulations applicable to tires sold in the United States and tires sold in a foreign country that are identical or substantially similar to tires sold in the United States. NHTSA has the authority to order the recall of automotive products, including tires, having safety-related defects or that do not comply with a motor vehicle safety standard, and, in some cases, to assess penalties.The TREAD Act imposes numerous requirements with respect to the early warning reporting of warranty claims, property damage claims, and bodily injury and fatality claims and also requires tire manufacturers, among other things, to comply with revised and more rigorous tire testing standards. Compliance with the TREAD Act regulations has increased the cost of producing and distributing tires in the United States. We have been subject to recalls in the past and it is possible that a recall of our tires, including under the TREAD Act or in other countries under similar regulations, could occur in the future. A substantial recall or related penalties could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and financial condition.In addition, pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, NHTSA may establish a national tire fuel efficiency consumer information program. If a related rule-making process is completed, certain tires sold in the United States would be required to be rated for rolling resistance, traction and tread wear. While the federal law preempts state tire fuel efficiency laws adopted after January 1, 2006, we may become subject to additional tire fuel efficiency legislation, either in the United States or other countries.Our European operations are subject to regulation by the European Union. Two regulations, the Tire Safety Regulation and the Tire Labeling Regulation, applicable to tires sold in the European Union have been adopted. The Tire Safety Regulation sets performance standards that tires for cars and light and commercial trucks need to meet for rolling resistance, wet grip braking (passenger car tires only) and noise in order to be sold in the European Union. The Tire Labeling Regulation applies to all passenger car, light truck and commercial truck tires and requires that consumers be informed about the tire's fuel efficiency, wet grip and noise characteristics. Other countries, such as Brazil, have also adopted tire labeling regulations, and additional countries may also introduce similar regulations in the future.Tires produced or sold in Europe also have to comply with various other standards, including environmental laws such as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemical Substances), which regulates the use of chemicals in the European Union. For example, REACH prohibits the use of highly aromatic oils in tires, which were used as compounding components to improve certain performance characteristics.These U.S. and European regulations, rules adopted to implement these regulations, or other similar regulations that may be adopted in the United States, Europe or elsewhere in the future may require us to alter or increase our capital spending and research and development plans or cease the production of certain tires, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.20Table of Contents Laws and regulations governing environmental and occupational safety and health are complicated, change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time. As a manufacturing company, we are subject to these laws and regulations both inside and outside the United States. We may not be in complete compliance with such laws and regulations at all times. Our costs or liabilities relating to them may be more than the amount we have reserved, and that difference may be material.Compliance with the laws and regulations described above or any of the myriad of applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations currently in effect or that may be adopted in the future could materially adversely affect our competitive position, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.General Risk Factors
We have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.The financial position and results of operations of many of our international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on our reported sales and operating margin (and conversely, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies has a positive impact). For the year ended December 31, 2023, foreign currency translation unfavorably affected sales by $169 million and unfavorably affected segment operating income by $23 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The volatility of currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results. For the year ended December 31, 2023, net foreign currency exchange losses were $87 million.We may be impacted by economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, including the current conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters.We manage businesses and facilities worldwide. Our facilities and operations, and the facilities and operations of our suppliers and customers, could be disrupted by events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes, or severe weather conditions or natural disasters. In addition, our operations could be adversely affected as a result of other disruptions at our facilities due to fire, electrical blackouts, power losses, telecommunications failures or other similar effects. Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales and customers. We may not be insured against all such potential losses and, if insured, the insurance proceeds that we receive may not adequately compensate us for all of our losses. Such losses could lead to an increase in the deductibles or cost of insurance for those facilities, a reduction of insurance available to us, or the unavailability of insurance on terms that are acceptable to us"
11,GT,GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER CO,2023-02-13,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when considering an investment decision with respect to our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If they do, our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be materially adversely affected. In such an instance, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment.Risks Related to the Cooper Tire AcquisitionWe may not achieve all of the intended benefits of the acquisition of Cooper Tire and our integration efforts may disrupt our current plans or operations.Although we are on track to achieve the expected synergies from the Cooper Tire acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete the integration of Cooper Tire’s operations and assets or otherwise realize the remaining expected benefits of the acquisition (including additional operating and other cost synergies). We expect to continue our efforts to integrate Cooper Tire during the first half of 2023. Difficulties in integrating Cooper Tire and Goodyear may result in Goodyear performing differently than expected, in operational challenges, in the failure to realize or sustain anticipated run-rate cost synergies and efficiencies in the expected timeframe or at all, or in the difficulty or failure of utilizing our available U.S. tax attributes, in which case the Cooper Tire acquisition may not be accretive to earnings per share, may not improve our balance sheet position, may not enhance our ability to delever, and may not generate additional free cash flow due to reduced cash tax payments. The continued integration of the two companies may result in material challenges, including the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns; retaining key management and other employees; retaining or attracting business and operational relationships; the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process and associated expenses; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; coordinating geographically separate organizations; unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; as well as potential unknown liabilities or unforeseen expenses or delays relating to integration.Risks Related to OperationsOur results of operations and financial condition have been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or similar public health crises, and that impact may be material.The COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and continues to cause, volatility in the global economy, the tire industry and our business. In response to the pandemic, international, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities took extraordinary actions to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 throughout most regions of the world, including travel bans, quarantines, “stay-at-home” orders and similar mandates that caused many individuals to substantially restrict their daily activities and many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations, and they may take additional or further actions in the future.The tire industry has been negatively impacted by this evolving situation. In 2020, there was a sudden and sharp decline in replacement tire demand and original equipment manufacturers suspended or severely limited automobile production globally. Recovery in automobile production globally has been constrained by supply chain disruptions, including an insufficient availability of semiconductor chips, caused by COVID-19 and a variety of global factors. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or similar public health crises, may result in decisions to change future production levels based on an evaluation of market demand signals, inventory and supply levels, as well as our ability to continue to safeguard the health of our associates. We have experienced, and may experience in the future, unexpected delays or obstacles, such as disruptions in our and our customers' supply chains or government mandates, that may hamper our ability to achieve planned production levels. Due to national and local efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 and its related variants in certain countries, such as China, renewed stay-at-home orders and other restrictions on mobility required us to temporarily shut down or limit production at some of our facilities, including our facilities in Pulandian and Kunshan, China, at various times throughout 2022. Any suspension of production at our manufacturing facilities, or difficulties or inefficiencies in resuming or increasing production, is likely to adversely impact our future results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and that impact may be material. In addition, our ability to continue implementing important strategic initiatives and capital expenditures may be reduced as we devote time and other resources to responding to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or similar public health crises.11Table of Contents Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating and financing activities. Our cash flows from operating activities are driven primarily by our operating results and changes in our working capital requirements and our cash flows from financing activities are dependent upon our ability to access credit or other capital. If the COVID-19 pandemic becomes more pronounced in markets where we operate, our liquidity position may deteriorate. While we actively monitor our liquidity and took a number of actions aimed at mitigating the negative consequences of the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our cash flows and liquidity, our cash flows may decline if global economic activity declines or we are unable to have sufficient access to credit or other capital. For example, the borrowing base under our first lien revolving credit facility is dependent, in significant part, on our eligible accounts receivable and inventory, which would decline if our sales and production levels declined. Additionally, our European revolving credit facility contains a leverage ratio covenant applicable to Goodyear Europe B.V. and its subsidiaries.  While we are currently in compliance with this covenant, if we were unable to satisfy this covenant in the future or obtain a waiver from our lenders, we would no longer be able to access our €800 million European revolving credit facility or our pan-European accounts receivable securitization facility.The situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic remains fluid.  The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity will depend on future developments, such as the ultimate duration and scope of the pandemic, resurgence in COVID-19 cases, travel restrictions, government mandated restrictions and regulations, business and workforce disruptions, the impact on demand for our products, the effectiveness of actions taken to contain and treat the disease, including the efficacy of and ability to widely distribute vaccinations and therapeutics, and whether the pandemic leads to recessionary conditions in any of our key markets. Accordingly, the ultimate impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity cannot be determined at this time. To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, it may also have the effect of significantly heightening many of the other risks associated with our business, operations and indebtedness.If we do not successfully implement our strategic initiatives, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.We are pursuing important strategic initiatives, such as our innovation excellence, sales and marketing excellence and operational excellence initiatives. Our innovation excellence initiatives are designed to create leading technologies, products and services that anticipate the mobility and sustainability needs of consumers and fleets. Our sales and marketing excellence initiatives are intended to capture the value of our brands and grow our market share, helping our customers win in their markets and ensuring we are the preferred choice of consumers. Our operational excellence initiatives are aimed at improving our safety, quality and efficiency and creating an advantaged supply chain that delivers the right tire, to the right place, at the right time, at the right cost. If we fail to execute these initiatives successfully or if the assumptions used in developing the initiatives vary significantly from actual conditions, we may fail to achieve our financial goals.We believe that our manufacturing footprint is less cost-competitive than that of our principal competitors. To begin to address this competitive disadvantage, we are curtailing production of tires for declining, less profitable segments of the tire market (including closure of our Melksham, United Kingdom tire manufacturing facility) and undertaking significant capital investments in building, expanding and modernizing certain manufacturing facilities around the world to strengthen the competitiveness of our manufacturing footprint and increase production of premium, large-rim diameter consumer tires. The failure to implement successfully this or our other important strategic initiatives may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.Our performance is also dependent on our ability to improve the volume and mix of higher margin tires we sell in our targeted market segments. In order to do so, we must be successful in developing, producing, marketing and selling products that consumers desire and that offer higher margins to us. Shifts in consumer demand away from higher margin tires could materially adversely affect our business. We have been capacity constrained from time to time with respect to the production of certain higher margin tires, particularly in the United States. When faced with these constraints, we try to alleviate them by utilizing our global manufacturing footprint to meet the demand for our tires and by adding manufacturing capacity. However, in spite of these initiatives, we may not be able to meet all of the demand for certain of our higher margin tires, which could harm our competitive position and limit our growth. We cannot assure you that our strategic initiatives will be successful. If not, we may not be able to achieve or sustain future profitability, which would impair our ability to meet our debt and other obligations and would otherwise negatively affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We face significant global competition and our market share could decline.New tires are sold under highly competitive conditions throughout the world. We compete with other tire manufacturers on the basis of product design, performance, price and terms, reputation, warranty terms, customer service and consumer convenience. On a worldwide basis, we have two major competitors, Bridgestone (based in Japan) and Michelin (based in France), that have 12Table of Contents large shares of the markets of the countries in which they are based and are aggressively seeking to maintain or improve their worldwide market share. Other significant competitors include Continental, Hankook, Kumho, Nexen, Pirelli, Sumitomo, Toyo, Yokohama and various regional tire manufacturers. Our competitors produce significant numbers of tires in low-cost countries, and have announced plans to further increase their production capacity in countries around the globe. Increasingly, our competitors are making decisions on where to produce tires based not only on production cost, but in combination with total delivery cost, supply chain reliability and sustainability considerations. These increases in production capacity may result in even greater competition in the United States and elsewhere.Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in significant part, on our ability to continue to innovate and manufacture the types of tires demanded by consumers, and to reduce costs by such means as reducing excess and high-cost capacity, leveraging global purchasing, improving productivity, eliminating redundancies and increasing production at low-cost supply sources. If we are unable to compete successfully, our market share may decline, materially adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the automotive industry may experience significant changes due to the introduction of new technologies, such as electric and autonomous vehicles, or new services, business models or methods of travel, such as ride sharing. As the automotive industry evolves, we may need to provide a wider range of products and services to remain competitive, including products that we do not currently have the capability to manufacture or services that we do not currently offer. The demand for our products may also decline if automotive production declines and/or total vehicle miles traveled declines, including as a result of increasing fuel costs. If we do not accurately predict, prepare for and respond to market developments, technological innovations and changing customer and consumer needs and preferences, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost-effective manner.Our capital expenditures are limited by our liquidity and capital resources and by the need to pay our other expenses and to maintain adequate cash reserves and borrowing capacity to meet unexpected demands that may arise. We believe that our ratio of capital expenditures to sales is lower than the comparable ratio for our principal competitors.Productivity improvements and manufacturing cost improvements may be required to offset potential increases in labor and raw material costs, including inflationary increases, and competitive price pressures. In addition, as part of our strategy to reduce high-cost and excess manufacturing capacity and to increase our capacity to produce higher margin tires, we may need to modernize or expand our facilities. We may also need to make additional capital expenditures in order to achieve our global climate ambition and related goals. We are currently undertaking significant construction, expansion and modernization projects globally.We may not have sufficient resources to implement planned capital expenditures with minimal disruption to our existing manufacturing operations, or within desired time frames and budgets. Any disruption to our operations, delay in implementing capital improvements or unexpected costs may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.If we are unable to make sufficient capital expenditures, or to maximize the efficiency of the capital expenditures we do make, we may be unable to achieve productivity improvements, which may harm our competitive position, to manufacture the products necessary to compete successfully in our targeted market segments, or to achieve our global climate ambition and related goals. In addition, plant construction and modernization may temporarily disrupt our manufacturing operations and lead to temporary increases in our costs.A prolonged economic downturn or economic uncertainty could adversely affect our business and results of operations.Deterioration of global or regional economic conditions, including recession, financial instability, inflation, labor shortages or energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges), could negatively impact our business and our results of operations. A prolonged economic downturn can adversely affect OE production levels and consumer spending habits on replacement tires, resulting in lower-than-expected net sales. Inflation, which has risen significantly, has and may continue to increase our operational costs, including labor, transportation and energy costs, and continued increases in interest rates in response to concerns about inflation may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty or creating recessionary economic conditions. As a result, instability and weakness of the U.S. and global economies, including due to recession, inflation, high unemployment, disruptions to financial markets, geopolitical events and other effects caused directly or indirectly by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the corresponding negative effects on consumer spending, may materially negatively affect our business and results of operations.13Table of Contents Raw material, energy and transportation costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Raw material, energy and transportation costs can be volatile. Inflationary cost pressures, among other factors, may cause increases in the prices of natural and synthetic rubber, carbon black and petrochemical-based commodities. Market conditions, including actions by competitors, or contractual obligations may prevent us from passing any such increased costs on to our customers through timely price increases. Additionally, increased demand for consumer products and supply chain disruptions as a result of the pandemic and other global events, including port congestion and container shortages, has led to inflationary cost pressures on transportation. Higher raw material, energy and transportation costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. High demand for and/or limited availability of raw materials and other energy sources could result in declining margins and operating results and adversely affect our financial condition. The volatility of raw material costs may cause our margins, operating results and liquidity to fluctuate. In addition, lower raw material costs may put downward pressure on the price of tires, which could ultimately reduce our margins and adversely affect our results of operations. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate sources of raw materials, energy or transportation, its operations could be interrupted. In addition, fluctuations in the price of gasoline for consumers can affect driving and purchasing habits and impact demand for tires.If we fail to extend or renegotiate significant collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions as they expire from time to time, or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.We are a party to collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions, which represent a significant number of our employees, including our collective bargaining agreements with the USW. The new Goodyear agreement with the USW, which covers approximately 5,700 of our associates in the United States at December 31, 2022, was ratified in the second half of 2022 and expires in July 2026.  Approximately 2,300 of our associates at our Texarkana and Findlay plants in the United States at December 31, 2022 are covered by separate collective bargaining agreements with the USW, which expire in June 2024 and February 2024, respectively. In addition, approximately 21,000 of our associates outside of the United States are covered by union contracts that have expired or are expiring in 2023, primarily in Germany, Poland, China, Mexico, Slovenia, France and Turkey. Although we believe that our relations with our associates are satisfactory, no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time to time. If we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements, if disputes with our unions arise, or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, we could experience a significant disruption of, or inefficiencies in, our operations or incur higher labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We have manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the world. Our international operations are subject to certain inherent risks, including:•exposure to local economic conditions;•adverse foreign currency fluctuations;•adverse currency exchange controls;•withholding taxes and restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings; •tax policies and regulations;•labor regulations;•tariffs;•government price and profit margin controls;•expropriations of property;•adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States;•the potential instability of foreign governments;•hostility from local populations and insurrections or armed conflicts;•risks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities;•export and import restrictions; and14Table of Contents •other changes in laws or government policies.The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable. Certain regions, including Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, are inherently more economically and politically volatile and, as a result, our business units that operate in these regions could be subject to significant fluctuations in sales and operating income from quarter to quarter. Because a significant percentage of our operating income in recent years has come from these regions, adverse fluctuations in the operating results in these regions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in future periods.In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export laws, anti-competition laws, anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, data privacy laws such as the GDPR, labor laws, tax laws, and accounting, internal control and disclosure requirements. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations. In certain foreign jurisdictions, there is a higher risk of fraud or corruption and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls and compliance programs. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws and regulations.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting government sanctions could result in significant macroeconomic consequences, including increased inflationary pressures, market volatility, economic restrictions and business disruptions, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.While it remains challenging to operate our business in Ukraine, we were able to resume shipments of tires into the country on a limited basis during the second quarter of 2022 and to expand our shipments during the second half of the year. In addition, we previously suspended all shipments of tires to Russia during the first quarter of 2022 and approved the discontinuation of our Russian operations in January 2023. These actions have not had and are not expected to have a direct material impact on our financial results. Nonetheless, the ongoing conflict has aggravated already challenging macroeconomic trends, including global supply chain disruptions, higher costs for certain raw materials and higher energy and transportation costs. The conflict has led to increases in the cost of energy and the potential for energy shortages, especially in Europe. We have taken steps to offset the increased cost, but we cannot predict the degree to or the time period over which energy costs will increase.In response to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine, a number of countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and members of the European Union, have implemented economic sanctions on Russia and certain Russian enterprises and individuals. The conflict could result in further sanctions and embargoes, regional instability and potential retaliatory action by the Russian government, including cyber-attacks. While we continue to take actions to ensure the safety of our associates and the continuity of our business operations, the extent of the conflict’s impact on the global economy cannot be predicted.Financial difficulties, work stoppages, supply disruptions or economic conditions affecting our major customers, dealers or suppliers could harm our business.The tire industry has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 2020 was characterized by a sudden and sharp decline in replacement tire demand and original equipment manufacturers suspending or severely limiting automobile production globally; the industry is still recovering. In addition, supply chain issues impacted new vehicle production throughout 2021 and 2022. As a result of these factors, automotive vehicle production and global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict.Although sales to our OE customers accounted for approximately 15% of our net sales in 2022, demand for our products by OE customers and production levels at our facilities are impacted by automotive vehicle production. Automotive production and sales are highly cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors, such as credit availability, interest rates, fuel prices, and consumer preference and confidence. Economic declines that result in a significant reduction in automotive production would have an adverse effect on our sales to OE customers. We may experience future declines in sales volume due to declines in new vehicle production and sales, the performance, discontinuation or sale of certain OE brands, platforms or programs, increased competition, or weakness in the demand for replacement tires, which could result in us incurring under-absorbed fixed costs at our production facilities or slowing the rate at which we are able to recover those costs. At various times, some regions around the world may be more particularly impacted by these factors than other regions.Automotive production can also be affected by the ongoing pandemic, labor relation issues or shortages, financial difficulties or supply disruptions. Our OE customers could experience production disruptions resulting from their own or supplier labor, 15Table of Contents financial or supply difficulties, or from government actions to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19. Such events may cause an OE customer to reduce or suspend vehicle production.  Other customers, such as dealers, retailers or distributors, may experience similar disruptions to their operations.  As a result, a customer could halt or significantly reduce purchases of our products, which would harm our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We cannot predict when customers will decide to increase or decrease inventory levels or whether new inventory levels will approximate historical inventory levels. Uncertainty and other unexpected fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.Our suppliers could also experience production disruptions due to the ongoing pandemic or labor, financial, supply or transportation difficulties, or new environmental laws or stricter enforcement of existing environmental laws. Any such production disruptions may result in the unexpected closure of our suppliers' facilities or increases in the cost of our raw materials, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the bankruptcy, restructuring or consolidation of one or more of our major customers, dealers or suppliers could result in the write-off of accounts receivable, a reduction in purchases of our products or a supply disruption to our facilities, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially adversely affected.Our business substantially depends on the continued service of key members of our management. The loss of the services of a significant number of members of our management could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, such as engineering, marketing and senior management professionals. Competition for these employees is intense, and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. Our ability to attract and retain employees may also be hampered by downturns in the automotive and tire industries, which could result in reduced payments under our incentive compensation plans, as well as by greater competition due to the increase in use of remote working environments. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting new high quality employees, our business could be materially adversely affected.Increasing competition for highly skilled and talented workers, as well as labor shortages, could adversely affect our business.A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us or increase labor costs, including high employment levels and government regulations. Although we have not experienced any material labor shortages to date, we have observed an increasingly competitive labor market. The increasing competition for highly skilled and talented employees has resulted, and could in the future result, in higher compensation costs and could result in difficulties in maintaining a capable workforce. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high-level, or if mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability, such as overtime and third-party outsourcing, have unintended negative effects, our business could be adversely affected. A sustained labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor cost inflation, caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, which could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing and distribution facilities and overall business and have other adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition. We have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales.We operate with significant operating and financial leverage. Significant portions of our manufacturing, selling, administrative and general expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with sales. In addition, a significant portion of our interest expense is fixed. There can be no assurance that we would be able to reduce our fixed costs proportionately in response to a decline in our net sales and therefore our competitiveness could be significantly impacted. As a result, a decline in our net sales could result in a higher percentage decline in our income from operations and net income.Environmental issues, including climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address environmental issues, may negatively affect our business and operations and cause us to incur significant costs.Our manufacturing and distribution facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect the environment, including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change, and we expect that additional requirements with respect to environmental matters, including reporting requirements, will be imposed on us in the future. In addition, we have contractual 16Table of Contents indemnification obligations for environmental remediation costs and liabilities that may arise relating to certain divested operations. There is also growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that issues related to such climate change have a negative effect on our business, we may be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain raw materials, including natural rubber. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may also disrupt the productivity of our facilities, our supply chain or the operations of our customers. If the frequency or severity of extreme weather and natural disasters increases over time, we may experience a greater number of losses at certain of our facilities. Such losses could lead to an increase in the deductibles or cost of insurance for those facilities, or to the unavailability of insurance on terms that are acceptable to us.Our manufacturing facilities may become subject to further limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases due to public policy concerns regarding climate change issues or other environmental or health and safety concerns. While the form of any additional regulations cannot be predicted, a “cap-and-trade” system similar to the one adopted in the European Union could be adopted in the United States. Any such “cap-and-trade” system (including the system currently in place in the European Union) or other limitations imposed on the emission of greenhouse gases could require us to increase our capital expenditures, use our cash to acquire emission credits or restructure our manufacturing operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.Material future expenditures may be necessary if compliance standards change, if material unknown conditions that require remediation are discovered, or if required remediation of known conditions becomes more extensive than expected. If we fail to comply with present and future environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production, which could harm our business or results of operations. Environmental laws could also restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses in connection with our manufacturing processes.Risks Related to Our Capital StructureOur long-term ability to meet our obligations, to repay maturing indebtedness or to implement strategic initiatives may be dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results.The adequacy of our liquidity depends on our ability to achieve an appropriate combination of operating improvements, financing from third parties and access to capital markets. We may need to undertake additional financing actions in the capital markets in order to ensure that our future liquidity requirements are addressed or to implement strategic initiatives. These actions may include the issuance of additional debt or equity, or the factoring of our accounts receivable.Our access to the capital markets cannot be assured and is dependent on, among other things, the ability and willingness of financial institutions to extend credit on terms that are acceptable to us or our suppliers, or to honor future draws on our existing lines of credit, and the degree of success we have in implementing our strategic initiatives. We have continued our use of supplier financing programs and the factoring of our accounts receivable in order to improve our working capital efficiency and reduce our costs. If these programs become unavailable or less attractive to us or our suppliers, our liquidity could be adversely affected.Future liquidity requirements, or our inability to access cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit, also may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. A substantial portion of our assets is subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness.Our inability to access the capital markets or incur additional debt in the future could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations, and could require us to consider further measures, including deferring planned capital expenditures, reducing discretionary spending, selling additional assets and restructuring existing debt.We have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health.We have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 31, 2022, our debt (including finance leases) on a consolidated basis was approximately $7.9 billion. Our substantial amount of debt and other obligations could have important consequences. For example, it could:•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;•impair our ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, acquisitions or general corporate requirements;17Table of Contents •increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;•limit our ability to use cash flows from operating activities in other areas of our business or to return cash to shareholders because we would need to dedicate a substantial portion of these funds for payments on our indebtedness;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.The agreements governing our debt, including our credit agreements, limit, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional debt and we may incur a significant amount of additional debt in the future, including additional secured debt. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, our ability to satisfy our debt obligations may become more limited.Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt and other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to our ability to implement our strategic initiatives, prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay expansion plans and capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that our operating performance, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient to pay our debt obligations when they become due. We cannot assure you that we would be able to dispose of material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt or other obligations if necessary or, even if we were able to take such actions, that we could do so on terms that are acceptable to us.Any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our debt instruments, or a material reduction in the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations.The agreements governing our secured credit facilities, senior unsecured notes and our other outstanding indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things:•incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock;•pay dividends, repurchase shares or make certain other restricted payments or investments;•incur liens;•sell assets;•incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us;•enter into affiliate transactions;•engage in sale/leaseback transactions; and•engage in certain mergers or consolidations or transfers of substantially all of our assets.Availability under our first lien revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory, the value of our principal trademarks, the value of eligible machinery and equipment, and certain cash in an amount not to exceed $275 million. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and inventory and other components of the borrowing base decline in value, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under that facility may decrease below its stated amount. In addition, if at any time the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under that facility exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to prepay borrowings and/or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess.Our ability to comply with these covenants or to maintain our borrowing base may be affected by events beyond our control, including deteriorating economic conditions, and these events could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures. We cannot assure you that such waivers, amendments or alternative financing could be obtained, or if obtained, would be on terms acceptable to us.A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in any of our existing or future financing agreements, including the financial covenants in our secured credit facilities, could result in an event of default under those agreements. Such a default could allow the lenders under our financing agreements, if the agreements so provide, to discontinue lending, to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, and/or to declare all borrowings outstanding thereunder to be due and payable. In addition, the lenders could terminate any commitments they have to provide us with further funds. If any of these events occur, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available 18Table of Contents to pay in full the total amount of obligations that become due as a result of any such acceleration, or that we will be able to find additional or alternative financing to refinance any such accelerated obligations. Even if we obtain additional or alternative financing, we cannot assure you that it would be on terms that would be acceptable to us.We cannot assure you that we will be able to remain in compliance with the covenants to which we are subject in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from our lenders or amend the covenants.Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.Certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, which would require us to use more of our available cash to service our indebtedness. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to enter into swap agreements or other hedging arrangements in the future if we desire to do so, or that any existing or future hedging arrangements will offset increases in interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $1.7 billion of variable rate debt outstanding.Risks Related to Information Technology and Intellectual PropertyWe may be adversely affected by any disruption in, or failure of, our information technology systems.We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology (""IT"") systems across all of our major business functions, including our research and development, manufacturing, retail, financial and administrative functions. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing upgrades when necessary, as well as the integration of Cooper Tire’s IT systems with Goodyear’s IT systems. Our security measures are focused on the prevention, detection and remediation of damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, cyber-attack, natural disasters and other similar disruptions. We may incur significant costs in order to implement the security measures that we feel are necessary to protect our IT systems. However, our IT systems may remain vulnerable to damage despite our implementation of security measures that we deem to be appropriate. In addition, we are also dependent on third parties to provide important IT services relating to, among other things, human resources, electronic communications and certain finance functions.We collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of our customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and associates, in data centers and on information technology networks. Additionally, we are subject to privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations (“Data Protection Laws”) in the United States and in jurisdictions around the globe that restrict the use, disclosure, transfer and processing of personal data. For example, we are subject to the GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), and the Brazilian Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados. Costs to comply with these Data Protection Laws are significant and the failure to comply with these laws could result in material legal exposure and business impact. The GDPR, for example, imposes onerous accountability obligations on companies, with penalties for non-compliance of up to the greater of €20 million or four percent of annual global revenue. The GDPR, and other Data Protection Laws, also grant corrective powers to supervisory authorities, including the ability to impose a limit on processing personal data or to order companies to cease operations. The Data Protection Laws are part of an evolving global data protection landscape in which the number, complexity, requirements and consequences of non-compliance with these laws are increasing. This landscape includes legislative proposals recently adopted or currently pending in the United States, at both the federal and state levels, as well as in other jurisdictions, implementing new or additional requirements for data protection that could further increase compliance costs, the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services, and significantly affect our business. Any system failure, accident or security breach involving our or our third party's IT systems could result in disruptions to our operations. A breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets, negatively impact our manufacturing or retail operations, or result in the compromise of personal information of our employees, customers or suppliers. While we have, from time to time, experienced system failures, accidents and security and privacy breaches involving our IT systems, these incidents have not had a material impact on our operations, and we are not aware of any resulting theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, material data or confidential information. To the extent that any system failure, accident or security or privacy breach results in material disruptions to our operations or the theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, material data or confidential information, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.19Table of Contents We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights adequately.Our success depends in part upon our ability to use and protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property, which generally covers various aspects of the design and manufacture of our products and processes. We own and use tradenames and trademarks worldwide. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. The steps we take in this regard may not be adequate to protect our intellectual property or to prevent or deter challenges or infringement or other violations of our intellectual property, and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights.In addition, the laws of some countries may not protect and enforce our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Further, while we believe we have rights to use all of the intellectual property we use, if we are found to infringe on the rights of others, we could be adversely impacted.Damage to our brand and reputation could have an adverse effect on our business.Our well-known and trusted brand names are a key competitive advantage. We believe that our future success depends, in part, on preserving, enhancing, and leveraging the value of our brands and executing our brand strategies, discussed above, which are designed to drive end-user demand for our products. A decline in the reputation of one or more of our brands as a result of deficiencies or defects in the design or manufacture of our products, or from legal proceedings, product recalls or warranty claims resulting from such deficiencies or defects, may harm our reputation, reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business.Risks Related to Litigation, Laws and RegulationsWe could be negatively impacted by changes in tariffs, trade agreements or other trade restrictions on imported tires, raw materials and other goods or equipment. The imposition of new tariffs, changes in existing tariff rates, changes in or the repeal of trade agreements or other trade restrictions may reduce our flexibility to utilize our global manufacturing footprint to meet demand for our tires around the world. In addition, the imposition of tariffs in the United States may result in the tires subject to such tariffs being diverted to other regions of the world, such as Europe, Latin America or Asia, or in retaliatory tariffs or other actions by affected countries. Broad-based tariffs and other trade restrictions could also increase costs for our suppliers who may increase prices to us. Finally, tariffs and other trade restrictions may weaken the economies of key markets for us, such as China, resulting in lower economic growth rates and weakened demand for our products and services. These factors, individually or together, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We may incur significant costs in connection with our contingent liabilities and tax matters.We have significant reserves for contingent liabilities and tax matters. The major categories of our contingent liabilities include workers' compensation and other employment-related claims, product liability and other tort claims, including asbestos claims, and environmental matters. Our recorded liabilities and estimates of reasonably possible losses for our contingent liabilities are based on our assessment of potential liability using the information available to us at the time and, where applicable, any past experience and recent and current trends with respect to similar matters. Our contingent liabilities are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable judicial or administrative decisions could occur that we did not anticipate. Such an unfavorable decision could include monetary damages, fines or other penalties or an injunction prohibiting us from taking certain actions or selling certain products. If such an unfavorable decision were to occur, it could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations in the period in which the decision occurs, or in future periods.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations, including with respect to transfer pricing. While we apply consistent transfer pricing policies and practices globally, support transfer prices through economic studies, seek advance pricing agreements and joint audits to the extent possible and believe our transfer prices to be appropriate, such transfer prices, and related interpretations of tax laws, are occasionally challenged by various taxing authorities globally. We have received various tax assessments challenging our interpretations of applicable tax laws in various jurisdictions. Although we believe we have complied with applicable tax laws, have strong positions and defenses and have historically been successful in defending such claims, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in the case we are unsuccessful in the defense of existing or future claims. If we wish to appeal any future adverse judgment in any of these proceedings, we may be required to post an appeal bond with the relevant court. If we were subject to a significant adverse judgment or experienced an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity, we may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.20Table of Contents We have significant deferred tax assets, including foreign tax credits. We must generate sufficient earnings of the appropriate character in order to utilize our deferred tax assets prior to any applicable expiration dates. If our earnings remain flat or decline over an extended period of time, we may not be able to utilize certain of our deferred tax assets prior to their expiration and we may need to record a valuation allowance against them that could materially adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which the valuation allowance is recorded.For further information regarding our contingent liabilities and tax matters, refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 20, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, and No. 7, Income Taxes. For further information regarding our accounting policies with respect to certain of our contingent liabilities and uncertain income tax positions, refer to “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies.”We are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating results.We are subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation through NHTSA, which has established various standards and regulations applicable to tires sold in the United States and tires sold in a foreign country that are identical or substantially similar to tires sold in the United States. NHTSA has the authority to order the recall of automotive products, including tires, having safety-related defects or that do not comply with a motor vehicle safety standard, and, in some cases, to assess penalties.The TREAD Act imposes numerous requirements with respect to the early warning reporting of warranty claims, property damage claims, and bodily injury and fatality claims and also requires tire manufacturers, among other things, to comply with revised and more rigorous tire testing standards. Compliance with the TREAD Act regulations has increased the cost of producing and distributing tires in the United States. We have been subject to recalls in the past and it is possible that a recall of our tires, including under the TREAD Act or in other countries under similar regulations, could occur in the future. A substantial recall or related penalties could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and financial condition.In addition, pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, NHTSA may establish a national tire fuel efficiency consumer information program. If a related rule-making process is completed, certain tires sold in the United States would be required to be rated for rolling resistance, traction and tread wear. While the federal law preempts state tire fuel efficiency laws adopted after January 1, 2006, we may become subject to additional tire fuel efficiency legislation, either in the United States or other countries.Our European operations are subject to regulation by the European Union. Two regulations, the Tire Safety Regulation and the Tire Labeling Regulation, applicable to tires sold in the European Union have been adopted. The Tire Safety Regulation sets performance standards that tires for cars and light and commercial trucks need to meet for rolling resistance, wet grip braking (passenger car tires only) and noise in order to be sold in the European Union. The Tire Labeling Regulation applies to all passenger car, light truck and commercial truck tires and requires that consumers be informed about the tire's fuel efficiency, wet grip and noise characteristics. Other countries, such as Brazil, have also adopted tire labeling regulations, and additional countries may also introduce similar regulations in the future.Tires produced or sold in Europe also have to comply with various other standards, including environmental laws such as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemical Substances), which regulates the use of chemicals in the European Union. For example, REACH prohibits the use of highly aromatic oils in tires, which were used as compounding components to improve certain performance characteristics.These U.S. and European regulations, rules adopted to implement these regulations, or other similar regulations that may be adopted in the United States, Europe or elsewhere in the future may require us to alter or increase our capital spending and research and development plans or cease the production of certain tires, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Laws and regulations governing environmental and occupational safety and health are complicated, change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time. As a manufacturing company, we are subject to these laws and regulations both inside and outside the United States. We may not be in complete compliance with such laws and regulations at all times. Our costs or liabilities relating to them may be more than the amount we have reserved, and that difference may be material.Compliance with the laws and regulations described above or any of the myriad of applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations currently in effect or that may be adopted in the future could materially adversely affect our competitive position, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.21Table of Contents General Risk Factors
We have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.The financial position and results of operations of many of our international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on our reported sales and operating margin (and conversely, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies has a positive impact). For the year ended December 31, 2022, foreign currency translation unfavorably affected sales by $1,114 million and unfavorably affected segment operating income by $16 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The volatility of currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results.We may be impacted by economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, including the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters.We manage businesses and facilities worldwide. Our facilities and operations, and the facilities and operations of our suppliers and customers, could be disrupted by events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes, or severe weather conditions or natural disasters. In addition, our operations could be adversely affected as a result of other disruptions at our facilities due to fire, electrical blackouts, power losses, telecommunications failures or other similar effects. Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales and customers. We may not be insured against all such potential losses and, if insured, the insurance proceeds that we receive may not adequately compensate us for all of our losses"
10,GT,GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER CO,2022-02-14,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when considering an investment decision with respect to our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If they do, our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be materially adversely affected. In such an instance, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment.Risks Related to the Cooper Tire AcquisitionWe may not achieve the intended benefits of the acquisition of Cooper Tire and our integration efforts may disrupt our current plans or operations.There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate Cooper Tire’s operations and assets or otherwise realize the expected benefits of the acquisition (including operating and other cost synergies). Difficulties in integrating Cooper Tire and Goodyear may result in Goodyear performing differently than expected, in operational challenges, in the failure to realize anticipated run-rate cost synergies and efficiencies in the expected timeframe or at all, or in the difficulty or failure of utilizing our available U.S. tax attributes, in which case the Cooper Tire acquisition may not be accretive to earnings per share, may not improve our balance sheet position, may not enhance our ability to delever and may not generate additional free cash flow due to reduced cash tax payments. The integration of the two companies may result in material challenges, including the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns; retaining key management and other employees; retaining or attracting business and operational relationships; the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process and associated expenses; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; coordinating geographically separate organizations; unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; as well as potential unknown liabilities or unforeseen expenses or delays relating to integration.Risks Related to OperationsOur future results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or similar public health crises, and that impact may be material.The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant volatility in the global economy. International, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities have taken extraordinary actions to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 throughout most regions of the world, including travel bans, quarantines, “stay-at-home” orders and similar mandates that caused many individuals to substantially restrict their daily activities and many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations.The tire industry has been negatively impacted by this evolving situation, particularly earlier in 2020, which was characterized by a sudden and sharp decline in replacement tire demand and original equipment manufacturers suspending or severely limiting automobile production globally. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or similar public health crises, may result in decisions to change future production levels based on an evaluation of market demand signals, inventory and supply levels, as well as our ability to continue to safeguard the health of our associates. We may experience unexpected delays or obstacles, such as disruptions in our and our customers' supply chains or government mandates, that may hamper our ability to achieve planned production levels. Further, we may not be able to operate at optimal levels of efficiency given new work rules and procedures that were or will be implemented to protect our associates, as well as potential increased absenteeism as a result of community spread of COVID-19. Any suspension of production at our manufacturing facilities, or difficulties or inefficiencies in resuming or increasing production, is likely to adversely impact our future results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and that impact may be material. In addition, our ability to continue implementing important strategic initiatives and capital expenditures may be reduced as we devote time and other resources to responding to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or similar public health crises.Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating and financing activities. Our cash flows from operating activities are driven primarily by our operating results and changes in our working capital requirements and our cash flows from financing activities are dependent upon our ability to access credit or other capital. If the COVID-19 pandemic worsens, our liquidity position may deteriorate. While we actively monitor our liquidity and took a number of actions aimed at mitigating the negative consequences of the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our cash flows and liquidity, our cash flows may decline if global economic activity declines or we are unable to have sufficient access to credit or other capital. For example, the borrowing base under our first lien revolving credit facility is dependent, in significant part, on our eligible 11Table of Contents accounts receivable and inventory, which would decline if our sales and production levels declined. Additionally, our European revolving credit facility contains a leverage ratio covenant applicable to Goodyear Europe B.V. and its subsidiaries.  While we are currently in compliance with this covenant, if we were unable to satisfy this covenant in the future or obtain a waiver from our lenders, we would no longer be able to access our €800 million European revolving credit facility or our pan-European accounts receivable securitization facility.The situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic remains fluid.  The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity will depend on future developments, such as the duration and scope of the pandemic, travel restrictions, government mandated restrictions and regulations, business and workforce disruptions, the impact on demand for our products, the effectiveness of actions taken to contain and treat the disease, including the efficacy of and ability to widely distribute vaccinations and therapeutics, and whether the pandemic leads to recessionary conditions in any of our key markets. Government-sponsored liquidity or stimulus programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may not be available to us or our customers or suppliers, and if available, may be insufficient to address the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, the ultimate impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity cannot be determined at this time.The COVID-19 pandemic has also exacerbated several of the risks disclosed below, including, but not limited to, the following (which are identified by their caption):•If we do not successfully implement our strategic initiatives, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.•Our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost-effective manner.•Raw material, energy and transportation costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.•Financial difficulties, work stoppages, supply disruptions or economic conditions affecting our major customers, dealers or suppliers could harm our business.•We have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales.•Increasing competition for highly skilled and talented workers, as well as labor shortages, could adversely affect our business.•Our long-term ability to meet our obligations, to repay maturing indebtedness or to implement strategic initiatives may be dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results.•We have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health.•Any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our debt instruments, or a material reduction in the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations.If we do not successfully implement our strategic initiatives, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.We are pursuing important strategic initiatives, such as our innovation excellence, sales and marketing excellence and operational excellence initiatives. Our innovation excellence initiatives are designed to create leading technologies, products and services that anticipate the mobility and sustainability needs of consumers and fleets. Our sales and marketing excellence initiatives are intended to capture the value of our brands and grow our market share, helping our customers win in their markets and ensuring we are the preferred choice of consumers. Our operational excellence initiatives are aimed at improving our safety, quality and efficiency and creating an advantaged supply chain that delivers the right tire, to the right place, at the right time, at the right cost. If we fail to execute these initiatives successfully or if the assumptions used in developing the initiatives vary significantly from actual conditions, we may fail to achieve our financial goals.We believe that our manufacturing footprint is less cost-competitive than that of our principal competitors. To begin to address this competitive disadvantage, we are curtailing production of tires for declining, less profitable segments of the tire market and undertaking significant capital investments in building, expanding and modernizing manufacturing facilities around the world to strengthen the competitiveness of our manufacturing footprint and increase production of premium, large-rim diameter consumer tires. The failure to implement successfully this or our other important strategic initiatives may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We continue to face distribution challenges in Europe which have adversely impacted our consumer replacement tire business in that region.  In 2021, we continued to address these challenges by taking actions to better align our European distribution network in order to capture the full value of our products and brands in the marketplace.  This initiative is ongoing and although 12Table of Contents significant progress has been made, the remaining changes we are pursuing to our distribution network in Europe could lead to continued disruption in our consumer replacement sales in 2022.  If we fail to address the distribution challenges that we face, or our plans to align our distribution network in Europe do not achieve the desired result, our competitive position may deteriorate and our operating results, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected.Our performance is also dependent on our ability to improve the volume and mix of higher margin tires we sell in our targeted market segments. In order to do so, we must be successful in developing, producing, marketing and selling products that consumers desire and that offer higher margins to us. Shifts in consumer demand away from higher margin tires could materially adversely affect our business. We have been capacity constrained from time to time with respect to the production of certain higher margin tires, particularly in the United States. When faced with these constraints, we try to alleviate them by utilizing our global manufacturing footprint to meet the demand for our tires and by adding manufacturing capacity. However, in spite of these initiatives, we may not be able to meet all of the demand for certain of our higher margin tires, which could harm our competitive position and limit our growth. We cannot assure you that our strategic initiatives will be successful. If not, we may not be able to achieve or sustain future profitability, which would impair our ability to meet our debt and other obligations and would otherwise negatively affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We face significant global competition and our market share could decline.New tires are sold under highly competitive conditions throughout the world. We compete with other tire manufacturers on the basis of product design, performance, price and terms, reputation, warranty terms, customer service and consumer convenience. On a worldwide basis, we have two major competitors, Bridgestone (based in Japan) and Michelin (based in France), that have large shares of the markets of the countries in which they are based and are aggressively seeking to maintain or improve their worldwide market share. Other significant competitors include Continental, Hankook, Kumho, Nexen, Pirelli, Sumitomo, Toyo, Yokohama and various regional tire manufacturers. Our competitors produce significant numbers of tires in low-cost countries, and have announced plans to further increase their production capacity in countries around the globe. Increasingly, our competitors are making decisions on where to produce tires based not only on production cost, but in combination with total delivery cost and supply chain reliability. These increases in production capacity may result in even greater competition in the United States and elsewhere.Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in significant part, on our ability to continue to innovate and manufacture the types of tires demanded by consumers, and to reduce costs by such means as reducing excess and high-cost capacity, leveraging global purchasing, improving productivity, eliminating redundancies and increasing production at low-cost supply sources. If we are unable to compete successfully, our market share may decline, materially adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the automotive industry may experience significant changes due to the introduction of new technologies, such as electric and autonomous vehicles, or new services, business models or methods of travel, such as ride sharing. As the automotive industry evolves, we may need to provide a wider range of products and services to remain competitive, including products that we do not currently have the capability to manufacture or services that we do not currently offer. The demand for our products may also decline if automotive production declines and/or total vehicle miles traveled declines, including as a result of increasing fuel costs. If we do not accurately predict, prepare for and respond to market developments, technological innovations and changing customer and consumer needs and preferences, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost-effective manner.Our capital expenditures are limited by our liquidity and capital resources and the amount we have available for capital spending is limited by the need to pay our other expenses and to maintain adequate cash reserves and borrowing capacity to meet unexpected demands that may arise. We believe that our ratio of capital expenditures to sales is lower than the comparable ratio for our principal competitors.Productivity improvements and manufacturing cost improvements may be required to offset potential increases in labor and raw material costs, including inflationary increases, and competitive price pressures. In addition, as part of our strategy to reduce high-cost and excess manufacturing capacity and to increase our capacity to produce higher margin tires, we may need to modernize or expand our facilities. We are currently undertaking significant construction, expansion and modernization projects globally.13Table of Contents We may not have sufficient resources to implement planned capital expenditures with minimal disruption to our existing manufacturing operations, or within desired time frames and budgets. Any disruption to our operations, delay in implementing capital improvements or unexpected costs may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.If we are unable to make sufficient capital expenditures, or to maximize the efficiency of the capital expenditures we do make, we may be unable to achieve productivity improvements, which may harm our competitive position, or to manufacture the products necessary to compete successfully in our targeted market segments. In addition, plant construction and modernization may temporarily disrupt our manufacturing operations and lead to temporary increases in our costs.Raw material, energy and transportation costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Raw material costs have historically been volatile. Inflationary cost pressures, among other factors, may cause increases in the prices of natural and synthetic rubber, carbon black and petrochemical-based commodities. Market conditions, including actions by competitors, or contractual obligations may prevent us from passing any such increased costs on to our customers through timely price increases. Additionally, increased demand for consumer products and supply chain disruptions as a result of the pandemic and other global events, including port congestion and container shortages, has led to inflationary cost pressures on transportation. Higher raw material, energy and transportation costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. High demand for and/or limited availability of raw materials and other energy sources could result in declining margins and operating results and adversely affect our financial condition. The volatility of raw material costs may cause our margins, operating results and liquidity to fluctuate. In addition, lower raw material costs may put downward pressure on the price of tires, which could ultimately reduce our margins and adversely affect our results of operations. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate sources of raw materials, energy or transportation, its operations could be interrupted. In addition, fluctuations in the price of gasoline for consumers can affect driving and purchasing habits and impact demand for tires.If we fail to extend or renegotiate significant collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions as they expire from time to time, or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.We are a party to collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions, which represent a significant number of our employees, including our collective bargaining agreements with the USW. The Goodyear agreement with the USW covers approximately 5,900 of our associates in the United States at December 31, 2021, and expires in July 2022, and the Cooper Tire agreements with the USW cover approximately 2,200 of our associates in the United States at December 31, 2021, and expire in June 2024. In addition, approximately 23,000 of our associates outside of the United States are covered by union contracts that have expired or are expiring in 2022, primarily in Luxembourg, Brazil, Poland, South Africa, France, China, Slovenia and Turkey. Although we believe that our relations with our associates are satisfactory, no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time to time. If we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements, if disputes with our unions arise, or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, we could experience a significant disruption of, or inefficiencies in, our operations or incur higher labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We have manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the world. Our international operations are subject to certain inherent risks, including:•exposure to local economic conditions;•adverse foreign currency fluctuations;•adverse currency exchange controls;•withholding taxes and restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings; •tax policies and regulations;•labor regulations;•tariffs;•government price and profit margin controls;•expropriations of property;14Table of Contents •adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States;•the potential instability of foreign governments;•hostility from local populations and insurrections or armed conflicts;•risks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities;•export and import restrictions; and•other changes in laws or government policies.The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable. Certain regions, including Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, are inherently more economically and politically volatile and, as a result, our business units that operate in these regions could be subject to significant fluctuations in sales and operating income from quarter to quarter. Because a significant percentage of our operating income in recent years has come from these regions, adverse fluctuations in the operating results in these regions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in future periods.In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export laws, anti-competition laws, anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, data privacy laws such as the GDPR, labor laws, tax laws, and accounting, internal control and disclosure requirements. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations. In certain foreign jurisdictions, there is a higher risk of fraud or corruption and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls and compliance programs. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws and regulations.Financial difficulties, work stoppages, supply disruptions or economic conditions affecting our major customers, dealers or suppliers could harm our business.The tire industry has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly earlier in 2020, which was characterized by a sudden and sharp decline in replacement tire demand and original equipment manufacturers suspending or severely limiting automobile production globally. In addition, supply chain issues impacted new vehicle production throughout 2021. As a result of these factors, automotive vehicle production and global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict.Although sales to our OE customers accounted for approximately 14% of our net sales in 2021, demand for our products by OE customers and production levels at our facilities are impacted by automotive vehicle production. We may experience future declines in sales volume due to declines in new vehicle production and sales, the performance, discontinuation or sale of certain OE brands, platforms or programs, increased competition, or weakness in the demand for replacement tires, which could result in us incurring under-absorbed fixed costs at our production facilities or slowing the rate at which we are able to recover those costs.Automotive production can also be affected by the ongoing pandemic, labor relation issues or shortages, financial difficulties or supply disruptions. Our OE customers could experience production disruptions resulting from their own or supplier labor, financial or supply difficulties, or from government actions to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19. Such events may cause an OE customer to reduce or suspend vehicle production.  Other customers, such as dealers, retailers or distributors, may experience similar disruptions to their operations.  As a result, a customer could halt or significantly reduce purchases of our products, which would harm our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our suppliers could also experience production disruptions due to the ongoing pandemic or labor, financial, supply or transportation difficulties, or new environmental laws or stricter enforcement of existing environmental laws. Any such production disruptions may result in the unexpected closure of our suppliers' facilities or increases in the cost of our raw materials, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the bankruptcy, restructuring or consolidation of one or more of our major customers, dealers or suppliers could result in the write-off of accounts receivable, a reduction in purchases of our products or a supply disruption to our facilities, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.15Table of Contents If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially adversely affected.Our business substantially depends on the continued service of key members of our management. The loss of the services of a significant number of members of our management could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, such as engineering, marketing and senior management professionals. Competition for these employees is intense, and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. Our ability to attract and retain employees may also be hampered by downturns in the automotive and tire industries, which could result in reduced payments under our incentive compensation plans, as well as by greater competition due to the increase in use of remote working environments. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting new high quality employees, our business could be materially adversely affected.We have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales.We operate with significant operating and financial leverage. Significant portions of our manufacturing, selling, administrative and general expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with sales. In addition, a significant portion of our interest expense is fixed. There can be no assurance that we would be able to reduce our fixed costs proportionately in response to a decline in our net sales and therefore our competitiveness could be significantly impacted. As a result, a decline in our net sales could result in a higher percentage decline in our income from operations and net income.Environmental issues, including climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address environmental issues, may negatively affect our business and operations and cause us to incur significant costs.Our manufacturing and distribution facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect the environment, including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change, and we expect that additional requirements with respect to environmental matters will be imposed on us in the future. There is also growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that issues related to such climate change have a negative effect on our business, we may be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain raw materials, including natural rubber. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may also disrupt the productivity of our facilities, our supply chain or the operations of our customers. If the frequency or severity of extreme weather and natural disasters increases over time, we may experience a greater number of losses at certain of our facilities. Such losses could lead to an increase in the deductibles or cost of insurance for those facilities, or to the unavailability of insurance on terms that are acceptable to us.Our manufacturing facilities may become subject to further limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases due to public policy concerns regarding climate change issues or other environmental or health and safety concerns. While the form of any additional regulations cannot be predicted, a “cap-and-trade” system similar to the one adopted in the European Union could be adopted in the United States. Any such “cap-and-trade” system (including the system currently in place in the European Union) or other limitations imposed on the emission of greenhouse gases could require us to increase our capital expenditures, use our cash to acquire emission credits or restructure our manufacturing operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.In addition, we have contractual indemnification obligations for environmental remediation costs and liabilities that may arise relating to certain divested operations. Material future expenditures may be necessary if compliance standards change, if material unknown conditions that require remediation are discovered, or if required remediation of known conditions becomes more extensive than expected. If we fail to comply with present and future environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production, which could harm our business or results of operations. Environmental laws could also restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses in connection with our manufacturing processes.Increasing competition for highly skilled and talented workers, as well as labor shortages, could adversely affect our business.A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us or increase labor costs, including high employment levels, federal unemployment subsidies, including unemployment benefits offered in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and other government regulations. Although we have not experienced any material labor shortages to date, we have observed an increasingly competitive labor market. The increasing competition for highly skilled and talented employees could result in higher compensation costs and difficulties in maintaining a capable workforce. If we are unable to hire and retain 16Table of Contents employees capable of performing at a high-level, or if mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability, such as overtime and third-party outsourcing, have unintended negative effects, our business could be adversely affected. A sustained labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor cost inflation, caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, which could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing and distribution facilities and overall business and have other adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition. Risks Related to Our Capital StructureOur long-term ability to meet our obligations, to repay maturing indebtedness or to implement strategic initiatives may be dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results.The adequacy of our liquidity depends on our ability to achieve an appropriate combination of operating improvements, financing from third parties and access to capital markets. We may need to undertake additional financing actions in the capital markets in order to ensure that our future liquidity requirements are addressed or to implement strategic initiatives. These actions may include the issuance of additional debt or equity, or the factoring of our accounts receivable.Our access to the capital markets cannot be assured and is dependent on, among other things, the ability and willingness of financial institutions to extend credit on terms that are acceptable to us or our suppliers, or to honor future draws on our existing lines of credit, and the degree of success we have in implementing our strategic initiatives. We have continued our use of supplier financing programs and the factoring of our accounts receivable in order to improve our working capital efficiency and reduce our costs. If these programs become unavailable or less attractive to us or our suppliers, our liquidity could be adversely affected.Future liquidity requirements, or our inability to access cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit, also may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. A substantial portion of our assets is subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness.Our inability to access the capital markets or incur additional debt in the future could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations, and could require us to consider further measures, including deferring planned capital expenditures, reducing discretionary spending, selling additional assets and restructuring existing debt.We have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health.We have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 31, 2021, our debt (including finance leases) on a consolidated basis was approximately $7.4 billion. Our substantial amount of debt and other obligations could have important consequences. For example, it could:•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;•impair our ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, acquisitions or general corporate requirements;•increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;•limit our ability to use cash flows from operating activities in other areas of our business or to return cash to shareholders because we would need to dedicate a substantial portion of these funds for payments on our indebtedness;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.The agreements governing our debt, including our credit agreements, limit, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional debt and we may incur a significant amount of additional debt in the future, including additional secured debt. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, our ability to satisfy our debt obligations may become more limited.Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt and other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to our ability to implement our strategic initiatives, prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay expansion plans and capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that our operating performance, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient to pay our debt obligations when they become due. 17Table of Contents We cannot assure you that we would be able to dispose of material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt or other obligations if necessary or, even if we were able to take such actions, that we could do so on terms that are acceptable to us.Any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our debt instruments, or a material reduction in the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations.The agreements governing our secured credit facilities, senior unsecured notes and our other outstanding indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things:•incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock;•pay dividends, repurchase shares or make certain other restricted payments or investments;•incur liens;•sell assets;•incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us;•enter into affiliate transactions;•engage in sale/leaseback transactions; and•engage in certain mergers or consolidations or transfers of substantially all of our assets.Availability under our first lien revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory, the value of our principal trademarks, the value of eligible machinery and equipment, and certain cash in an amount not to exceed $275 million. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and inventory and other components of the borrowing base decline in value, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under that facility may decrease below its stated amount. In addition, if at any time the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under that facility exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to prepay borrowings and/or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess.Our ability to comply with these covenants or to maintain our borrowing base may be affected by events beyond our control, including deteriorating economic conditions, and these events could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures. We cannot assure you that such waivers, amendments or alternative financing could be obtained, or if obtained, would be on terms acceptable to us.A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in any of our existing or future financing agreements, including the financial covenants in our secured credit facilities, could result in an event of default under those agreements. Such a default could allow the lenders under our financing agreements, if the agreements so provide, to discontinue lending, to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, and/or to declare all borrowings outstanding thereunder to be due and payable. In addition, the lenders could terminate any commitments they have to provide us with further funds. If any of these events occur, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available to pay in full the total amount of obligations that become due as a result of any such acceleration, or that we will be able to find additional or alternative financing to refinance any such accelerated obligations. Even if we obtain additional or alternative financing, we cannot assure you that it would be on terms that would be acceptable to us.We cannot assure you that we will be able to remain in compliance with the covenants to which we are subject in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from our lenders or amend the covenants.Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.Certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, which would require us to use more of our available cash to service our indebtedness. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to enter into swap agreements or other hedging arrangements in the future if we desire to do so, or that any existing or future hedging arrangements will offset increases in interest rates. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $1.1 billion of variable rate debt outstanding.18Table of Contents Risks Related to Information Technology and Intellectual PropertyWe may be adversely affected by any disruption in, or failure of, our information technology systems.We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology (""IT"") systems across all of our major business functions, including our research and development, manufacturing, retail, financial and administrative functions. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing upgrades when necessary, as well as the integration of Cooper Tire’s IT systems with Goodyear’s IT systems. Our security measures are focused on the prevention, detection and remediation of damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, cyber-attack, natural disasters and other similar disruptions. We may incur significant costs in order to implement the security measures that we feel are necessary to protect our IT systems. However, our IT systems may remain vulnerable to damage despite our implementation of security measures that we deem to be appropriate. In addition, we are also dependent on third parties to provide important IT services relating to, among other things, human resources, electronic communications and certain finance functions.Additionally, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of our customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and associates, in data centers and on information technology networks. In addition, the GDPR, which came into effect in May 2018, creates a range of new compliance obligations for companies that process personal data of European Union residents, and increases financial penalties for non-compliance. As a company that processes personal data of European Union residents, we bear the costs of compliance with the GDPR and are subject to the potential for fines and penalties in the event of a breach of the GDPR. Aside from the European Union, other jurisdictions have enacted, or are considering, regulations regarding data privacy.  The California Consumer Privacy Act (""CCPA""), which became effective in January 2020, and others that may be passed, introduce requirements with respect to personal information, and non-compliance with the CCPA may result in liability through private actions and enforcement. Failure to comply with these current and future laws could result in significant penalties and could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of our operations.Any system failure, accident or security breach involving our or our third party's IT systems could result in disruptions to our operations. A breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets, negatively impact our manufacturing or retail operations, or result in the compromise of personal information of our employees, customers or suppliers. While we have, from time to time, experienced system failures, accidents and security and privacy breaches involving our IT systems, these incidents have not had a material impact on our operations, and we are not aware of any resulting theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, material data or confidential information. To the extent that any system failure, accident or security or privacy breach results in material disruptions to our operations or the theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, material data or confidential information, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights adequately.Our success depends in part upon our ability to use and protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property, which generally covers various aspects of the design and manufacture of our products and processes. We own and use tradenames and trademarks worldwide. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. The steps we take in this regard may not be adequate to protect our intellectual property or to prevent or deter challenges or infringement or other violations of our intellectual property, and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights.In addition, the laws of some countries may not protect and enforce our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Further, while we believe we have rights to use all of the intellectual property we use, if we are found to infringe on the rights of others, we could be adversely impacted.Risks Related to Litigation, Laws and RegulationsWe could be negatively impacted by changes in tariffs, trade agreements or other trade restrictions on imported tires, raw materials and other goods or equipment. The imposition of new tariffs, changes in existing tariff rates, changes in or the repeal of trade agreements or other trade restrictions may reduce our flexibility to utilize our global manufacturing footprint to meet demand for our tires around the world. In addition, the imposition of tariffs in the United States may result in the tires subject to such tariffs being diverted to other regions of the world, such as Europe, Latin America or Asia, or in retaliatory tariffs or other actions by affected countries. 19Table of Contents Broad-based tariffs and other trade restrictions could also increase costs for our suppliers who may increase prices to us. Finally, tariffs and other trade restrictions may weaken the economies of key markets for us, such as China, resulting in lower economic growth rates and weakened demand for our products and services. These factors, individually or together, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We may incur significant costs in connection with our contingent liabilities and tax matters.We have significant reserves for contingent liabilities and tax matters. The major categories of our contingent liabilities include workers' compensation and other employment-related claims, product liability and other tort claims, including asbestos claims, and environmental matters. Our recorded liabilities and estimates of reasonably possible losses for our contingent liabilities are based on our assessment of potential liability using the information available to us at the time and, where applicable, any past experience and recent and current trends with respect to similar matters. Our contingent liabilities are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable judicial or administrative decisions could occur that we did not anticipate. Such an unfavorable decision could include monetary damages, fines or other penalties or an injunction prohibiting us from taking certain actions or selling certain products. If such an unfavorable decision were to occur, it could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations in the period in which the decision occurs, or in future periods.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations, including with respect to transfer pricing. While we apply consistent transfer pricing policies and practices globally, support transfer prices through economic studies, seek advance pricing agreements and joint audits to the extent possible and believe our transfer prices to be appropriate, such transfer prices, and related interpretations of tax laws, are occasionally challenged by various taxing authorities globally. We have received various tax assessments challenging our interpretations of applicable tax laws in various jurisdictions. Although we believe we have complied with applicable tax laws, have strong positions and defenses and have historically been successful in defending such claims, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in the case we are unsuccessful in the defense of existing or future claims. If we wish to appeal any future adverse judgment in any of these proceedings, we may be required to post an appeal bond with the relevant court. If we were subject to a significant adverse judgment or experienced an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity, we may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.We have significant deferred tax assets, including foreign tax credits. We must generate sufficient earnings of the appropriate character in order to utilize our deferred tax assets prior to any applicable expiration dates. If our earnings remain flat or decline over an extended period of time, we may not be able to utilize certain of our deferred tax assets prior to their expiration and we may need to record a valuation allowance against them that could materially adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which the valuation allowance is recorded.For further information regarding our contingent liabilities and tax matters, refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 20, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, and No. 7, Income Taxes. For further information regarding our accounting policies with respect to certain of our contingent liabilities and uncertain income tax positions, refer to “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies.”We are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating results.We are subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation through NHTSA, which has established various standards and regulations applicable to tires sold in the United States and tires sold in a foreign country that are identical or substantially similar to tires sold in the United States. NHTSA has the authority to order the recall of automotive products, including tires, having safety-related defects or that do not comply with a motor vehicle safety standard, and, in some cases, to assess penalties.The TREAD Act imposes numerous requirements with respect to the early warning reporting of warranty claims, property damage claims, and bodily injury and fatality claims and also requires tire manufacturers, among other things, to comply with revised and more rigorous tire testing standards. Compliance with the TREAD Act regulations has increased the cost of producing and distributing tires in the United States. We have been subject to recalls in the past and it is possible that a recall of our tires, including under the TREAD Act or in other countries under similar regulations, could occur in the future. A substantial recall or related penalties could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and financial condition.20Table of Contents In addition, pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, NHTSA may establish a national tire fuel efficiency consumer information program. If a related rule-making process is completed, certain tires sold in the United States would be required to be rated for rolling resistance, traction and tread wear. While the federal law preempts state tire fuel efficiency laws adopted after January 1, 2006, we may become subject to additional tire fuel efficiency legislation, either in the United States or other countries.Our European operations are subject to regulation by the European Union. Two regulations, the Tire Safety Regulation and the Tire Labeling Regulation, applicable to tires sold in the European Union have been adopted. The Tire Safety Regulation sets performance standards that tires for cars and light and commercial trucks need to meet for rolling resistance, wet grip braking (passenger car tires only) and noise in order to be sold in the European Union. The Tire Labeling Regulation applies to all passenger car, light truck and commercial truck tires and requires that consumers be informed about the tire's fuel efficiency, wet grip and noise characteristics. Other countries, such as Brazil, have also adopted tire labeling regulations, and additional countries may also introduce similar regulations in the future.Tires produced or sold in Europe also have to comply with various other standards, including environmental laws such as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemical Substances), which regulates the use of chemicals in the European Union. For example, REACH prohibits the use of highly aromatic oils in tires, which were used as compounding components to improve certain performance characteristics.These U.S. and European regulations, rules adopted to implement these regulations, or other similar regulations that may be adopted in the United States, Europe or elsewhere in the future may require us to alter or increase our capital spending and research and development plans or cease the production of certain tires, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Laws and regulations governing environmental and occupational safety and health are complicated, change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time. As a manufacturing company, we are subject to these laws and regulations both inside and outside the United States. We may not be in complete compliance with such laws and regulations at all times. Our costs or liabilities relating to them may be more than the amount we have reserved, and that difference may be material.Compliance with the laws and regulations described above or any of the myriad of applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations currently in effect or that may be adopted in the future could materially adversely affect our competitive position, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.General Risk Factors
We have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.The financial position and results of operations of many of our international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on our reported sales and operating margin (and conversely, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies has a positive impact). For the year ended December 31, 2021, foreign currency translation favorably affected sales by $164 million and favorably affected segment operating income by $2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The volatility of currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results.We may be impacted by economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters.We manage businesses and facilities worldwide. Our facilities and operations, and the facilities and operations of our suppliers and customers, could be disrupted by events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters. Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales and customers. We may not be insured against all such potential losses and, if insured, the insurance proceeds that we receive may not adequately compensate us for all of our losses"
12,GT,GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER CO,2021-02-09,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when considering an investment decision with respect to our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If they do, our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be materially adversely affected. In such an instance, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment.Our results of operations have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our future results of operations, financial condition and liquidity are expected to be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and that impact may be material.The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant volatility in the global economy and led to a dramatic reduction in economic activity worldwide. International, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities have taken extraordinary actions to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 throughout most regions of the world, including travel bans, quarantines, “stay-at-home” orders and similar mandates that have caused many individuals to substantially restrict their daily activities and many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations.The tire industry has been negatively impacted by this evolving situation, particularly earlier in 2020, which was characterized by a sudden and sharp decline in replacement tire demand and original equipment manufacturers suspending or severely limiting automobile production globally. Our results have been, and are likely to continue to be, adversely impacted by this economic disruption, including lower tire volume, sales, income and cash flow. In addition, our ability to continue implementing important strategic initiatives and capital expenditures may be reduced as we devote time and other resources toresponding to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.In March 2020, we announced the suspension of production at our manufacturing facilities in Europe and the Americas due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Production was suspended or significantly limited at most of our manufacturing facilities around the world during parts of the first half of 2020. During the second quarter of 2020, we completed a phased restart of most of our manufacturing facilities.  Most of our factories returned to full capacity by the end of the third quarter and remained at full capacity during the fourth quarter. Our decisions to change production levels in the future will be based on an evaluation of market demand signals, inventory and supply levels, as well as our ability to continue to safeguard the health of our associates. During 2021, we may experience unexpected delays or obstacles, such as disruptions in our supply chain or government mandates, that may hamper our ability to achieve planned production levels. Further, we will not be able to operate at optimal levels of efficiency given new work rules and procedures that were implemented to protect our associates and increased absenteeism as a result of community spread of COVID-19. Any suspension of production at our manufacturing facilities, or difficulties or inefficiencies in resuming or increasing production, is likely to adversely impact our future results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and that impact may be material.Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating and financing activities. Our cash flows from operating activities are driven primarily by our operating results and changes in our working capital requirements and our cash flows from financing activities are dependent upon our ability to access credit or other capital. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues for an extended period of time or worsens, our liquidity position may deteriorate. While we actively monitor our liquidity and took a number of actions aimed at mitigating the negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on our cash flows and liquidity, our cash flows from operating activities may decline if global economic activity remains low and we are unable to have sufficient access to credit or other capital. For example, the borrowing base under our first lien revolving credit facility is dependent, in significant part, on our eligible accounts receivable and inventory, which have declined as a result of our lower sales and production levels due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, our European revolving credit facility contains a leverage ratio covenant applicable to Goodyear Europe B.V. and its subsidiaries.  While we are currently in compliance with this covenant, if we were unable to satisfy this covenant in the future or obtain a waiver from our lenders, we would no longer be able to access our €800 million European revolving credit facility or our pan-European accounts receivable securitization facility.The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity will depend on future developments, such as the ultimate duration and scope of the pandemic, its impact on our customers and suppliers, how quickly normal economic conditions, operations and the demand for our products can resume, and whether the pandemic leads to recessionary conditions in any of our key markets. Government-sponsored liquidity or stimulus programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may not be available to us or our customers or suppliers, and if available, may be insufficient to address 10Table of Contents the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, the ultimate impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity cannot be determined at this time.The COVID-19 pandemic has also exacerbated several of the risks disclosed below, including, but not limited to, the following (which are identified by their caption): •If we do not successfully implement our strategic initiatives, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected. •Our long term ability to meet our obligations, to repay maturing indebtedness or to implement strategic initiatives may be dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results. •Financial difficulties, work stoppages, supply disruptions or economic conditions affecting our major customers, dealers or suppliers could harm our business. •Our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost-effective manner. •We have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health. •Any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our debt instruments, or a material reduction in the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations. •We have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales.If we do not successfully implement our strategic initiatives, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.Our results for 2020 were highly influenced by the severe economic disruption caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  The tire industry has been negatively impacted by this evolving situation, particularly earlier in the year, which was characterized by a sudden and sharp decline in replacement tire demand and original equipment manufacturers suspending or severely limiting automobile production globally.  Our results have been, and are likely to continue to be, adversely impacted by this economic disruption, including lower tire volume, sales, income and cash flow.  In this environment, global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict.We are pursuing important strategic initiatives, such as our operational excellence, sales and marketing excellence and innovation excellence initiatives. Our operational excellence initiatives are aimed at improving our manufacturing efficiency and creating an advantaged supply chain focused on reducing our total delivered costs, optimizing working capital levels and delivering best in industry customer service. Our sales and marketing excellence initiatives are intended to build the value of our brand, help our customers win in their markets, and become consumers' preferred choice. Our innovation excellence initiatives are designed to develop great products and services that anticipate and respond to the needs of consumers. If we fail to execute these initiatives successfully, we may fail to achieve our financial goals.We believe that our manufacturing footprint is less cost-competitive than that of our principal competitors. To begin to address this competitive disadvantage, we are curtailing production of tires for declining, less profitable segments of the tire market and undertaking significant capital investments in building, expanding and modernizing manufacturing facilities around the world to strengthen the competitiveness of our manufacturing footprint and increase production of premium, large-rim diameter consumer tires. The failure to implement successfully this or our other important strategic initiatives may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We continue to face distribution challenges in Europe which have adversely impacted our consumer replacement tire business in that region.  In 2020, we continued to address these challenges by taking actions to better align our European distribution network in order to capture the full value of our products and brands in the marketplace.  This project is ongoing and although significant progress has been made, the remaining changes we are pursuing to our distribution network in Europe could lead to continued disruption in our consumer replacement sales in 2021.  If we fail to address the distribution challenges that we face, or our plans to align our distribution network in Europe do not achieve the desired result, our competitive position may deteriorate and our operating results, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected.Our performance is also dependent on our ability to improve the volume and mix of higher margin tires we sell in our targeted market segments. In order to do so, we must be successful in developing, producing, marketing and selling products that consumers desire and that offer higher margins to us. Shifts in consumer demand away from higher margin tires could 11Table of Contents materially adversely affect our business. We have been capacity constrained from time to time with respect to the production of certain higher margin tires, particularly in the United States. When faced with these constraints, we try to alleviate them by utilizing our global manufacturing footprint to meet the demand for our tires and by adding manufacturing capacity. However, in spite of these initiatives, we may not be able to meet all of the demand for certain of our higher margin tires, which could harm our competitive position and limit our growth. We cannot assure you that our strategic initiatives will be successful. If not, we may not be able to achieve or sustain future profitability, which would impair our ability to meet our debt and other obligations and would otherwise negatively affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We face significant global competition and our market share could decline.New tires are sold under highly competitive conditions throughout the world. We compete with other tire manufacturers on the basis of product design, performance, price and terms, reputation, warranty terms, customer service and consumer convenience. On a worldwide basis, we have two major competitors, Bridgestone (based in Japan) and Michelin (based in France), that have large shares of the markets of the countries in which they are based and are aggressively seeking to maintain or improve their worldwide market share. Other significant competitors include Continental, Cooper, Hankook, Kumho, Nexen, Pirelli, Sumitomo, Toyo, Yokohama and various regional tire manufacturers. Our competitors produce significant numbers of tires in low-cost countries, and have announced plans to further increase their production capacity in those countries as well as the United States. These increases in production capacity may result in even greater competition in the United States and elsewhere.Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in significant part, on our ability to continue to innovate and manufacture the types of tires demanded by consumers, and to reduce costs by such means as reducing excess and high-cost capacity, leveraging global purchasing, improving productivity, eliminating redundancies and increasing production at low-cost supply sources. If we are unable to compete successfully, our market share may decline, materially adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the automotive industry may experience significant changes due to the introduction of new technologies, such as electric and autonomous vehicles, or new services, business models or methods of travel, such as ride sharing. As the automotive industry evolves, we may need to provide a wider range of products and services to remain competitive, including products that we do not currently have the capability to manufacture or services that we do not currently offer. The demand for our products may also decline if automotive production declines and/or total vehicle miles traveled declines. If we do not accurately predict, prepare for and respond to market developments, technological innovations and changing customer and consumer needs and preferences, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Raw material and energy costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Raw material costs have historically been volatile, and we may experience increases in the prices of natural and synthetic rubber, carbon black and petrochemical-based commodities. Market conditions, including actions by competitors, or contractual obligations may prevent us from passing any such increased costs on to our customers through timely price increases. Additionally, higher raw material and energy costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. As a result, higher raw material and energy costs could result in declining margins and operating results and adversely affect our financial condition. The volatility of raw material costs may cause our margins, operating results and liquidity to fluctuate. In addition, lower raw material costs may put downward pressure on the price of tires, which could ultimately reduce our margins and adversely affect our results of operations.If we fail to extend or renegotiate significant collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions as they expire from time to time, or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.We are a party to collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions, which represent a significant number of our employees. Our master collective bargaining agreement with the USW covers approximately 5,700 of our associates in the United States at December 31, 2020, and expires in July 2022. In addition, approximately 20,000 of our associates outside of the United States are covered by union contracts that have expired or are expiring in 2021, primarily in Germany, Luxembourg, China, Slovenia, France, Turkey, India and Mexico. Although we believe that our relations with our associates are satisfactory, no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time to time. If we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements, if disputes with our unions arise, or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, we could experience a significant 12Table of Contents disruption of, or inefficiencies in, our operations or incur higher labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We could be negatively impacted by the imposition of tariffs on imported tires and other goods. The imposition of tariffs on certain tires imported from China or other countries may reduce our flexibility to utilize our global manufacturing footprint to meet demand for our tires around the world. In addition, the imposition of tariffs in the United States may result in the tires subject to such tariffs being diverted to other regions of the world, such as Europe, Latin America or Asia, or in retaliatory tariffs or other actions by affected countries. Broad-based tariffs and other trade restrictions could also increase costs for our suppliers who may increase prices to us. Finally, tariffs and other trade restrictions may weaken the economies of key markets for us, such as China, resulting in lower economic growth rates and weakened demand for our products and services. These factors, individually or together, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We have manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the world. Our international operations are subject to certain inherent risks, including: •exposure to local economic conditions; •adverse foreign currency fluctuations; •adverse currency exchange controls; •withholding taxes and restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings;  •tax policies and regulations; •labor regulations; •tariffs; •government price and profit margin controls; •expropriations of property; •adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States; •the potential instability of foreign governments; •hostility from local populations and insurrections; •risks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities; •export and import restrictions; and •other changes in laws or government policies.The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable. Certain regions, including Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, are inherently more economically and politically volatile and, as a result, our business units that operate in these regions could be subject to significant fluctuations in sales and operating income from quarter to quarter. Because a significant percentage of our operating income in recent years has come from these regions, adverse fluctuations in the operating results in these regions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in future periods.In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export laws, anti-competition laws, anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, data privacy laws such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, tax laws, and accounting, internal control and disclosure requirements. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against 13Table of Contents us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations. In certain foreign jurisdictions, there is a higher risk of fraud or corruption and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls and compliance programs. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws and regulations.We have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.The financial position and results of operations of many of our international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on our reported sales and operating margin (and conversely, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies has a positive impact). For the year ended December 31, 2020, foreign currency translation unfavorably affected sales by $233 million and unfavorably affected segment operating income by $2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The volatility of currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results.Our long term ability to meet our obligations, to repay maturing indebtedness or to implement strategic initiatives may be dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results.The adequacy of our liquidity depends on our ability to achieve an appropriate combination of operating improvements, financing from third parties and access to capital markets. We may need to undertake additional financing actions in the capital markets in order to ensure that our future liquidity requirements are addressed or to implement strategic initiatives. These actions may include the issuance of additional debt or equity, or the factoring of our accounts receivable.Our access to the capital markets cannot be assured and is dependent on, among other things, the ability and willingness of financial institutions to extend credit on terms that are acceptable to us or our suppliers, or to honor future draws on our existing lines of credit, and the degree of success we have in implementing our strategic initiatives. We have continued our use of supplier financing programs and the factoring of our accounts receivable in order to improve our working capital efficiency and reduce our costs. If these programs become unavailable or less attractive to us or our suppliers, our liquidity could be adversely affected.Future liquidity requirements, or our inability to access cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit, also may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. A substantial portion of our assets is subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness.Our inability to access the capital markets or incur additional debt in the future could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations, and could require us to consider further measures, including deferring planned capital expenditures, reducing discretionary spending, selling additional assets and restructuring existing debt.Financial difficulties, work stoppages, supply disruptions or economic conditions affecting our major customers, dealers or suppliers could harm our business.The tire industry has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly earlier in 2020, which was characterized by a sudden and sharp decline in replacement tire demand and original equipment manufacturers suspending or severely limiting automobile production globally. As a result of the ongoing pandemic, automotive vehicle production and global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict.Although sales to our OE customers accounted for approximately 17% of our net sales in 2020, demand for our products by OE customers and production levels at our facilities are impacted by automotive vehicle production. We may experience future declines in sales volume due to declines in new vehicle sales, the performance, discontinuation or sale of certain OE brands, platforms or programs, increased competition, or weakness in the demand for replacement tires, which could result in us incurring under-absorbed fixed costs at our production facilities or slowing the rate at which we are able to recover those costs.Automotive production can also be affected by the ongoing pandemic, labor relation issues, financial difficulties or supply disruptions. Our OE customers could experience production disruptions resulting from their own or supplier labor, financial or supply difficulties, or from government actions to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19. Such events may cause an OE customer to reduce or suspend vehicle production.  Other customers, such as dealers, retailers or distributors, may 14Table of Contents experience similar disruptions to their operations.  As a result, a customer could halt or significantly reduce purchases of our products, which would harm our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our suppliers could also experience production disruptions due to the ongoing pandemic or labor, financial or supply difficulties, or new environmental laws or stricter enforcement of existing environmental laws. Any such production disruptions may result in the unexpected closure of our suppliers' facilities or increases in the cost of our raw materials, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the bankruptcy, restructuring or consolidation of one or more of our major customers, dealers or suppliers could result in the write-off of accounts receivable, a reduction in purchases of our products or a supply disruption to our facilities, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost-effective manner.Our capital expenditures are limited by our liquidity and capital resources and the amount we have available for capital spending is limited by the need to pay our other expenses and to maintain adequate cash reserves and borrowing capacity to meet unexpected demands that may arise.  In addition, we significantly reduced our capital expenditures in 2020 in order to preserve cash as part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  We believe that our ratio of capital expenditures to sales is lower than the comparable ratio for our principal competitors.Productivity improvements and manufacturing cost improvements may be required to offset potential increases in labor and raw material costs and competitive price pressures. In addition, as part of our strategy to reduce high-cost and excess manufacturing capacity and to increase our capacity to produce higher margin tires, we may need to modernize or expand our facilities. We are currently undertaking significant construction, expansion and modernization projects in the United States, Germany, Slovenia and Thailand.We may not have sufficient resources to implement planned capital expenditures with minimal disruption to our existing manufacturing operations, or within desired time frames and budgets. Any disruption to our operations, delay in implementing capital improvements or unexpected costs may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.If we are unable to make sufficient capital expenditures, or to maximize the efficiency of the capital expenditures we do make, we may be unable to achieve productivity improvements, which may harm our competitive position, or to manufacture the products necessary to compete successfully in our targeted market segments. In addition, plant construction and modernization may temporarily disrupt our manufacturing operations and lead to temporary increases in our costs.We have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health.We have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 31, 2020, our debt (including finance leases) on a consolidated basis was approximately $6.0 billion. Our substantial amount of debt and other obligations could have important consequences. For example, it could: •make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations; •impair our ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, acquisitions or general corporate requirements; •increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; •limit our ability to use cash flows from operating activities in other areas of our business or to return cash to shareholders because we would need to dedicate a substantial portion of these funds for payments on our indebtedness; •limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and •place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.The agreements governing our debt, including our credit agreements, limit, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional debt and we may incur a significant amount of additional debt in the future, including additional secured debt. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, our ability to satisfy our debt obligations may become more limited.15Table of Contents Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt and other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to our ability to implement our strategic initiatives, prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay expansion plans and capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that our operating performance, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient to pay our debt obligations when they become due. We cannot assure you that we would be able to dispose of material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt or other obligations if necessary or, even if we were able to take such actions, that we could do so on terms that are acceptable to us.Any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our debt instruments, or a material reduction in the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations.The agreements governing our secured credit facilities, senior unsecured notes and our other outstanding indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things: •incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock; •pay dividends, repurchase shares or make certain other restricted payments or investments; •incur liens; •sell assets; •incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us; •enter into affiliate transactions; •engage in sale/leaseback transactions; and •engage in certain mergers or consolidations or transfers of substantially all of our assets.Availability under our first lien revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory, the value of our principal trademarks, the value of eligible machinery and equipment, and certain cash in an amount not to exceed $200 million. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and inventory and other components of the borrowing base decline in value, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under that facility may decrease below its stated amount. In addition, if at any time the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under that facility exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to prepay borrowings and/or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess.Our ability to comply with these covenants or to maintain our borrowing base may be affected by events beyond our control, including deteriorating economic conditions, and these events could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures. We cannot assure you that such waivers, amendments or alternative financing could be obtained, or if obtained, would be on terms acceptable to us.A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in any of our existing or future financing agreements, including the financial covenants in our secured credit facilities, could result in an event of default under those agreements. Such a default could allow the lenders under our financing agreements, if the agreements so provide, to discontinue lending, to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, and/or to declare all borrowings outstanding thereunder to be due and payable. In addition, the lenders could terminate any commitments they have to provide us with further funds. If any of these events occur, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available to pay in full the total amount of obligations that become due as a result of any such acceleration, or that we will be able to find additional or alternative financing to refinance any such accelerated obligations. Even if we obtain additional or alternative financing, we cannot assure you that it would be on terms that would be acceptable to us.We cannot assure you that we will be able to remain in compliance with the covenants to which we are subject in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from our lenders or amend the covenants.16Table of Contents Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.Certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, which would require us to use more of our available cash to service our indebtedness. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to enter into swap agreements or other hedging arrangements in the future if we desire to do so, or that any existing or future hedging arrangements will offset increases in interest rates. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1.4 billion of variable rate debt outstanding.We have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales.We operate with significant operating and financial leverage. Significant portions of our manufacturing, selling, administrative and general expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with sales. In addition, a significant portion of our interest expense is fixed. There can be no assurance that we would be able to reduce our fixed costs proportionately in response to a decline in our net sales and therefore our competitiveness could be significantly impacted. As a result, a decline in our net sales could result in a higher percentage decline in our income from operations and net income.We may incur significant costs in connection with our contingent liabilities and tax matters.We have significant reserves for contingent liabilities and tax matters. The major categories of our contingent liabilities include workers' compensation and other employment-related claims, product liability and other tort claims, including asbestos claims, and environmental matters. Our recorded liabilities and estimates of reasonably possible losses for our contingent liabilities are based on our assessment of potential liability using the information available to us at the time and, where applicable, any past experience and recent and current trends with respect to similar matters. Our contingent liabilities are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable judicial or administrative decisions could occur that we did not anticipate. Such an unfavorable decision could include monetary damages, fines or other penalties or an injunction prohibiting us from taking certain actions or selling certain products. If such an unfavorable decision were to occur, it could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations in the period in which the decision occurs, or in future periods.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations, including with respect to transfer pricing. While we apply consistent transfer pricing policies and practices globally, support transfer prices through economic studies, seek advance pricing agreements and joint audits to the extent possible and believe our transfer prices to be appropriate, such transfer prices, and related interpretations of tax laws, are occasionally challenged by various taxing authorities globally. We have received various tax assessments challenging our interpretations of applicable tax laws in various jurisdictions. Although we believe we have complied with applicable tax laws, have strong positions and defenses and have historically been successful in defending such claims, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in the case we are unsuccessful in the defense of existing or future claims. If we wish to appeal any future adverse judgment in any of these proceedings, we may be required to post an appeal bond with the relevant court. If we were subject to a significant adverse judgment or experienced an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity, we may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.We have significant deferred tax assets, including foreign tax credits. We must generate sufficient earnings of the appropriate character in order to utilize our deferred tax assets prior to any applicable expiration dates. If our earnings remain flat or decline over an extended period of time, we may not be able to utilize certain of our deferred tax assets prior to their expiration and we may need to record an additional valuation allowance against them that could materially adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which the valuation allowance is recorded.For further information regarding our contingent liabilities and tax matters, refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 19, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, and No. 6, Income Taxes, in this Form 10-K. For further information regarding our accounting policies with respect to certain of our contingent liabilities and uncertain income tax positions, refer to “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies.”17Table of Contents We are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating results.We are subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, which has established various standards and regulations applicable to tires sold in the United States and tires sold in a foreign country that are identical or substantially similar to tires sold in the United States. NHTSA has the authority to order the recall of automotive products, including tires, having safety-related defects or that do not comply with a motor vehicle safety standard.The Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation Act, or TREAD Act, imposes numerous requirements with respect to the early warning reporting of warranty claims, property damage claims, and bodily injury and fatality claims and also requires tire manufacturers, among other things, to comply with revised and more rigorous tire testing standards. Compliance with the TREAD Act regulations has increased the cost of producing and distributing tires in the United States. We have been subject to recalls in the past and it is possible that a recall of our tires, including under the TREAD Act or in other countries under similar regulations, could occur in the future. A substantial recall could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and financial condition.In addition, pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, NHTSA may establish a national tire fuel efficiency consumer information program. If a related rule-making process is completed, certain tires sold in the United States would be required to be rated for rolling resistance, traction and tread wear. While the federal law preempts state tire fuel efficiency laws adopted after January 1, 2006, we may become subject to additional tire fuel efficiency legislation, either in the United States or other countries.Our European operations are subject to regulation by the European Union. In 2009, two regulations, the Tire Safety Regulation and the Tire Labeling Regulation, applicable to tires sold in the European Union were adopted. The Tire Safety Regulation sets performance standards that tires for cars and light and commercial trucks need to meet for rolling resistance, wet grip braking (passenger car tires only) and noise in order to be sold in the European Union. The Tire Labeling Regulation applies to all passenger car, light truck and commercial truck tires and requires that consumers be informed about the tire's fuel efficiency, wet grip and noise characteristics. Other countries, such as Brazil, have also adopted tire labeling regulations, and additional countries may also introduce similar regulations in the future.Tires produced or sold in Europe also have to comply with various other standards, including environmental laws such as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemical Substances), which regulates the use of chemicals in the European Union. For example, REACH prohibits the use of highly aromatic oils in tires, which were used as compounding components to improve certain performance characteristics.These U.S. and European regulations, rules adopted to implement these regulations, or other similar regulations that may be adopted in the United States, Europe or elsewhere in the future may require us to alter or increase our capital spending and research and development plans or cease the production of certain tires, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Laws and regulations governing environmental and occupational safety and health are complicated, change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time. As a manufacturing company, we are subject to these laws and regulations both inside and outside the United States. We may not be in complete compliance with such laws and regulations at all times. Our costs or liabilities relating to them may be more than the amount we have reserved, and that difference may be material.In addition, our manufacturing facilities may become subject to further limitations on the emission of “greenhouse gases” due to public policy concerns regarding climate change issues or other environmental or health and safety concerns. While the form of any additional regulations cannot be predicted, a “cap-and-trade” system similar to the one adopted in the European Union could be adopted in the United States. Any such “cap-and-trade” system (including the system currently in place in the European Union) or other limitations imposed on the emission of “greenhouse gases” could require us to increase our capital expenditures, use our cash to acquire emission credits or restructure our manufacturing operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.Compliance with the laws and regulations described above or any of the myriad of applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations currently in effect or that may be adopted in the future could materially adversely affect our competitive position, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.18Table of Contents We may be adversely affected by any disruption in, or failure of, our information technology systems.We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology, or IT, systems across all of our major business functions, including our research and development, manufacturing, retail, financial and administrative functions. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing upgrades when necessary. Our security measures are focused on the prevention, detection and remediation of damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, cyber-attack, natural disasters and other similar disruptions. We may incur significant costs in order to implement the security measures that we feel are necessary to protect our IT systems. However, our IT systems may remain vulnerable to damage despite our implementation of security measures that we deem to be appropriate.Any system failure, accident or security breach involving our IT systems could result in disruptions to our operations. A breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets, negatively impact our manufacturing or retail operations, or result in the compromise of personal information of our employees, customers or suppliers. While we have, from time to time, experienced system failures, accidents and security breaches involving our IT systems, these incidents have not had a material impact on our operations, and we are not aware of any resulting theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, material data or confidential information. To the extent that any system failure, accident or security breach results in material disruptions to our operations or the theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, material data or confidential information, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially adversely affected.Our business substantially depends on the continued service of key members of our management. The loss of the services of a significant number of members of our management could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, such as engineering, marketing and senior management professionals. Competition for these employees is intense, and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. Our ability to attract and retain employees may be hampered due to the current cyclical downturn in the automotive and tire industries, which has resulted in reduced payments under our incentive compensation plans over the last several years. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting new high quality employees, our business could be materially adversely affected.We may be impacted by economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters.We manage businesses and facilities worldwide. Our facilities and operations, and the facilities and operations of our suppliers and customers, could be disrupted by events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters. Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales and customers. We may not be insured against all such potential losses and, if insured, the insurance proceeds that we receive may not adequately compensate us for all of our losses. If the frequency or severity of natural disasters increases over time, we may experience a greater number of losses at certain of our facilities. Such losses could lead to an increase in the deductibles or cost of insurance for those facilities, or to the unavailability of insurance on terms that are acceptable to us"
8,GT,GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER CO,2020-02-11,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when considering an investment decision with respect to our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If they do, our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be materially adversely affected. In such an instance, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment.If we do not successfully implement our strategic initiatives, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.We continued to experience challenging global industry conditions in 2019, and our business was impacted by trends that negatively affected the tire industry in general.  These negative trends include higher raw material costs, foreign currency headwinds due to a strong U.S. dollar, lower OE industry volumes, softening demand in Europe, weak market conditions in China, and economic volatility in Latin America, particularly in Brazil.  Global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict.  If these overall trends continue or worsen, then our operational and financial condition could be adversely affected.In order to reduce the impact of these trends, we are pursuing important strategic initiatives, such as our operational excellence, sales and marketing excellence and innovation excellence initiatives. For example, in 2018, we formed TireHub, a new national tire distributor in the United States, which is expected to provide a superior, fully integrated distribution, warehousing, sales and delivery solution for our dealers. Our operational excellence initiatives are aimed at improving our manufacturing efficiency and creating an advantaged supply chain focused on reducing our total delivered costs, optimizing working capital levels and delivering best in industry customer service. Our sales and marketing excellence initiatives are intended to build the value of our brand, help our customers win in their markets, and become consumers' preferred choice.  Our innovation excellence initiatives are designed to develop great products and services that anticipate and respond to the needs of consumers. If we fail to execute these initiatives successfully, we may fail to achieve our financial goals.We believe that our manufacturing footprint is less cost-competitive than that of our principal competitors.  To begin to address this competitive disadvantage, we are curtailing production of tires for declining, less profitable segments of the tire market and undertaking significant capital investments in building, expanding and modernizing manufacturing facilities around the world to strengthen the competitiveness of our manufacturing footprint and increase production of premium, large-rim diameter consumer tires.  The failure to implement successfully this or our other important strategic initiatives may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We are also facing distribution challenges in Europe which have adversely impacted our consumer replacement tire business in that region.  We plan to address these challenges by taking actions to better align our European distribution network in order to capture the full value of our products and brands in the marketplace.  The changes we expect to pursue to our distribution network in Europe could lead to a disruption in our consumer replacement sales in 2020.  However, if we fail to address the distribution challenges that we face, or our plans to align our distribution network in Europe do not achieve the desired result, our competitive position may deteriorate and our operating results, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected.Our performance is also dependent on our ability to improve the volume and mix of higher margin tires we sell in our targeted market segments. In order to do so, we must be successful in developing, producing, marketing and selling products that consumers desire and that offer higher margins to us. Shifts in consumer demand away from higher margin tires could materially adversely affect our business. We have been capacity constrained from time to time with respect to the production of certain higher margin tires, particularly in the United States. When faced with these constraints, we try to alleviate them by utilizing our global manufacturing footprint to meet the demand for our tires and by adding manufacturing capacity. However, in spite of these initiatives, we may not be able to meet all of the demand for certain of our higher margin tires, which could harm our competitive position and limit our growth. We cannot assure you that our strategic initiatives will be successful. If not, we may not be able to achieve or sustain future profitability, which would impair our ability to meet our debt and other obligations and would otherwise negatively affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We face significant global competition and our market share could decline.New tires are sold under highly competitive conditions throughout the world. We compete with other tire manufacturers on the basis of product design, performance, price and terms, reputation, warranty terms, customer service and consumer convenience. On a worldwide basis, we have two major competitors, Bridgestone (based in Japan) and Michelin (based in France), that have large shares of the markets of the countries in which they are based and are aggressively seeking to maintain or improve their worldwide market share. Other significant competitors include Continental, Cooper, Hankook, Kumho, Nexen, Pirelli, Sumitomo, Toyo, Yokohama and various regional tire manufacturers. Our competitors produce significant numbers of tires in low-cost  8Table of Contentscountries, and have announced plans to further increase their production capacity in those countries as well as the United States.  These increases in production capacity may result in even greater competition in the United States and elsewhere.Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in significant part, on our ability to continue to innovate and manufacture the types of tires demanded by consumers, and to reduce costs by such means as reducing excess and high-cost capacity, leveraging global purchasing, improving productivity, eliminating redundancies and increasing production at low-cost supply sources. If we are unable to compete successfully, our market share may decline, materially adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the automotive industry may experience significant changes due to the introduction of new technologies, such as electric and autonomous vehicles, or new services, business models or methods of travel, such as ride sharing.  As the automotive industry evolves, we may need to provide a wider range of products and services to remain competitive, including products that we do not currently have the capability to manufacture or services that we do not currently offer. The demand for our products may also decline if automotive production declines and/or total vehicle miles traveled declines.  If we do not accurately predict, prepare for and respond to market developments, technological innovations and changing customer and consumer needs and preferences, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Raw material and energy costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Raw material costs have historically been volatile, and we may experience increases in the prices of natural and synthetic rubber, carbon black and petrochemical-based commodities. Market conditions, including actions by competitors, or contractual obligations may prevent us from passing any such increased costs on to our customers through timely price increases. Additionally, higher raw material and energy costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. As a result, higher raw material and energy costs could result in declining margins and operating results and adversely affect our financial condition. The volatility of raw material costs may cause our margins, operating results and liquidity to fluctuate. In addition, lower raw material costs may put downward pressure on the price of tires, which could ultimately reduce our margins and adversely affect our results of operations.If we fail to extend or renegotiate significant collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions as they expire from time to time, or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.We are a party to collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions, which represent a significant number of our employees. Our master collective bargaining agreement with the USW covers approximately 6,000 employees in the United States at December 31, 2019, and expires in July 2022. In addition, approximately 18,000 of our employees outside of the United States are covered by union contracts that have expired or are expiring in 2020, primarily in Germany, Poland, China, Slovenia, Turkey and Mexico.  Although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory, no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time to time. If we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements, if disputes with our unions arise, or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, we could experience a significant disruption of, or inefficiencies in, our operations or incur higher labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We could be negatively impacted by the imposition of tariffs on imported tires and other goods. The imposition of tariffs on certain tires imported from China or other countries may reduce our flexibility to utilize our global manufacturing footprint to meet demand for our tires around the world. In addition, the imposition of tariffs in the United States may result in the tires subject to such tariffs being diverted to other regions of the world, such as Europe, Latin America or Asia, or in retaliatory tariffs or other actions by affected countries. Broad-based tariffs and other trade restrictions could also increase costs for our suppliers who may increase prices to us.  Finally, tariffs and other trade restrictions may weaken the economies of key markets for us, such as China, resulting in lower economic growth rates and weakened demand for our products and services.  These factors, individually or together, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We have manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the world. Our international operations are subject to certain inherent risks, including:•exposure to local economic conditions;•adverse foreign currency fluctuations;•adverse currency exchange controls;•withholding taxes and restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings;  9Table of Contents•tax policies and regulations;•labor regulations;•tariffs;•government price and profit margin controls;•expropriations of property;•adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States;•the potential instability of foreign governments;•hostility from local populations and insurrections;•risks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities;•export and import restrictions; and•other changes in laws or government policies.The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable. Certain regions, including Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, are inherently more economically and politically volatile and, as a result, our business units that operate in these regions could be subject to significant fluctuations in sales and operating income from quarter to quarter. Because a significant percentage of our operating income in recent years has come from these regions, adverse fluctuations in the operating results in these regions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in future periods.In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions.  These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export laws, anti-competition laws, anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, data privacy laws such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, tax laws, and accounting, internal control and disclosure requirements.  Violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations.  In certain foreign jurisdictions, there is a higher risk of fraud or corruption and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls and compliance programs.  Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws and regulations.We have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.The financial position and results of operations of many of our international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on our reported sales and operating margin (and conversely, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies has a positive impact). For the year ended December 31, 2019, foreign currency translation unfavorably affected sales by $451 million and unfavorably affected segment operating income by $38 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The volatility of currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results.Our long term ability to meet our obligations, to repay maturing indebtedness or to implement strategic initiatives may be dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results.The adequacy of our liquidity depends on our ability to achieve an appropriate combination of operating improvements, financing from third parties and access to capital markets. We may need to undertake additional financing actions in the capital markets in order to ensure that our future liquidity requirements are addressed or to implement strategic initiatives. These actions may include the issuance of additional debt or equity, or the factoring of our accounts receivable.Our access to the capital markets cannot be assured and is dependent on, among other things, the ability and willingness of financial institutions to extend credit on terms that are acceptable to us or our suppliers, or to honor future draws on our existing lines of credit, and the degree of success we have in implementing our strategic initiatives. We have continued our use of supplier financing programs and the factoring of our accounts receivable in order to improve our working capital efficiency and reduce our costs. If these programs become unavailable or less attractive to us or our suppliers, our liquidity could be adversely affected. 10Table of ContentsFuture liquidity requirements, or our inability to access cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit, also may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. A substantial portion of our assets is subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness.Our inability to access the capital markets or incur additional debt in the future could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations, and could require us to consider further measures, including deferring planned capital expenditures, reducing discretionary spending, selling additional assets and restructuring existing debt.Financial difficulties, work stoppages, supply disruptions or economic conditions affecting our major customers, dealers or suppliers could harm our business.We experienced challenging global industry conditions in 2019, particularly in EMEA and Asia Pacific. As a result of these industry conditions, automotive vehicle production and global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict.Although sales to our OE customers accounted for approximately 20% of our net sales in 2019, demand for our products by OE customers and production levels at our facilities are impacted by automotive vehicle production. We may experience future declines in sales volume due to declines in new vehicle sales, the performance, discontinuation or sale of certain OE brands, platforms or programs, increased competition, or weakness in the demand for replacement tires, which could result in us incurring under-absorbed fixed costs at our production facilities or slowing the rate at which we are able to recover those costs.Automotive production can also be affected by labor relation issues, financial difficulties or supply disruptions. Our OE customers could experience production disruptions resulting from their own or supplier labor, financial or supply difficulties. Such events may cause an OE customer to reduce or suspend vehicle production. As a result, an OE customer could halt or significantly reduce purchases of our products, which would harm our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our suppliers could also experience production disruptions due to labor, financial or supply difficulties, or new environmental laws or stricter enforcement of existing environmental laws.  Any such production disruptions may result in the unexpected closure of our suppliers' facilities or increases in the cost of our raw materials, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the bankruptcy, restructuring or consolidation of one or more of our major customers, dealers or suppliers could result in the write-off of accounts receivable, a reduction in purchases of our products or a supply disruption to our facilities, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost-effective manner.Our capital expenditures are limited by our liquidity and capital resources and the amount we have available for capital spending is limited by the need to pay our other expenses and to maintain adequate cash reserves and borrowing capacity to meet unexpected demands that may arise. We believe that our ratio of capital expenditures to sales is lower than the comparable ratio for our principal competitors.Productivity improvements and manufacturing cost improvements may be required to offset potential increases in labor and raw material costs and competitive price pressures. In addition, as part of our strategy to reduce high-cost and excess manufacturing capacity and to increase our capacity to produce higher margin tires, we may need to modernize or expand our facilities.  We are currently undertaking significant construction, expansion and modernization projects in the United States, Germany, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Thailand.We may not have sufficient resources to implement planned capital expenditures with minimal disruption to our existing manufacturing operations, or within desired time frames and budgets. Any disruption to our operations, delay in implementing capital improvements or unexpected costs may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.If we are unable to make sufficient capital expenditures, or to maximize the efficiency of the capital expenditures we do make, we may be unable to achieve productivity improvements, which may harm our competitive position, or to manufacture the products necessary to compete successfully in our targeted market segments. In addition, plant construction and modernization may temporarily disrupt our manufacturing operations and lead to temporary increases in our costs. 11Table of ContentsWe have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health.We have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 31, 2019, our debt (including finance leases) on a consolidated basis was approximately $5.7 billion. Our substantial amount of debt and other obligations could have important consequences. For example, it could:•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;•impair our ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, acquisitions or general corporate requirements;•increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;•limit our ability to use cash flows from operating activities in other areas of our business or to return cash to shareholders because we would need to dedicate a substantial portion of these funds for payments on our indebtedness;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.The agreements governing our debt, including our credit agreements, limit, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional debt and we may incur a significant amount of additional debt in the future, including additional secured debt. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, our ability to satisfy our debt obligations may become more limited.Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt and other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to our ability to implement our strategic initiatives, prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we may be forced to reduce or eliminate the dividend on our common stock, reduce or delay expansion plans and capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that our operating performance, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient to pay our debt obligations when they become due. We cannot assure you that we would be able to dispose of material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt or other obligations if necessary or, even if we were able to take such actions, that we could do so on terms that are acceptable to us.Any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our debt instruments, or a material reduction in the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations.The agreements governing our secured credit facilities, senior unsecured notes and our other outstanding indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things:•incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock;•pay dividends, repurchase shares or make certain other restricted payments or investments;•incur liens;•sell assets;•incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us;•enter into affiliate transactions;•engage in sale/leaseback transactions; and•engage in certain mergers or consolidations or transfers of substantially all of our assets.Availability under our first lien revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory, the value of our principal trademarks, and certain cash in an amount not to exceed $200 million. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and inventory and other components of the borrowing base decline in value, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under that facility may decrease below its stated amount. In addition, if at any time the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under that facility exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to prepay borrowings and/or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess.Our ability to comply with these covenants or to maintain our borrowing base may be affected by events beyond our control, including deteriorating economic conditions, and these events could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or  12Table of Contentsalternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures. We cannot assure you that such waivers, amendments or alternative financing could be obtained, or if obtained, would be on terms acceptable to us.A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in any of our existing or future financing agreements, including the financial covenants in our secured credit facilities, could result in an event of default under those agreements. Such a default could allow the lenders under our financing agreements, if the agreements so provide, to discontinue lending, to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, and/or to declare all borrowings outstanding thereunder to be due and payable. In addition, the lenders could terminate any commitments they have to provide us with further funds. If any of these events occur, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available to pay in full the total amount of obligations that become due as a result of any such acceleration, or that we will be able to find additional or alternative financing to refinance any such accelerated obligations. Even if we obtain additional or alternative financing, we cannot assure you that it would be on terms that would be acceptable to us.We cannot assure you that we will be able to remain in compliance with the covenants to which we are subject in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from our lenders or amend the covenants.Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.Certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, which would require us to use more of our available cash to service our indebtedness. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to enter into swap agreements or other hedging arrangements in the future if we desire to do so, or that any existing or future hedging arrangements will offset increases in interest rates. As of December 31, 2019, we had $1,837 million of variable rate debt outstanding.We have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales.We operate with significant operating and financial leverage. Significant portions of our manufacturing, selling, administrative and general expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with sales. In addition, a significant portion of our interest expense is fixed. There can be no assurance that we would be able to reduce our fixed costs proportionately in response to a decline in our net sales and therefore our competitiveness could be significantly impacted. As a result, a decline in our net sales could result in a higher percentage decline in our income from operations and net income.We may incur significant costs in connection with our contingent liabilities and tax matters.We have significant reserves for contingent liabilities and tax matters.  The major categories of our contingent liabilities include workers' compensation and other employment-related claims, product liability and other tort claims, including asbestos claims, and environmental matters.  Our recorded liabilities and estimates of reasonably possible losses for our contingent liabilities are based on our assessment of potential liability using the information available to us at the time and, where applicable, any past experience and recent and current trends with respect to similar matters. Our contingent liabilities are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable judicial or administrative decisions could occur that we did not anticipate.  Such an unfavorable decision could include monetary damages, fines or other penalties or an injunction prohibiting us from taking certain actions or selling certain products.  If such an unfavorable decision were to occur, it could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations in the period in which the decision occurs, or in future periods.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations, including with respect to transfer pricing.  While we apply consistent transfer pricing policies and practices globally, support transfer prices through economic studies, seek advance pricing agreements and joint audits to the extent possible and believe our transfer prices to be appropriate, such transfer prices, and related interpretations of tax laws, are occasionally challenged by various taxing authorities globally.  We have received various tax assessments challenging our interpretations of applicable tax laws in various jurisdictions.  Although we believe we have complied with applicable tax laws, have strong positions and defenses and have historically been successful in defending such claims, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in the case we are unsuccessful in the defense of existing or future claims. If we wish to appeal any future adverse judgment in any of these proceedings, we may be required to post an appeal bond with the relevant court.  If we were subject to a significant adverse judgment or experienced an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity, we may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.We have significant deferred tax assets, including foreign tax credits. We must generate sufficient earnings of the appropriate character in order to utilize our deferred tax assets prior to any applicable expiration dates.  If our earnings remain flat or decline over an extended period of time, we may not be able to utilize certain of our deferred tax assets prior to their expiration and we  13Table of Contentsmay need to record a valuation allowance against them that could materially adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which the valuation allowance is recorded.For further information regarding our contingent liabilities and tax matters, refer to  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 19, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, and No. 6, Income Taxes.  For further information regarding our accounting policies with respect to certain of our contingent liabilities and uncertain income tax positions, refer to “Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies.”We are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating results.We are subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, which has established various standards and regulations applicable to tires sold in the United States and tires sold in a foreign country that are identical or substantially similar to tires sold in the United States. NHTSA has the authority to order the recall of automotive products, including tires, having safety-related defects or that do not comply with a motor vehicle safety standard.The Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation Act, or TREAD Act, imposes numerous requirements with respect to the early warning reporting of warranty claims, property damage claims, and bodily injury and fatality claims and also requires tire manufacturers, among other things, to comply with revised and more rigorous tire testing standards. Compliance with the TREAD Act regulations has increased the cost of producing and distributing tires in the United States. We have been subject to recalls in the past and it is possible that a recall of our tires, including under the TREAD Act or in other countries under similar regulations, could occur in the future. A substantial recall could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and financial condition.In addition, as required by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, NHTSA will establish a national tire fuel efficiency consumer information program. When the related rule-making process is completed, certain tires sold in the United States will be required to be rated for rolling resistance, traction and tread wear. While the federal law preempts state tire fuel efficiency laws adopted after January 1, 2006, we may become subject to additional tire fuel efficiency legislation, either in the United States or other countries.Our European operations are subject to regulation by the European Union. In 2009, two regulations, the Tire Safety Regulation and the Tire Labeling Regulation, applicable to tires sold in the European Union were adopted. The Tire Safety Regulation sets performance standards that tires for cars and light and commercial trucks need to meet for rolling resistance, wet grip braking (passenger car tires only) and noise in order to be sold in the European Union, and became effective beginning in 2012, with continuing phases that will become effective through 2020. The Tire Labeling Regulation applies to all passenger car, light truck and commercial truck tires and requires that consumers be informed about the tire's fuel efficiency, wet grip and noise characteristics. Other countries, such as Brazil, have also adopted tire labeling regulations, and additional countries may also introduce similar regulations in the future.Tires produced or sold in Europe also have to comply with various other standards, including environmental laws such as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemical Substances), which regulates the use of chemicals in the European Union. For example, REACH prohibits the use of highly aromatic oils in tires, which were used as compounding components to improve certain performance characteristics.These U.S. and European regulations, rules adopted to implement these regulations, or other similar regulations that may be adopted in the United States, Europe or elsewhere in the future may require us to alter or increase our capital spending and research and development plans or cease the production of certain tires, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Laws and regulations governing environmental and occupational safety and health are complicated, change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time. As a manufacturing company, we are subject to these laws and regulations both inside and outside the United States. We may not be in complete compliance with such laws and regulations at all times. Our costs or liabilities relating to them may be more than the amount we have reserved, and that difference may be material.In addition, our manufacturing facilities may become subject to further limitations on the emission of “greenhouse gases” due to public policy concerns regarding climate change issues or other environmental or health and safety concerns. While the form of any additional regulations cannot be predicted, a “cap-and-trade” system similar to the one adopted in the European Union could be adopted in the United States. Any such “cap-and-trade” system (including the system currently in place in the European Union) or other limitations imposed on the emission of “greenhouse gases” could require us to increase our capital expenditures, use our cash to acquire emission credits or restructure our manufacturing operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.Compliance with the laws and regulations described above or any of the myriad of applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations currently in effect or that may be adopted in the future could materially adversely affect our competitive position, operating results, financial condition and liquidity. 14Table of ContentsWe may be adversely affected by any disruption in, or failure of, our information technology systems.We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology, or IT, systems across all of our major business functions, including our research and development, manufacturing, retail, financial and administrative functions.  We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing upgrades when necessary.  Our security measures are focused on the prevention, detection and remediation of damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, cyber-attack, natural disasters and other similar disruptions.  We may incur significant costs in order to implement the security measures that we feel are necessary to protect our IT systems. However, our IT systems may remain vulnerable to damage despite our implementation of security measures that we deem to be appropriate.Any system failure, accident or security breach involving our IT systems could result in disruptions to our operations.  A breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets, negatively impact our manufacturing or retail operations, or result in the compromise of personal information of our employees, customers or suppliers. While we have, from time to time, experienced system failures, accidents and security breaches involving our IT systems, these incidents have not had a material impact on our operations, and we are not aware of any resulting theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, material data or confidential information. To the extent that any system failure, accident or security breach results in material disruptions to our operations or the theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, material data or confidential information, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially adversely affected.Our business substantially depends on the continued service of key members of our management. The loss of the services of a significant number of members of our management could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, such as engineering, marketing and senior management professionals. Competition for these employees is intense, and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. Our ability to attract and retain employees may be hampered due to the current cyclical downturn in the automotive and tire industries, which has resulted in reduced payments under our incentive compensation plans over the last several years. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting new high quality employees, our business could be materially adversely affected.We may be impacted by economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters.We manage businesses and facilities worldwide. Our facilities and operations, and the facilities and operations of our suppliers and customers, could be disrupted by events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters. Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales and customers. We may not be insured against all such potential losses and, if insured, the insurance proceeds that we receive may not adequately compensate us for all of our losses.  If the frequency or severity of natural disasters increases over time, we may experience a greater number of losses at certain of our facilities.  Such losses could lead to an increase in the deductibles or cost of insurance for those facilities, or to the unavailability of insurance on terms that are acceptable to us"
9,GT,GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER CO,2019-02-08,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when considering an investment decision with respect to our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If they do, our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be materially adversely affected. In such an instance, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment.If we do not successfully implement our strategic initiatives, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.We continued to experience challenging global industry conditions in 2018, and our business was impacted by trends that negatively affected the tire industry in general.  These negative trends include higher raw material costs, foreign currency headwinds due to a strong U.S. dollar, and volatility in emerging markets, including softening industry conditions in China.  Global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict.  If these overall trends continue or worsen, then our operational and financial condition could be adversely affected.In order to reduce the impact of these trends, we are pursuing important strategic initiatives, such as our operational excellence, sales and marketing excellence and innovation excellence initiatives. For example, in 2018, we formed TireHub, a new national tire distributor in the United States, which is expected to provide a superior, fully integrated distribution, warehousing, sales and delivery solution for our dealers. We are also undertaking significant capital investments in building, expanding and modernizing manufacturing facilities around the world, including a new manufacturing facility in San Luis Potosi, Mexico that is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2019. The failure to implement successfully our important strategic initiatives may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.Our operational excellence initiatives are aimed at improving our manufacturing efficiency and creating an advantaged supply chain focused on reducing our total delivered costs, optimizing working capital levels and delivering best in industry customer service. Our sales and marketing excellence initiatives are intended to build the value of our brand, help our customers win in their markets, and become consumers' preferred choice.  Our innovation excellence initiatives are designed to develop great products and services that anticipate and respond to the needs of consumers. If we fail to execute these initiatives successfully, we may fail to achieve our financial goals.Our performance is also dependent on our ability to improve the volume and mix of higher margin tires we sell in our targeted market segments. In order to do so, we must be successful in developing, producing, marketing and selling products that consumers' desire and that offer higher margins to us. Shifts in consumer demand away from higher margin tires could materially adversely affect our business. We have been capacity constrained from time to time with respect to the production of certain higher margin tires, particularly in the United States. We plan to alleviate these constraints by utilizing our global manufacturing footprint to meet the demand for our tires and by adding manufacturing capacity. However, in spite of these initiatives, we may not be able to meet all of the demand for certain of our higher margin tires, which could harm our competitive position and limit our growth. We cannot assure you that our strategic initiatives will be successful. If not, we may not be able to achieve or sustain future profitability, which would impair our ability to meet our debt and other obligations and would otherwise negatively affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We face significant global competition and our market share could decline.New tires are sold under highly competitive conditions throughout the world. We compete with other tire manufacturers on the basis of product design, performance, price and terms, reputation, warranty terms, customer service and consumer convenience. On a worldwide basis, we have two major competitors, Bridgestone (based in Japan) and Michelin (based in France), that have large shares of the markets of the countries in which they are based and are aggressively seeking to maintain or improve their worldwide market share. Other significant competitors include Continental, Cooper, Hankook, Kumho, Pirelli, Sumitomo, Toyo, Yokohama and various regional tire manufacturers. Our competitors produce significant numbers of tires in low-cost countries, and have announced plans to further increase their production capacity in those countries as well as the United States.  These increases in production capacity may result in even greater competition in the United States and elsewhere.Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in significant part, on our ability to continue to innovate and manufacture the types of tires demanded by consumers, and to reduce costs by such means as reducing excess and high-cost capacity, leveraging global purchasing, improving productivity, eliminating redundancies and increasing production at low-cost supply sources. If we are unable to compete successfully, our market share may decline, materially adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the automotive industry may experience significant changes due to the introduction of new technologies, such as electric and autonomous vehicles, or new services, business models or methods of travel, such as ride sharing.  As the automotive industry evolves, we may need to provide a wider range of products and services to remain competitive, including products that  9Table of Contentswe do not currently have the capability to manufacture or services that we do not currently offer. The demand for our products may also decline if automotive production declines and/or total vehicle miles traveled declines.  If we do not accurately predict, prepare for and respond to market developments, technological innovations and changing customer and consumer needs and preferences, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Raw material and energy costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Raw material costs have historically been volatile, and we may experience increases in the prices of natural and synthetic rubber, carbon black and petrochemical-based commodities. Market conditions, including actions by competitors, or contractual obligations may prevent us from passing any such increased costs on to our customers through timely price increases. Additionally, higher raw material and energy costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. As a result, higher raw material and energy costs could result in declining margins and operating results and adversely affect our financial condition. The volatility of raw material costs may cause our margins, operating results and liquidity to fluctuate. In addition, lower raw material costs may put downward pressure on the price of tires, which could ultimately reduce our margins and adversely affect our results of operations.If we fail to extend or renegotiate significant collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions as they expire from time to time, or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.We are a party to collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions, which represent a significant number of our employees. Our master collective bargaining agreement with the USW covers approximately 7,000 employees in the United States at December 31, 2018, and expires in July 2022. In addition, approximately 15,000 of our employees outside of the United States are covered by union contracts that have expired or are expiring in 2019, primarily in Luxembourg, China, South Africa, France and Turkey. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory, no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time to time. If we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements, if disputes with our unions arise, or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, we could experience a significant disruption of, or inefficiencies in, our operations or incur higher labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We could be negatively impacted by the imposition of tariffs on imported tires and other goods. The imposition of tariffs on certain tires imported from China or other countries may reduce our flexibility to utilize our global manufacturing footprint to meet demand for our tires around the world. In addition, the imposition of tariffs in the United States may result in the tires subject to such tariffs being diverted to other regions of the world, such as Europe, Latin America or Asia, or in retaliatory tariffs or other actions by affected countries. Broad-based tariffs and other trade restrictions could also increase costs for our suppliers who may increase prices to us.  Finally, tariffs and other trade restrictions may weaken the economies of key markets for us, such as China, resulting in lower economic growth rates and weakened demand for our products and services.  These factors, individually or together, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We have manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the world. Our international operations are subject to certain inherent risks, including:•exposure to local economic conditions;•adverse foreign currency fluctuations;•adverse currency exchange controls;•withholding taxes and restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings; •tax policies and regulations;•labor regulations;•tariffs;•government price and profit margin controls;•expropriations of property;•adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States;•the potential instability of foreign governments; 10Table of Contents•hostility from local populations and insurrections;•risks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities;•export and import restrictions; and•other changes in laws or government policies.The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable. Certain regions, including Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, are inherently more economically and politically volatile and, as a result, our business units that operate in these regions could be subject to significant fluctuations in sales and operating income from quarter to quarter. Because a significant percentage of our operating income in recent years has come from these regions, adverse fluctuations in the operating results in these regions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in future periods.In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions.  These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export laws, anti-competition laws, anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, data privacy laws such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, tax laws, and accounting, internal control and disclosure requirements.  Violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations.  In certain foreign jurisdictions, there is a higher risk of fraud or corruption and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls and compliance programs.  Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws and regulations.We have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.The financial position and results of operations of many of our international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on our reported sales and operating margin (and conversely, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies has a positive impact). For the year ended December 31, 2018, foreign currency translation unfavorably affected sales by $139 million and unfavorably affected segment operating income by $31 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The volatility of currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results.Our long term ability to meet our obligations, to repay maturing indebtedness or to implement strategic initiatives may be dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results.The adequacy of our liquidity depends on our ability to achieve an appropriate combination of operating improvements, financing from third parties and access to capital markets. We may need to undertake additional financing actions in the capital markets in order to ensure that our future liquidity requirements are addressed or to implement strategic initiatives. These actions may include the issuance of additional debt or equity, or the factoring of our accounts receivable.Our access to the capital markets cannot be assured and is dependent on, among other things, the ability and willingness of financial institutions to extend credit on terms that are acceptable to us or our suppliers, or to honor future draws on our existing lines of credit, and the degree of success we have in implementing our strategic initiatives. We have continued our use of supplier financing programs and the factoring of our accounts receivable in order to improve our working capital efficiency and reduce our costs. If these programs become unavailable or less attractive to us or our suppliers, our liquidity could be adversely affected.Future liquidity requirements, or our inability to access cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit, also may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. A substantial portion of our assets is subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness.Our inability to access the capital markets or incur additional debt in the future could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations, and could require us to consider further measures, including deferring planned capital expenditures, reducing discretionary spending, selling additional assets and restructuring existing debt.Financial difficulties, work stoppages, supply disruptions or economic conditions affecting our major customers, dealers or suppliers could harm our business.We experienced challenging global industry conditions in 2018, particularly in Americas and Asia Pacific. As a result of these industry conditions, automotive vehicle production and global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict. 11Table of ContentsAlthough sales to our OE customers accounted for approximately 20% of our net sales in 2018, demand for our products by OE customers and production levels at our facilities are impacted by automotive vehicle production. We may experience future declines in sales volume due to declines in new vehicle sales, the performance, discontinuation or sale of certain OE brands, platforms or programs, increased competition, or weakness in the demand for replacement tires, which could result in us incurring under-absorbed fixed costs at our production facilities or slowing the rate at which we are able to recover those costs.Automotive production can also be affected by labor relation issues, financial difficulties or supply disruptions. Our OE customers could experience production disruptions resulting from their own or supplier labor, financial or supply difficulties. Such events may cause an OE customer to reduce or suspend vehicle production. As a result, an OE customer could halt or significantly reduce purchases of our products, which would harm our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our suppliers could also experience production disruptions due to labor, financial or supply difficulties, or new environmental laws or stricter enforcement of existing environmental laws.  Any such production disruptions may result in the unexpected closure of our suppliers' facilities or increases in the cost of our raw materials, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the bankruptcy, restructuring or consolidation of one or more of our major customers, dealers or suppliers could result in the write-off of accounts receivable, a reduction in purchases of our products or a supply disruption to our facilities, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost-effective manner.Our capital expenditures are limited by our liquidity and capital resources and the amount we have available for capital spending is limited by the need to pay our other expenses and to maintain adequate cash reserves and borrowing capacity to meet unexpected demands that may arise. We believe that our ratio of capital expenditures to sales is lower than the comparable ratio for our principal competitors.Productivity improvements and manufacturing cost improvements may be required to offset potential increases in labor and raw material costs and competitive price pressures. In addition, as part of our strategy to reduce high-cost and excess manufacturing capacity and to increase our capacity to produce higher margin tires, we may need to modernize or expand our facilities.  We are currently undertaking significant construction, expansion and modernization projects in China, India, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Thailand.We may not have sufficient resources to implement planned capital expenditures with minimal disruption to our existing manufacturing operations, or within desired time frames and budgets. Any disruption to our operations, delay in implementing capital improvements or unexpected costs may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.If we are unable to make sufficient capital expenditures, or to maximize the efficiency of the capital expenditures we do make, we may be unable to achieve productivity improvements, which may harm our competitive position, or to manufacture the products necessary to compete successfully in our targeted market segments. In addition, plant construction and modernization may temporarily disrupt our manufacturing operations and lead to temporary increases in our costs.We have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health.We have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 31, 2018, our debt (including capital leases) on a consolidated basis was approximately $5.8 billion. Our substantial amount of debt and other obligations could have important consequences. For example, it could:•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;•impair our ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, acquisitions or general corporate requirements;•increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;•limit our ability to use cash flows from operating activities in other areas of our business or to return cash to shareholders because we would need to dedicate a substantial portion of these funds for payments on our indebtedness;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.The agreements governing our debt, including our credit agreements, limit, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional debt and we may incur a significant amount of additional debt in the future, including additional secured debt. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, our ability to satisfy our debt obligations may become more limited. 12Table of ContentsOur ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt and other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to our ability to implement our strategic initiatives, prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we may be forced to reduce or eliminate our share repurchase program and the dividend on our common stock, reduce or delay expansion plans and capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that our operating performance, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient to pay our debt obligations when they become due. We cannot assure you that we would be able to dispose of material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt or other obligations if necessary or, even if we were able to take such actions, that we could do so on terms that are acceptable to us.Any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our debt instruments, or a material reduction in the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations.The agreements governing our secured credit facilities, senior unsecured notes and our other outstanding indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things:•incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock;•pay dividends, repurchase shares or make certain other restricted payments or investments;•incur liens;•sell assets;•incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us;•enter into affiliate transactions;•engage in sale/leaseback transactions; and•engage in certain mergers or consolidations or transfers of substantially all of our assets.Availability under our first lien revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory, the value of our principal trademarks, and certain cash in an amount not to exceed $200 million. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and inventory and other components of the borrowing base decline in value, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under that facility may decrease below its stated amount. In addition, if at any time the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under that facility exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to prepay borrowings and/or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess.Our ability to comply with these covenants or to maintain our borrowing base may be affected by events beyond our control, including deteriorating economic conditions, and these events could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures. We cannot assure you that such waivers, amendments or alternative financing could be obtained, or if obtained, would be on terms acceptable to us.A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in any of our existing or future financing agreements, including the financial covenants in our secured credit facilities, could result in an event of default under those agreements. Such a default could allow the lenders under our financing agreements, if the agreements so provide, to discontinue lending, to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, and/or to declare all borrowings outstanding thereunder to be due and payable. In addition, the lenders could terminate any commitments they have to provide us with further funds. If any of these events occur, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available to pay in full the total amount of obligations that become due as a result of any such acceleration, or that we will be able to find additional or alternative financing to refinance any such accelerated obligations. Even if we obtain additional or alternative financing, we cannot assure you that it would be on terms that would be acceptable to us.We cannot assure you that we will be able to remain in compliance with the covenants to which we are subject in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from our lenders or amend the covenants. 13Table of ContentsOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.Certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, which would require us to use more of our available cash to service our indebtedness. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to enter into swap agreements or other hedging arrangements in the future if we desire to do so, or that any existing or future hedging arrangements will offset increases in interest rates. As of December 31, 2018, we had $1,887 million of variable rate debt outstanding.We have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales.We operate with significant operating and financial leverage. Significant portions of our manufacturing, selling, administrative and general expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with sales. In addition, a significant portion of our interest expense is fixed. There can be no assurance that we would be able to reduce our fixed costs proportionately in response to a decline in our net sales and therefore our competitiveness could be significantly impacted. As a result, a decline in our net sales could result in a higher percentage decline in our income from operations and net income.We may incur significant costs in connection with our contingent liabilities and tax matters.We have significant reserves for contingent liabilities and tax matters.  The major categories of our contingent liabilities include workers' compensation and other employment-related claims, product liability and other tort claims, including asbestos claims, and environmental matters.  Our recorded liabilities and estimates of reasonably possible losses for our contingent liabilities are based on our assessment of potential liability using the information available to us at the time and, where applicable, any past experience and recent and current trends with respect to similar matters. Our contingent liabilities are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable judicial or administrative decisions could occur that we did not anticipate.  Such an unfavorable decision could include monetary damages, fines or other penalties or an injunction prohibiting us from taking certain actions or selling certain products.  If such an unfavorable decision were to occur, it could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations in the period in which the decision occurs, or in future periods.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations, including with respect to transfer pricing.  While we apply consistent transfer pricing policies and practices globally, support transfer prices through economic studies, seek advance pricing agreements and joint audits to the extent possible and believe our transfer prices to be appropriate, such transfer prices, and related interpretations of tax laws, are occasionally challenged by various taxing authorities globally.  We have received various tax assessments challenging our interpretations of applicable tax laws in various jurisdictions.  Although we believe we have complied with applicable tax laws, have strong positions and defenses and have historically been successful in defending such claims, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in the case we are unsuccessful in the defense of existing or future claims. If we wish to appeal any future adverse judgment in any of these proceedings, we may be required to post an appeal bond with the relevant court.   If we were subject to a significant adverse judgment or experienced an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity, we may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.We have significant deferred tax assets, including foreign tax credits.  We must generate sufficient earnings of the appropriate character in order to utilize our deferred tax assets prior to any applicable expiration dates.  If our earnings remain flat or decline over an extended period of time, we may not be able to utilize certain of our deferred tax assets prior to their expiration and we may need to record a valuation allowance against them that could materially adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which the valuation allowance is recorded.For further information regarding our contingent liabilities and tax matters, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements, No. 19, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.  For further information regarding our accounting policies with respect to certain of our contingent liabilities and uncertain income tax positions, refer to “Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies.”We are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating results.We are subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, which has established various standards and regulations applicable to tires sold in the United States and tires sold in a foreign country that are identical or substantially similar to tires sold in the United States. NHTSA has the authority to order the recall of automotive products, including tires, having safety-related defects or that do not comply with a motor vehicle safety standard. 14Table of ContentsThe Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation Act, or TREAD Act, imposes numerous requirements with respect to the early warning reporting of warranty claims, property damage claims, and bodily injury and fatality claims and also requires tire manufacturers, among other things, to comply with revised and more rigorous tire testing standards. Compliance with the TREAD Act regulations has increased the cost of producing and distributing tires in the United States. In addition, while we believe that our tires are free from design and manufacturing defects, it is possible that a recall of our tires, including under the TREAD Act or in other countries under similar regulations, could occur in the future. A substantial recall could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and financial condition.In addition, as required by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, NHTSA will establish a national tire fuel efficiency consumer information program. When the related rule-making process is completed, certain tires sold in the United States will be required to be rated for rolling resistance, traction and tread wear. While the federal law will preempt state tire fuel efficiency laws adopted after January 1, 2006, we may become subject to additional tire fuel efficiency legislation, either in the United States or other countries.Our European operations are subject to regulation by the European Union. In 2009, two regulations, the Tire Safety Regulation and the Tire Labeling Regulation, applicable to tires sold in the European Union were adopted. The Tire Safety Regulation sets performance standards that tires for cars and light and commercial trucks need to meet for rolling resistance, wet grip braking (passenger car tires only) and noise in order to be sold in the European Union, and became effective beginning in 2012, with continuing phases that will become effective through 2020. The Tire Labeling Regulation applies to all passenger car, light truck and commercial truck tires and requires that consumers be informed about the tire's fuel efficiency, wet grip and noise characteristics. Other countries, such as Brazil, have also adopted tire labeling regulations, and additional countries may also introduce similar regulations in the future.Tires produced or sold in Europe also have to comply with various other standards, including environmental laws such as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemical Substances), which regulates the use of chemicals in the European Union. For example, REACH prohibits the use of highly aromatic oils in tires, which were used as compounding components to improve certain performance characteristics.These U.S. and European regulations, rules adopted to implement these regulations, or other similar regulations that may be adopted in the United States, Europe or elsewhere in the future may require us to alter or increase our capital spending and research and development plans or cease the production of certain tires, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Laws and regulations governing environmental and occupational safety and health are complicated, change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time. As a manufacturing company, we are subject to these laws and regulations both inside and outside the United States. We may not be in complete compliance with such laws and regulations at all times. Our costs or liabilities relating to them may be more than the amount we have reserved, and that difference may be material.In addition, our manufacturing facilities may become subject to further limitations on the emission of “greenhouse gases” due to public policy concerns regarding climate change issues or other environmental or health and safety concerns. While the form of any additional regulations cannot be predicted, a “cap-and-trade” system similar to the one adopted in the European Union could be adopted in the United States. Any such “cap-and-trade” system (including the system currently in place in the European Union) or other limitations imposed on the emission of “greenhouse gases” could require us to increase our capital expenditures, use our cash to acquire emission credits or restructure our manufacturing operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.Compliance with the laws and regulations described above or any of the myriad of applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations currently in effect or that may be adopted in the future could materially adversely affect our competitive position, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We may be adversely affected by any disruption in, or failure of, our information technology systems.We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology, or IT, systems across all of our major business functions, including our research and development, manufacturing, retail, financial and administrative functions.  We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing upgrades when necessary.  Our security measures are focused on the prevention, detection and remediation of damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, cyber-attack, natural disasters and other similar disruptions.  We may incur significant costs in order to implement the security measures that we feel are necessary to protect our IT systems. However, our IT systems may remain vulnerable to damage despite our implementation of security measures that we deem to be appropriate.Any system failure, accident or security breach involving our IT systems could result in disruptions to our operations.  A breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets, negatively impact our manufacturing or retail operations, or result in the compromise of personal information of our employees, customers or suppliers. While we have, from time to time, experienced system failures, accidents and security breaches involving our IT systems, these incidents have not had a material impact on our operations, and we are not aware of any resulting theft, loss or disclosure of, or  15Table of Contentsdamage to, material data or confidential information. To the extent that any system failure, accident or security breach results in material disruptions to our operations or the theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, material data or confidential information, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially adversely affected.Our business substantially depends on the continued service of key members of our management. The loss of the services of a significant number of members of our management could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, such as engineering, marketing and senior management professionals. Competition for these employees is intense, and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting new high quality employees, our business could be materially adversely affected.We may be impacted by economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters.We manage businesses and facilities worldwide. Our facilities and operations, and the facilities and operations of our suppliers and customers, could be disrupted by events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters. Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales and customers. We may not be insured against all such potential losses and, if insured, the insurance proceeds that we receive may not adequately compensate us for all of our losses"
1,GT,GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER CO,2018-02-08,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when considering an investment decision with respect to our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If they do, our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be materially adversely affected. In such an instance, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment.If we do not successfully implement our strategic initiatives, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.We experienced challenging global industry conditions in 2017, and our business was impacted by trends that negatively affected the tire industry in general.  These negative trends include higher raw material costs, increased competition and weak demand in many of our key markets despite favorable trends in miles driven, gasoline prices and unemployment.  Global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict.  If these overall trends continue or worsen, then our operational and financial condition could be adversely affected.In order to offset the impact of these trends, we are pursuing important strategic initiatives, such as our operational excellence, sales and marketing excellence and innovation excellence initiatives. We are also undertaking significant capital investments in building, expanding and modernizing manufacturing facilities around the world, including a new manufacturing facility in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. The failure to implement successfully our important strategic initiatives may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.Our operational excellence initiatives are aimed at improving our manufacturing efficiency and creating an advantaged supply chain focused on reducing our total delivered costs, optimizing working capital levels and delivering best in industry customer service. Our sales and marketing excellence initiatives are intended to build the value of our brand, help our customers win in their markets, and become consumers' preferred choice.  Our innovation excellence initiatives are designed to develop great products and services that anticipate and respond to the needs of consumers. If we fail to execute these initiatives successfully, we may fail to achieve our financial goals.Our performance is also dependent on our ability to improve the volume and mix of higher margin tires we sell in our targeted market segments. In order to do so, we must be successful in developing, producing, marketing and selling products that consumers' desire and that offer higher margins to us. Shifts in consumer demand away from higher margin tires could materially adversely affect our business. We have been capacity constrained from time to time with respect to the production of certain higher margin tires, particularly in the United States and Western Europe. We plan to alleviate these constraints by utilizing our global manufacturing footprint to meet the demand for our tires and by adding manufacturing capacity to produce approximately 20 million tires at our manufacturing facilities worldwide. However, in spite of these initiatives, we may not be able to meet all of the demand for certain of our higher margin tires, which could harm our competitive position and limit our growth. We cannot assure you that our strategic initiatives will be successful. If not, we may not be able to achieve or sustain future profitability, which would impair our ability to meet our debt and other obligations and would otherwise negatively affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We face significant global competition and our market share could decline.New tires are sold under highly competitive conditions throughout the world. We compete with other tire manufacturers on the basis of product design, performance, price and terms, reputation, warranty terms, customer service and consumer convenience. On a worldwide basis, we have two major competitors, Bridgestone (based in Japan) and Michelin (based in France), that have large shares of the markets of the countries in which they are based and are aggressively seeking to maintain or improve their worldwide market share. Other significant competitors include Continental, Cooper, Hankook, Kumho, Pirelli, Sumitomo, Toyo, Yokohama and various regional tire manufacturers. Our competitors produce significant numbers of tires in low-cost countries, and have announced plans to further increase their production capacity in those countries as well as the United States.  These increases in production capacity may result in even greater competition in the United States and elsewhere.Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in significant part, on our ability to continue to innovate and manufacture the types of tires demanded by consumers, and to reduce costs by such means as reducing excess and high-cost capacity, leveraging global purchasing, improving productivity, eliminating redundancies and increasing production at low-cost supply sources. If we are unable to compete successfully, our market share may decline, materially adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the automotive industry may experience significant changes due to the introduction of new technologies, such as electric and autonomous vehicles, or new services, business models or methods of travel, such as ride sharing.  As the automotive industry evolves, we may need to provide a wider range of products and services to remain competitive, including products that we do not currently have the capability to manufacture or services that we do not currently offer. The demand for our products  9Table of Contentsmay also decline if automotive production declines and/or total vehicle miles traveled declines.  If we do not accurately predict, prepare for and respond to market developments, technological innovations and changing customer and consumer needs, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Raw material and energy costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Raw material costs have historically been volatile, and we may experience increases in the prices of natural and synthetic rubber, carbon black and petrochemical-based commodities. Market conditions, including actions by competitors, or contractual obligations may prevent us from passing any such increased costs on to our customers through timely price increases. Additionally, higher raw material and energy costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. As a result, higher raw material and energy costs could result in declining margins and operating results and adversely affect our financial condition. The volatility of raw material costs may cause our margins, operating results and liquidity to fluctuate. In addition, lower raw material costs may put downward pressure on the price of tires, which could ultimately reduce our margins and adversely affect our results of operations.If we fail to extend or renegotiate significant collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions as they expire from time to time, or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.We are a party to collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions, which represent a significant number of our employees. Our master collective bargaining agreement with the USW covers approximately 7,000 employees in the United States at December 31, 2017, and expires in July 2022. In addition, approximately 25,000 of our employees outside of the United States are covered by union contracts that have expired or are expiring in 2018, primarily in Germany, Brazil, Poland, Luxembourg and China. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory, no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time to time. If we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements, if disputes with our unions arise, or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, we could experience a significant disruption of, or inefficiencies in, our operations or incur higher labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We could be negatively impacted by the imposition of tariffs on imported tires. The imposition of tariffs on certain tires imported from China or other countries may reduce our flexibility to utilize our global manufacturing footprint to meet demand for our tires around the world. In addition, the imposition of tariffs in the United States may result in the tires subject to such tariffs being diverted to other regions of the world, such as Europe, Latin America or Asia, or in retaliatory tariffs or other actions by affected countries, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We have manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the world. Our international operations are subject to certain inherent risks, including:•exposure to local economic conditions;•adverse foreign currency fluctuations;•adverse currency exchange controls;•withholding taxes and restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings; •tax policies and regulations;•labor regulations;•tariffs;•government price and profit margin controls;•expropriations of property;•adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States;•the potential instability of foreign governments;•hostility from local populations and insurrections;•risks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities; 10Table of Contents•export and import restrictions; and•other changes in laws or government policies.The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable. Certain regions, including Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, are inherently more economically and politically volatile and as a result, our business units that operate in these regions could be subject to significant fluctuations in sales and operating income from quarter to quarter. Because a significant percentage of our operating income in recent years has come from these regions, adverse fluctuations in the operating results in these regions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in future periods.For example, since 2003, Venezuela has imposed currency exchange controls that establish the exchange rate between the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte and the U.S. dollar and restrict the ability to exchange bolivares fuertes for dollars. These restrictions have delayed and limited our ability to pay third-party and affiliated suppliers and to otherwise repatriate funds from Venezuela. In addition, other government regulations, such as price and profit margin controls and strict labor laws, have limited our ability to make and execute operational decisions at our Venezuelan subsidiary.  The lack of currency exchangeability, combined with these other operating restrictions, have significantly limited our Venezuelan subsidiary’s ability to maintain normal production and control over its operations.  As a result, we deconsolidated the operations of our Venezuelan subsidiary and began reporting its results using the cost method of accounting effective December 31, 2015.In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions.  These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export laws, anti-competition laws, anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, data privacy requirements, tax laws, and accounting, internal control and disclosure requirements.  Violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations.  In certain foreign jurisdictions, there is a higher risk of fraud or corruption and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls and compliance programs.  Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws and regulations.We have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.The financial position and results of operations of many of our international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on our reported sales and operating margin (and conversely, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies has a positive impact). For the year ended December 31, 2017, foreign currency translation favorably affected sales by $178 million and favorably affected segment operating income by $10 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The volatility of currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results.Our long term ability to meet our obligations, to repay maturing indebtedness or to implement strategic initiatives may be dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results.The adequacy of our liquidity depends on our ability to achieve an appropriate combination of operating improvements, financing from third parties and access to capital markets. We may need to undertake additional financing actions in the capital markets in order to ensure that our future liquidity requirements are addressed or to implement strategic initiatives. These actions may include the issuance of additional debt or equity, or the factoring of our accounts receivable.Our access to the capital markets cannot be assured and is dependent on, among other things, the ability and willingness of financial institutions to extend credit on terms that are acceptable to us or our suppliers, or to honor future draws on our existing lines of credit, and the degree of success we have in implementing our strategic initiatives. Over the past several years, we have increased our use of supplier financing programs and the factoring of our accounts receivable in order to improve our working capital efficiency and reduce our costs. If these programs become unavailable or less attractive to us or our suppliers, our liquidity could be adversely affected.Future liquidity requirements, or our inability to access cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit, also may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. A substantial portion of our assets is subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness. 11Table of ContentsOur inability to access the capital markets or incur additional debt in the future could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations, and could require us to consider further measures, including deferring planned capital expenditures, reducing discretionary spending, selling additional assets and restructuring existing debt.Financial difficulties, work stoppages, supply disruptions or economic conditions affecting our major customers, dealers or suppliers could harm our business.We experienced challenging global industry conditions in 2017, particularly in Americas and EMEA. As a result of these industry conditions, automotive vehicle production and global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict.Although sales to our OE customers accounted for approximately 20% of our net sales in 2017, demand for our products by OE customers and production levels at our facilities are impacted by automotive vehicle production. We may experience future declines in sales volume due to declines in new vehicle sales, the discontinuation or sale of certain OE brands, platforms or programs, increased competition, or weakness in the demand for replacement tires, which could result in us incurring under-absorbed fixed costs at our production facilities or slowing the rate at which we are able to recover those costs.Automotive production can also be affected by labor relation issues, financial difficulties or supply disruptions. Our OE customers could experience production disruptions resulting from their own or supplier labor, financial or supply difficulties. Such events may cause an OE customer to reduce or suspend vehicle production. As a result, an OE customer could halt or significantly reduce purchases of our products, which would harm our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.In addition, the bankruptcy, restructuring or consolidation of one or more of our major customers, dealers or suppliers could result in the write-off of accounts receivable, a reduction in purchases of our products or a supply disruption to our facilities, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost-effective manner.Our capital expenditures are limited by our liquidity and capital resources and the amount we have available for capital spending is limited by the need to pay our other expenses and to maintain adequate cash reserves and borrowing capacity to meet unexpected demands that may arise. We believe that our ratio of capital expenditures to sales is lower than the comparable ratio for our principal competitors.Productivity improvements and manufacturing cost improvements may be required to offset potential increases in labor and raw material costs and competitive price pressures. In addition, as part of our strategy to reduce high-cost and excess manufacturing capacity and to increase our capacity to produce higher margin tires, we may need to modernize or expand our facilities.  We are currently undertaking significant construction, expansion and modernization projects in the United States, China, India, Luxembourg and Mexico.We may not have sufficient resources to implement planned capital expenditures with minimal disruption to our existing manufacturing operations, or within desired time frames and budgets. Any disruption to our operations, delay in implementing capital improvements or unexpected costs may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.If we are unable to make sufficient capital expenditures, or to maximize the efficiency of the capital expenditures we do make, we may be unable to achieve productivity improvements, which may harm our competitive position, or to manufacture the products necessary to compete successfully in our targeted market segments. In addition, plant construction and modernization may temporarily disrupt our manufacturing operations and lead to temporary increases in our costs.We have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health.We have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 31, 2017, our debt (including capital leases) on a consolidated basis was approximately $5.7 billion. Our substantial amount of debt and other obligations could have important consequences. For example, it could:•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;•impair our ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, acquisitions or general corporate requirements;•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•limit our ability to use cash flows from operating activities in other areas of our business or to return cash to shareholders because we would need to dedicate a substantial portion of these funds for payments on our indebtedness;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors. 12Table of ContentsThe agreements governing our debt, including our credit agreements, limit, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional debt and we may incur a significant amount of additional debt in the future, including additional secured debt. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, our ability to satisfy our debt obligations may become more limited.Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt and other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to our ability to implement our strategic initiatives, prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we may be forced to reduce or eliminate our share repurchase program and the dividend on our common stock, reduce or delay expansion plans and capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that our operating performance, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient to pay our debt obligations when they become due. We cannot assure you that we would be able to dispose of material assets or operations or restructure our debt or other obligations if necessary or, even if we were able to take such actions, that we could do so on terms that are acceptable to us.Any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our debt instruments, or a material reduction in the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations.The agreements governing our secured credit facilities, senior unsecured notes and our other outstanding indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things:•incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock;•pay dividends, repurchase shares or make certain other restricted payments or investments;•incur liens;•sell assets;•incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us;•enter into affiliate transactions;•engage in sale/leaseback transactions; and•engage in certain mergers or consolidations or transfers of substantially all of our assets.Availability under our first lien revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory, the value of our principal trademarks, and certain cash in an amount not to exceed $200 million. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and inventory and other components of the borrowing base decline in value, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under that facility may decrease below its stated amount. In addition, if at any time the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under that facility exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to prepay borrowings and/or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess.Our ability to comply with these covenants or to maintain our borrowing base may be affected by events beyond our control, including deteriorating economic conditions, and these events could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures. We cannot assure you that such waivers, amendments or alternative financing could be obtained, or if obtained, would be on terms acceptable to us.A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in any of our existing or future financing agreements, including the financial covenants in our secured credit facilities, could result in an event of default under those agreements. Such a default could allow the lenders under our financing agreements, if the agreements so provide, to discontinue lending, to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, and/or to declare all borrowings outstanding thereunder to be due and payable. In addition, the lenders could terminate any commitments they have to provide us with further funds. If any of these events occur, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available to pay in full the total amount of obligations that become due as a result of any such acceleration, or that we will be able to find additional or alternative financing to refinance any such accelerated obligations. Even if we obtain additional or alternative financing, we cannot assure you that it would be on terms that would be acceptable to us.We cannot assure you that we will be able to remain in compliance with the covenants to which we are subject in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from our lenders or amend the covenants. 13Table of ContentsOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.Certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, which would require us to use more of our available cash to service our indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into swap agreements or other hedging arrangements in the future, or that existing or future hedging arrangements will offset increases in interest rates. As of December 31, 2017, we had $1,963 million of variable rate debt outstanding.We have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales.We operate with significant operating and financial leverage. Significant portions of our manufacturing, selling, administrative and general expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with sales. In addition, a significant portion of our interest expense is fixed. There can be no assurance that we would be able to reduce our fixed costs proportionately in response to a decline in our net sales and therefore our competitiveness could be significantly impacted. As a result, a decline in our net sales could result in a higher percentage decline in our income from operations and net income.We may incur significant costs in connection with our contingent liabilities and tax matters.We have significant reserves for contingent liabilities and tax matters.  The major categories of our contingent liabilities include workers' compensation and other employment-related claims, product liability and other tort claims, including asbestos claims, and environmental matters.  Our recorded liabilities and estimates of reasonably possible losses for our contingent liabilities are based on our assessment of potential liability using the information available to us at the time and, where applicable, any past experience and recent and current trends with respect to similar matters. Our contingent liabilities are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable judicial or administrative decisions could occur that we did not anticipate.  Such an unfavorable decision could include monetary damages, fines or other penalties or an injunction prohibiting us from taking certain actions or selling certain products.  If such an unfavorable decision were to occur, it could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations in the period in which the decision occurs, or in future periods.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations, including with respect to transfer pricing.  While we apply consistent transfer pricing policies and practices globally, support transfer prices through economic studies, seek advance pricing agreements and joint audits to the extent possible and believe our transfer prices to be appropriate, such transfer prices, and related interpretations of tax laws, are occasionally challenged by various taxing authorities globally.  We have received various tax assessments challenging our interpretations of applicable tax laws in various jurisdictions.  Although we believe we have complied with applicable tax laws, have strong positions and defenses and have historically been successful in defending such claims, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in the case we are unsuccessful in the defense of existing or future claims. If we wish to appeal any future adverse judgment in any of these proceedings, we may be required to post an appeal bond with the relevant court.   If we were subject to a significant adverse judgment or experienced an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity, we may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.For further information regarding our contingent liabilities and tax matters, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements, No. 19, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.  For further information regarding our accounting policies with respect to certain of our contingent liabilities and uncertain income tax positions, refer to “Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies.”We are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating results.We are subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, which has established various standards and regulations applicable to tires sold in the United States and tires sold in a foreign country that are identical or substantially similar to tires sold in the United States. NHTSA has the authority to order the recall of automotive products, including tires, having safety-related defects or that do not comply with a motor vehicle safety standard.The Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation Act, or TREAD Act, imposes numerous requirements with respect to the early warning reporting of warranty claims, property damage claims, and bodily injury and fatality claims and also requires tire manufacturers, among other things, to comply with revised and more rigorous tire testing standards. Compliance with the TREAD Act regulations has increased the cost of producing and distributing tires in the United States. In addition, while we believe that our tires are free from design and manufacturing defects, it is possible that a recall of our tires, including under the TREAD Act or in other countries under similar regulations, could occur in the future. A substantial recall could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and financial condition. 14Table of ContentsIn addition, as required by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, NHTSA will establish a national tire fuel efficiency consumer information program. When the related rule-making process is completed, certain tires sold in the United States will be required to be rated for rolling resistance, traction and tread wear. While the Federal law will preempt state tire fuel efficiency laws adopted after January 1, 2006, we may become subject to additional tire fuel efficiency legislation, either in the United States or other countries.Our European operations are subject to regulation by the European Union. In 2009, two regulations, the Tire Safety Regulation and the Tire Labeling Regulation, applicable to tires sold in the European Union were adopted. The Tire Safety Regulation sets performance standards that tires for cars and light and commercial trucks need to meet for rolling resistance, wet grip braking (passenger car tires only) and noise in order to be sold in the European Union, and became effective beginning in 2012, with continuing phases that will become effective through 2020. The Tire Labeling Regulation applies to all passenger car, light truck and commercial truck tires and requires that consumers be informed about the tire's fuel efficiency, wet grip and noise characteristics. Other countries, such as Brazil, have also adopted tire labeling regulations, and additional countries may also introduce similar regulations in the future.Tires produced or sold in Europe also have to comply with various other standards, including environmental laws such as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemical Substances), which regulates the use of chemicals in the European Union. For example, REACH prohibits the use of highly aromatic oils in tires, which were used as compounding components to improve certain performance characteristics.These U.S. and European regulations, rules adopted to implement these regulations, or other similar regulations that may be adopted in the United States, Europe or elsewhere in the future may require us to alter or increase our capital spending and research and development plans or cease the production of certain tires, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Laws and regulations governing environmental and occupational safety and health are complicated, change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time. As a manufacturing company, we are subject to these laws and regulations both inside and outside the United States. We may not be in complete compliance with such laws and regulations at all times. Our costs or liabilities relating to them may be more than the amount we have reserved, and that difference may be material.In addition, our manufacturing facilities may become subject to further limitations on the emission of “greenhouse gases” due to public policy concerns regarding climate change issues or other environmental or health and safety concerns. While the form of any additional regulations cannot be predicted, a “cap-and-trade” system similar to the one adopted in the European Union could be adopted in the United States. Any such “cap-and-trade” system (including the system currently in place in the European Union) or other limitations imposed on the emission of “greenhouse gases” could require us to increase our capital expenditures, use our cash to acquire emission credits or restructure our manufacturing operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.Compliance with the laws and regulations described above or any of the myriad of applicable foreign, Federal, state and local laws and regulations currently in effect or that may be adopted in the future could materially adversely affect our competitive position, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We may be adversely affected by any disruption in, or failure of, our information technology systems.We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology, or IT, systems across all of our major business functions, including our research and development, manufacturing, retail, financial and administrative functions.  We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing upgrades when necessary.  Our security measures are focused on the prevention, detection and remediation of damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, cyber-attack, natural disasters and other similar disruptions.  We may incur significant costs in order to implement the security measures that we feel are necessary to protect our IT systems. However, our IT systems may remain vulnerable to damage despite our implementation of security measures that we deem to be appropriate.Any system failure, accident or security breach involving our IT systems could result in disruptions to our operations.  A breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets, negatively impact our manufacturing or retail operations, or result in the compromise of personal information of our employees, customers or suppliers. While we have, from time to time, experienced system failures, accidents and security breaches involving our IT systems, these incidents have not had a material impact on our operations, and we are not aware of any resulting theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, material data or confidential information. To the extent that any system failure, accident or security breach results in material disruptions to our operations or the theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, material data or confidential information, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 15Table of ContentsIf we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially adversely affected.Our business substantially depends on the continued service of key members of our management. The loss of the services of a significant number of members of our management could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, such as engineering, marketing and senior management professionals. Competition for these employees is intense, and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting new high quality employees, our business could be materially adversely affected.We may be impacted by economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters.We manage businesses and facilities worldwide. Our facilities and operations, and the facilities and operations of our suppliers and customers, could be disrupted by events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters. Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales and customers. We may not be insured against all such potential losses and, if insured, the insurance proceeds that we receive may not adequately compensate us for all of our losses"
13,GT,GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER CO,2017-02-08,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when considering an investment decision with respect to our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If they do, our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be materially adversely affected. In such an instance, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment.If we do not successfully implement our strategic initiatives, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.Volatile global industry conditions continued in 2016, and our business was impacted by trends that negatively affected the tire industry in general. These negative trends include mixed industry conditions in Americas, where we experienced weakening demand for commercial truck tires in the United States and continuing recessionary economic conditions in Brazil, and increased competition, particularly with respect to smaller rim diameter consumer tires, in EMEA. Global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict. In addition, we were also impacted by the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most foreign currencies. If these overall trends continue or worsen, then our operational and financial condition could be adversely affected.In order to offset the impact of these trends, we have announced important strategic initiatives, such as our operational excellence, sales and marketing excellence and innovation excellence initiatives. We are also undertaking significant capital investments in building, expanding and modernizing manufacturing facilities around the world, including a new manufacturing facility in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. The failure to implement successfully our important strategic initiatives may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.Our operational excellence initiatives are aimed at improving our manufacturing efficiency and creating an advantaged supply chain focused on reducing our total delivered costs, optimizing working capital levels and delivering best in industry customer service. Our sales and marketing excellence initiatives are intended to build the value of our brand, help our customers win in their markets, and become consumers' preferred choice.  Our innovation excellence initiatives are designed to develop great products and services that anticipate and respond to the needs of consumers. If we fail to execute these initiatives successfully, we may fail to achieve our financial goals.Our performance is also dependent on our ability to improve the volume and mix of higher margin tires we sell in our targeted market segments. In order to do so, we must be successful in developing, producing, marketing and selling products that consumers' desire and that offer higher margins to us. Shifts in consumer demand away from higher margin tires could materially adversely affect our business. We are currently capacity constrained with respect to the production of certain higher margin tires, particularly in the United States and Western Europe. We plan to alleviate these constraints by utilizing our global manufacturing footprint to meet the demand for our tires and by adding manufacturing capacity to produce approximately 20 million tires at our manufacturing facilities worldwide. However, in spite of these initiatives, we may not be able to meet all of the demand for certain of our higher margin tires, which could harm our competitive position and limit our growth. We cannot assure you that our strategic initiatives will be successful. If not, we may not be able to achieve or sustain future profitability, which would impair our ability to meet our debt and other obligations and would otherwise negatively affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We face significant global competition and our market share could decline.New tires are sold under highly competitive conditions throughout the world. We compete with other tire manufacturers on the basis of product design, performance, price and terms, reputation, warranty terms, customer service and consumer convenience. On a worldwide basis, we have two major competitors, Bridgestone (based in Japan) and Michelin (based in France), that have large shares of the markets of the countries in which they are based and are aggressively seeking to maintain or improve their worldwide market share. Other significant competitors include Continental, Cooper, Hankook, Kumho, Pirelli, SRI, Toyo, Yokohama and various regional tire manufacturers. Our competitors produce significant numbers of tires in low-cost countries, and have announced plans to further increase their production capacity.Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in significant part, on our ability to continue to innovate and manufacture the types of tires demanded by consumers, and to reduce costs by such means as reducing excess and high-cost capacity, leveraging global purchasing, improving productivity, eliminating redundancies and increasing production at low-cost supply sources. If we are unable to compete successfully, our market share may decline, materially adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the automotive industry may experience significant changes due to the introduction of new technologies, such as autonomous vehicles, or new services, business models or methods of travel, such as ride sharing.  As the automotive industry evolves, we may need to provide a wider range of products and services to remain competitive, including services that we do not currently offer, or the demand for our products may decline if automotive production declines and/or total vehicle miles traveled  10Table of Contentsdeclines.  If we do not accurately predict, prepare for and respond to market developments, technological innovations and changing customer and consumer needs, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Raw material and energy costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Raw material costs have historically been volatile, and we may experience increases in the prices of natural and synthetic rubber, carbon black and petrochemical-based commodities. Market conditions or contractual obligations may prevent us from passing any such increased costs on to our customers through timely price increases. Additionally, higher raw material and energy costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. As a result, higher raw material and energy costs could result in declining margins and operating results and adversely affect our financial condition. The volatility of raw material costs may cause our margins, operating results and liquidity to fluctuate. In addition, lower raw material costs may put downward pressure on the price of tires, which could ultimately reduce our margins and adversely affect our results of operations.If we fail to extend or renegotiate our primary collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions as they expire from time to time, or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.We are a party to collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions, which represent a significant number of our employees. Our master collective bargaining agreement with the USW covers approximately 6,800 employees in the United States at December 31, 2016, and expires July 29, 2017. In addition, approximately 16,000 of our employees outside of the United States are covered by union contracts that have expired or are expiring in 2017, primarily in Brazil, Poland, China and France. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory, no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time to time. If we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements, if disputes with our unions arise, or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, we could experience a significant disruption of, or inefficiencies in, our operations or incur higher labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We could be negatively impacted by the imposition of tariffs on imported tires. The imposition of tariffs on certain tires imported from China or other countries may reduce our flexibility to utilize our global manufacturing footprint to meet demand for our tires around the world. In addition, the imposition of tariffs in the United States may result in the tires subject to such tariffs being diverted to other regions of the world, such as Europe, Latin America or Asia, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in those regions.Our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We have manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the world. Our international operations are subject to certain inherent risks, including:•exposure to local economic conditions;•adverse foreign currency fluctuations;•adverse currency exchange controls;•withholding taxes and restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings; •tax policies and regulations;•labor regulations;•tariffs;•government price and profit margin controls;•expropriations of property;•adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States;•the potential instability of foreign governments;•hostility from local populations and insurrections;•risks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities;•export and import restrictions; and•other changes in laws or government policies. 11Table of ContentsThe likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable. Certain regions, including Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, are inherently more economically and politically volatile and as a result, our business units that operate in these regions could be subject to significant fluctuations in sales and operating income from quarter to quarter. Because a significant percentage of our operating income in recent years has come from these regions, adverse fluctuations in the operating results in these regions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in future periods.For example, since 2003, Venezuela has imposed currency exchange controls that establish the exchange rate between the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte and the U.S. dollar and restrict the ability to exchange bolivares fuertes for dollars. These restrictions have delayed and limited our ability to pay third-party and affiliated suppliers and to otherwise repatriate funds from Venezuela. In addition, other government regulations, such as price and profit margin controls and strict labor laws, have limited our ability to make and execute operational decisions at our Venezuelan subsidiary.  The lack of currency exchangeability, combined with these other operating restrictions, have significantly limited our Venezuelan subsidiary’s ability to maintain normal production and control over its operations.  As a result, we deconsolidated the operations of our Venezuelan subsidiary and began reporting its results using the cost method of accounting effective December 31, 2015.In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions.  These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export laws, anti-competition laws, anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, data privacy requirements, tax laws, and accounting, internal control and disclosure requirements.  Violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations.  In certain foreign jurisdictions, there is a higher risk of fraud or corruption and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls and compliance programs.  Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws and regulations.We have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.The financial position and results of operations of many of our international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on our reported sales and operating margin (and conversely, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies has a positive impact). For the year ended December 31, 2016, foreign currency translation unfavorably affected sales by $258 million and unfavorably affected segment operating income by $30 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The volatility of currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results.Our long term ability to meet our obligations, to repay maturing indebtedness or to implement strategic initiatives may be dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results.The adequacy of our liquidity depends on our ability to achieve an appropriate combination of operating improvements, financing from third parties and access to capital markets. We may need to undertake additional financing actions in the capital markets in order to ensure that our future liquidity requirements are addressed or to implement strategic initiatives. These actions may include the issuance of additional debt or equity, or the factoring of our accounts receivable.Our access to the capital markets cannot be assured and is dependent on, among other things, the ability and willingness of financial institutions to extend credit on terms that are acceptable to us or our suppliers, or to honor future draws on our existing lines of credit, and the degree of success we have in implementing our strategic initiatives. Over the past several years, we have increased our use of supplier financing programs and the factoring of our accounts receivable in order to improve our working capital efficiency and reduce our costs. If these programs become unavailable or less attractive to us or our suppliers, our liquidity could be adversely affected.Future liquidity requirements, or our inability to access cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit, also may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. A substantial portion of our assets is subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness.Our inability to access the capital markets or incur additional debt in the future could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations, and could require us to consider further measures, including deferring planned capital expenditures, reducing discretionary spending, selling additional assets and restructuring existing debt. 12Table of ContentsFinancial difficulties, work stoppages, supply disruptions or economic conditions affecting our major OE customers, dealers or suppliers could harm our business.Volatile global industry conditions continued in 2016, particularly in Americas and EMEA. As a result of these industry conditions, automotive vehicle production and global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict.Although sales to our OE customers accounted for approximately 20% of our net sales in 2016, demand for our products by OE customers and production levels at our facilities are impacted by automotive vehicle production. We may experience future declines in sales volume due to declines in new vehicle sales, the discontinuation or sale of certain OE brands, platforms or programs, increased competition, or weakness in the demand for replacement tires, which could result in us incurring under-absorbed fixed costs at our production facilities or slowing the rate at which we are able to recover those costs.Automotive production can also be affected by labor relation issues, financial difficulties or supply disruptions. Our OE customers could experience production disruptions resulting from their own or supplier labor, financial or supply difficulties. Such events may cause an OE customer to reduce or suspend vehicle production. As a result, an OE customer could halt or significantly reduce purchases of our products, which would harm our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.In addition, the bankruptcy, restructuring or consolidation of one or more of our major OE customers, dealers or suppliers could result in the write-off of accounts receivable, a reduction in purchases of our products or a supply disruption to our facilities, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost-effective manner.Our capital expenditures are limited by our liquidity and capital resources and the amount we have available for capital spending is limited by the need to pay our other expenses and to maintain adequate cash reserves and borrowing capacity to meet unexpected demands that may arise. We believe that our ratio of capital expenditures to sales is lower than the comparable ratio for our principal competitors.Productivity improvements and manufacturing cost improvements may be required to offset potential increases in labor and raw material costs and competitive price pressures. In addition, as part of our strategy to reduce high-cost and excess manufacturing capacity and to increase our capacity to produce higher margin tires, we may need to modernize or expand our facilities.  We are currently undertaking significant construction, expansion and modernization projects in the United States, China, India and Mexico.We may not have sufficient resources to implement planned capital expenditures with minimal disruption to our existing manufacturing operations, or within desired time frames and budgets. Any disruption to our operations, delay in implementing capital improvements or unexpected costs may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.If we are unable to make sufficient capital expenditures, or to maximize the efficiency of the capital expenditures we do make, we may be unable to achieve productivity improvements, which may harm our competitive position, or to manufacture the products necessary to compete successfully in our targeted market segments. In addition, plant construction and modernization may temporarily disrupt our manufacturing operations and lead to temporary increases in our costs.We have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health.We have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 31, 2016, our debt (including capital leases) on a consolidated basis was approximately $5.5 billion. Our substantial amount of debt and other obligations could have important consequences. For example, it could:•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;•impair our ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, acquisitions or general corporate requirements;•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•limit our ability to use cash flows from operating activities in other areas of our business or to return cash to shareholders because we would need to dedicate a substantial portion of these funds for payments on our indebtedness;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.The agreements governing our debt, including our credit agreements, limit, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional debt and we may incur a significant amount of additional debt in the future, including additional secured debt. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, our ability to satisfy our debt obligations may become more limited. 13Table of ContentsOur ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt and other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to our ability to implement our strategic initiatives, prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we may be forced to reduce or eliminate our share repurchase program and the dividend on our common stock, reduce or delay expansion plans and capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that our operating performance, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient to pay our debt obligations when they become due. We cannot assure you that we would be able to dispose of material assets or operations or restructure our debt or other obligations if necessary or, even if we were able to take such actions, that we could do so on terms that are acceptable to us.Any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our debt instruments, or a material reduction in the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations.The agreements governing our secured credit facilities, senior unsecured notes and our other outstanding indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things:•incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock;•pay dividends, repurchase shares or make certain other restricted payments or investments;•incur liens;•sell assets;•incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us;•enter into affiliate transactions;•engage in sale/leaseback transactions; and•engage in certain mergers or consolidations or transfers of substantially all of our assets.Availability under our first lien revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory, the value of our principal trademarks, and certain cash in an amount not to exceed $200 million. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and inventory and other components of the borrowing base decline in value, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under that facility may decrease below its stated amount. In addition, if at any time the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under that facility exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to prepay borrowings and/or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess.Our ability to comply with these covenants or to maintain our borrowing base may be affected by events beyond our control, including deteriorating economic conditions, and these events could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures. We cannot assure you that such waivers, amendments or alternative financing could be obtained, or if obtained, would be on terms acceptable to us.A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in any of our existing or future financing agreements, including the financial covenants in our secured credit facilities, could result in an event of default under those agreements. Such a default could allow the lenders under our financing agreements, if the agreements so provide, to discontinue lending, to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, and/or to declare all borrowings outstanding thereunder to be due and payable. In addition, the lenders could terminate any commitments they have to provide us with further funds. If any of these events occur, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available to pay in full the total amount of obligations that become due as a result of any such acceleration, or that we will be able to find additional or alternative financing to refinance any such accelerated obligations. Even if we obtain additional or alternative financing, we cannot assure you that it would be on terms that would be acceptable to us.We cannot assure you that we will be able to remain in compliance with the covenants to which we are subject in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from our lenders or amend the covenants.Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.Certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, which would require us to use more of our available cash to service our indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into swap agreements or other hedging arrangements in the future, or that existing or future hedging arrangements will offset increases in interest rates. As of December 31, 2016, we had $1,679 million of variable rate debt outstanding. 14Table of ContentsWe have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales.We operate with significant operating and financial leverage. Significant portions of our manufacturing, selling, administrative and general expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with sales. In addition, a significant portion of our interest expense is fixed. There can be no assurance that we would be able to reduce our fixed costs proportionately in response to a decline in our net sales and therefore our competitiveness could be significantly impacted. As a result, a decline in our net sales could result in a higher percentage decline in our income from operations and net income.We may incur significant costs in connection with our contingent liabilities and tax matters.We have significant reserves for contingent liabilities and tax matters.  The major categories of our contingent liabilities include workers' compensation and other employment-related claims, product liability and other tort claims, including asbestos claims, and environmental matters.  Our recorded liabilities and estimates of reasonably possible losses for our contingent liabilities are based on our assessment of potential liability using the information available to us at the time and, where applicable, any past experience and recent and current trends with respect to similar matters. Our contingent liabilities are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable judicial or administrative decisions could occur that we did not anticipate.  Such an unfavorable decision could include monetary damages, fines or other penalties or an injunction prohibiting us from taking certain actions or selling certain products.  If such an unfavorable decision were to occur, it could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations in the period in which the decision occurs, or in future periods.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations, including with respect to transfer pricing.  While we apply consistent transfer pricing policies and practices globally, support transfer prices through economic studies, seek advance pricing agreements and joint audits to the extent possible and believe our transfer prices to be appropriate, such transfer prices, and related interpretations of tax laws, are occasionally challenged by various taxing authorities globally.  We have received various tax assessments challenging our interpretations of applicable tax laws in various jurisdictions.  Although we believe we have complied with applicable tax laws, have strong positions and defenses and have historically been successful in defending such claims, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in the case we are unsuccessful in the defense of existing or future claims. If we wish to appeal any future adverse judgment in any of these proceedings, we may be required to post an appeal bond with the relevant court.   If we were subject to a significant adverse judgment or experienced an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity, we may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.For further information regarding our contingent liabilities and tax matters, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements, No. 19, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.  For further information regarding our accounting policies with respect to certain of our contingent liabilities and uncertain income tax positions, refer to “Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies.”We are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating results.We are subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, which has established various standards and regulations applicable to tires sold in the United States and tires sold in a foreign country that are identical or substantially similar to tires sold in the United States. NHTSA has the authority to order the recall of automotive products, including tires, having safety-related defects or that do not comply with a motor vehicle safety standard.The Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation Act, or TREAD Act, imposes numerous requirements with respect to the early warning reporting of warranty claims, property damage claims, and bodily injury and fatality claims and also requires tire manufacturers, among other things, to comply with revised and more rigorous tire testing standards. Compliance with the TREAD Act regulations has increased the cost of producing and distributing tires in the United States. In addition, while we believe that our tires are free from design and manufacturing defects, it is possible that a recall of our tires, including under the TREAD Act or in other countries under similar regulations, could occur in the future. A substantial recall could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and financial condition.In addition, as required by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, NHTSA will establish a national tire fuel efficiency consumer information program. When the related rule-making process is completed, certain tires sold in the United States will be required to be rated for rolling resistance, traction and tread wear. While the Federal law will preempt state tire fuel efficiency laws adopted after January 1, 2006, we may become subject to additional tire fuel efficiency legislation, either in the United States or other countries.Our European operations are subject to regulation by the European Union. In 2009, two regulations, the Tire Safety Regulation and the Tire Labeling Regulation, applicable to tires sold in the European Union were adopted. The Tire Safety Regulation sets  15Table of Contentsperformance standards that tires for cars and light and commercial trucks need to meet for rolling resistance, wet grip braking (passenger car tires only) and noise in order to be sold in the European Union, and became effective beginning in 2012, with continuing phases that will become effective through 2020. The Tire Labeling Regulation applies to all passenger car, light truck and commercial truck tires and requires that consumers be informed about the tire's fuel efficiency, wet grip and noise characteristics. Other countries, such as Brazil, have also adopted tire labeling regulations, and additional countries may also introduce similar regulations in the future.Tires produced or sold in Europe also have to comply with various other standards, including environmental laws such as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemical Substances), which regulates the use of chemicals in the European Union. For example, REACH prohibits the use of highly aromatic oils in tires, which were used as compounding components to improve certain performance characteristics.These U.S. and European regulations, rules adopted to implement these regulations, or other similar regulations that may be adopted in the United States, Europe or elsewhere in the future may require us to alter or increase our capital spending and research and development plans or cease the production of certain tires, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Laws and regulations governing environmental and occupational safety and health are complicated, change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time. As a manufacturing company, we are subject to these laws and regulations both inside and outside the United States. We may not be in complete compliance with such laws and regulations at all times. Our costs or liabilities relating to them may be more than the amount we have reserved, and that difference may be material.In addition, our manufacturing facilities may become subject to further limitations on the emission of “greenhouse gases” due to public policy concerns regarding climate change issues or other environmental or health and safety concerns. While the form of any additional regulations cannot be predicted, a “cap-and-trade” system similar to the one adopted in the European Union could be adopted in the United States. Any such “cap-and-trade” system (including the system currently in place in the European Union) or other limitations imposed on the emission of “greenhouse gases” could require us to increase our capital expenditures, use our cash to acquire emission credits or restructure our manufacturing operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.Compliance with the laws and regulations described above or any of the myriad of applicable foreign, Federal, state and local laws and regulations currently in effect or that may be adopted in the future could materially adversely affect our competitive position, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We may be adversely affected by any disruption in, or failure of, our information technology systems.We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology, or IT, systems across all of our major business functions, including our research and development, manufacturing, retail, financial and administrative functions.  We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing upgrades when necessary.  Our security measures are focused on the prevention, detection and remediation of damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, cyber-attack, natural disasters and other similar disruptions.  We may incur significant costs in order to implement the security measures that we feel are necessary to protect our IT systems. However, our IT systems may remain vulnerable to damage despite our implementation of security measures that we deem to be appropriate.Any system failure, accident or security breach involving our IT systems could result in disruptions to our operations.  A breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets, negatively impact our manufacturing or retail operations, or result in the compromise of personal information of our employees, customers or suppliers. While we have, from time to time, experienced system failures, accidents and security breaches involving our IT systems, these incidents have not had a material impact on our operations, and we are not aware of any resulting theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, material data or confidential information. To the extent that any system failure, accident or security breach results in material disruptions to our operations or the theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, material data or confidential information, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially adversely affected.Our business substantially depends on the continued service of key members of our management. The loss of the services of a significant number of members of our management could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, such as engineering, marketing and senior management professionals. Competition for these employees is intense, and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting new high quality employees, our business could be materially adversely affected. 16Table of ContentsWe may be impacted by economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters.We manage businesses and facilities worldwide. Our facilities and operations, and the facilities and operations of our suppliers and customers, could be disrupted by events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters. Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales and customers. We may not be insured against all such potential losses and, if insured, the insurance proceeds that we receive may not adequately compensate us for all of our losses"
4,GT,GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER CO,2016-02-09,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when considering an investment decision with respect to our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If they do, our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be materially adversely affected. In such an instance, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment.If we do not successfully implement our strategic initiatives, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.Volatile global industry conditions continued in 2015, and our business was impacted by trends that negatively affected the tire industry in general. These negative trends include economic weakness in Europe, recessionary economic conditions and political volatility in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Venezuela, and slowing growth in Asia Pacific.  Global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict.  In addition, we were also impacted by the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most foreign currencies.  If these overall trends continue or worsen, then our operational and financial condition could be adversely affected.  In order to offset the impact of these trends, we have announced important strategic initiatives, such as our operational excellence and sales and marketing excellence initiatives, increasing our low-cost manufacturing capacity, reducing our high-cost manufacturing capacity, increasing sales in emerging markets, and improving the profitability of our EMEA segment. We are also undertaking significant capital investments in building, expanding and modernizing manufacturing facilities around the world, including a new manufacturing facility in San Luis Potosi, Mexico to supply the Americas. The failure to implement successfully our important strategic initiatives may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.Our operational excellence initiatives are aimed at improving our manufacturing efficiency and creating an advantaged supply chain focused on reducing our total delivered costs, optimizing working capital levels and delivering best in industry customer service. Our sales and marketing excellence initiatives are intended to drive sustainable growth through standard processes and innovative solutions delivered to customers and consumers. If we fail to execute these initiatives successfully, we may fail to achieve our financial goals.If economic and political conditions in emerging markets, such as Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, China and India, deteriorate significantly, we may not be able to increase our sales in emerging markets and our operating results, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.Our performance is also dependent on our ability to improve the volume and mix of higher margin tires we sell in our targeted market segments. In order to do so, we must be successful in developing, producing, marketing and selling products that consumers desire and that offer higher margins to us. Shifts in consumer demand away from higher margin tires could materially adversely affect our business. We are currently capacity constrained with respect to the production of certain higher margin tires, particularly in North America.  We plan to alleviate these constraints by utilizing our global manufacturing footprint to meet the demand for our tires and by adding manufacturing capacity in the Americas, such as our new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico.  However, in spite of these initiatives, we may not be able to meet all of the demand for certain of our higher margin tires, which could harm our competitive position and limit our growth.We cannot assure you that our strategic initiatives will be successful. If not, we may not be able to achieve or sustain future profitability, which would impair our ability to meet our debt and other obligations and would otherwise negatively affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We face significant global competition and our market share could decline.New tires are sold under highly competitive conditions throughout the world. We compete with other tire manufacturers on the basis of product design, performance, price and terms, reputation, warranty terms, customer service and consumer convenience. On a worldwide basis, we have two major competitors, Bridgestone (based in Japan) and Michelin (based in France), that have large shares of the markets of the countries in which they are based and are aggressively seeking to maintain or improve their worldwide market share. Other significant competitors include Continental, Cooper, Hankook, Kumho, Pirelli, SRI, Toyo, Yokohama and various regional tire manufacturers. Our competitors produce significant numbers of tires in low-cost countries, and have announced plans to further increase their production capacity.Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in significant part, on our ability to continue to innovate and manufacture the types of tires demanded by consumers, and to reduce costs by such means as reducing excess and high-cost capacity, leveraging global purchasing, improving productivity, eliminating redundancies and increasing production at low-cost supply sources. If we are unable to compete successfully, our market share may decline, materially adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition. 11Table of ContentsWe could be negatively impacted by the decision to impose tariffs on certain tires imported from China.The imposition of tariffs on certain tires imported from China may reduce our flexibility to utilize our global manufacturing footprint to meet demand for our tires around the world. In addition, the imposition of tariffs in the United States may result in the Chinese tires subject to such tariffs being diverted to other regions of the world, such as Europe, Latin America or elsewhere in Asia, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in those regions.Our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We have manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the world. Our international operations are subject to certain inherent risks, including:•exposure to local economic conditions;•adverse foreign currency fluctuations;•adverse currency exchange controls;•withholding taxes and restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings;•labor regulations;•government price and profit margin controls;•expropriations of property;•adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States;•the potential instability of foreign governments;•hostility from local populations and insurrections;•risks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities;•export and import restrictions; and•other changes in laws or government policies.The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable. Certain regions, including Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, are inherently more economically and politically volatile and as a result, our business units that operate in these regions could be subject to significant fluctuations in sales and operating income from quarter to quarter. Because a significant percentage of our operating income in recent years has come from these regions, adverse fluctuations in the operating results in these regions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in future periods.For example, since 2003, Venezuela has imposed currency exchange controls that establish the exchange rate between the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte and the U.S. dollar and restrict the ability to exchange bolivares fuertes for dollars. These restrictions have delayed and limited our ability to pay third-party and affiliated suppliers and to otherwise repatriate funds from Venezuela. In addition, other government regulations, such as price and profit margin controls and strict labor laws, have increasingly limited our ability to make and execute operational decisions at our Venezuelan subsidiary.  The lack of currency exchangeability, combined with these other operating restrictions, have significantly limited our Venezuelan subsidiary’s ability to maintain normal production and control over its operations.  As a result, we deconsolidated the operations of our Venezuelan subsidiary, recognized a pre-tax $646 million charge and began reporting its results using the cost method of accounting effective December 31, 2015.In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions.  These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export laws, anti-competition laws, anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, data privacy requirements, tax laws, and accounting, internal control and disclosure requirements.  Violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations.  In certain foreign jurisdictions, there is a higher risk of fraud or corruption and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls and compliance programs.  Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws and regulations. 12Table of ContentsWe have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.The financial position and results of operations of many of our international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on our reported sales and operating margin (and conversely, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies has a positive impact). For the year ended December 31, 2015, foreign currency translation unfavorably affected sales by $1,563 million and unfavorably affected segment operating income by $145 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The volatility of currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results.If we fail to extend or renegotiate our primary collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions as they expire from time to time, or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.We are a party to collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions, which represent a significant number of our employees. Our master collective bargaining agreement with the USW covers approximately 6,700 employees in the United States at December 31, 2015, and expires July 29, 2017. In addition, approximately 21,000 of our employees outside of the United States are covered by union contracts that have expired or are expiring in 2016, primarily in Germany, Brazil and South Africa. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory, no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time to time. If we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements, if disputes with our unions arise, or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, we could experience a significant disruption of, or inefficiencies in, our operations or incur higher labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our long term ability to meet our obligations, to repay maturing indebtedness or to implement strategic initiatives may be dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results.The adequacy of our liquidity depends on our ability to achieve an appropriate combination of operating improvements, financing from third parties and access to capital markets. We may need to undertake additional financing actions in the capital markets in order to ensure that our future liquidity requirements are addressed or to implement strategic initiatives. These actions may include the issuance of additional debt or equity, or the factoring of our accounts receivable.Our access to the capital markets cannot be assured and is dependent on, among other things, the ability and willingness of financial institutions to extend credit on terms that are acceptable to us or our suppliers, or to honor future draws on our existing lines of credit, and the degree of success we have in implementing our strategic initiatives. Over the past several years, we have increased our use of supplier financing programs and the factoring of our accounts receivable in order to improve our working capital efficiency and reduce our costs. If these programs become unavailable or less attractive to us or our suppliers, our liquidity could be adversely affected.Future liquidity requirements, or our inability to access cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit, also may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. A substantial portion of our assets is subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness.Our inability to access the capital markets or incur additional debt in the future could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations, and could require us to consider further measures, including deferring planned capital expenditures, reducing discretionary spending, selling additional assets and restructuring existing debt.Financial difficulties, work stoppages, supply disruptions or economic conditions affecting our major OE customers, dealers or suppliers could harm our business.Volatile global industry conditions continued in 2015, particularly in EMEA and Latin America. As a result of these industry conditions, automotive vehicle production and global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict.Although sales to our OE customers account for approximately 20% of our net sales, demand for our products by OE customers and production levels at our facilities are impacted by automotive vehicle production. We may experience future declines in sales volume due to declines in new vehicle sales, the discontinuation or sale of certain OE brands, platforms or programs, increased competition, or weakness in the demand for replacement tires, which could result in us incurring under-absorbed fixed costs at our production facilities or slowing the rate at which we are able to recover those costs.Automotive production can also be affected by labor relation issues, financial difficulties or supply disruptions. Our OE customers could experience production disruptions resulting from their own or supplier labor, financial or supply difficulties. Such events may cause an OE customer to reduce or suspend vehicle production. As a result, an OE customer could halt or significantly reduce purchases of our products, which would harm our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 13Table of ContentsIn addition, the bankruptcy, restructuring or consolidation of one or more of our major OE customers, dealers or suppliers could result in the write-off of accounts receivable, a reduction in purchases of our products or a supply disruption to our facilities, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost-effective manner.Our capital expenditures are limited by our liquidity and capital resources and the amount we have available for capital spending is limited by the need to pay our other expenses and to maintain adequate cash reserves and borrowing capacity to meet unexpected demands that may arise. We believe that our ratio of capital expenditures to sales is lower than the comparable ratio for our principal competitors.Productivity improvements and manufacturing cost improvements may be required to offset potential increases in labor and raw material costs and competitive price pressures. In addition, as part of our strategy to increase the percentage of tires that are produced at our lower-cost production facilities and to increase our capacity to produce higher margin tires, we may need to modernize or expand our facilities.  We are currently building a new manufacturing facility in San Luis Potosi, Mexico and are undertaking significant expansion and modernization projects at certain of our manufacturing facilities in the United States, Brazil, Germany and China.We may not have sufficient resources to implement planned capital expenditures with minimal disruption to our existing manufacturing operations, or within desired time frames and budgets. Any disruption to our operations, delay in implementing capital improvements or unexpected costs may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.If we are unable to make sufficient capital expenditures, or to maximize the efficiency of the capital expenditures we do make, we may be unable to achieve productivity improvements, which may harm our competitive position, or to manufacture the products necessary to compete successfully in our targeted market segments. In addition, plant construction and modernization may temporarily disrupt our manufacturing operations and lead to temporary increases in our costs.Raw material and energy costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Raw material costs have historically been volatile, and we may experience increases in the prices of natural and synthetic rubber, carbon black and petrochemical-based commodities. Market conditions or contractual obligations may prevent us from passing any such increased costs on to our customers through timely price increases. Additionally, higher raw material and energy costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. As a result, higher raw material and energy costs could result in declining margins and operating results and adversely affect our financial condition. The volatility of raw material costs may cause our margins, operating results and liquidity to fluctuate. In addition, lower raw material costs may put downward pressure on the price of tires, which could ultimately reduce our margins and adversely affect our results of operations.We have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health.We have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 31, 2015, our debt (including capital leases) on a consolidated basis was approximately $5.8 billion. Our substantial amount of debt and other obligations could have important consequences. For example, it could:•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;•impair our ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, acquisitions or general corporate requirements;•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•limit our ability to use cash flows from operating activities in other areas of our business or to return cash to shareholders because we would need to dedicate a substantial portion of these funds for payments on our indebtedness;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.The agreements governing our debt, including our credit agreements, limit, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional debt and we may incur a significant amount of additional debt in the future, including additional secured debt. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, our ability to satisfy our debt obligations may become more limited.Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt and other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to our ability to implement our strategic initiatives, prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we may be forced to reduce or eliminate our share repurchase program and the dividend on our common stock, reduce or delay expansion plans and capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that our operating performance, cash flow and capital resources will be  14Table of Contentssufficient to pay our debt obligations when they become due. We cannot assure you that we would be able to dispose of material assets or operations or restructure our debt or other obligations if necessary or, even if we were able to take such actions, that we could do so on terms that are acceptable to us.Any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our debt instruments, or a material reduction in the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations.The indentures and other agreements governing our secured credit facilities, senior unsecured notes and our other outstanding indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things:•incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock;•pay dividends, repurchase shares or make certain other restricted payments or investments;•incur liens;•sell assets;•incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us;•enter into affiliate transactions;•engage in sale/leaseback transactions; and•engage in certain mergers or consolidations or transfers of substantially all of our assets.Availability under our first lien revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and inventory decline, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under that facility may decrease below its stated amount. In addition, if at any time the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under that facility exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to prepay borrowings and/or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess.Our ability to comply with these covenants or to maintain our borrowing base may be affected by events beyond our control, including deteriorating economic conditions, and these events could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures. We cannot assure you that such waivers, amendments or alternative financing could be obtained, or if obtained, would be on terms acceptable to us.A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in any of our existing or future financing agreements, including the financial covenants in our secured credit facilities, could result in an event of default under those agreements. Such a default could allow the lenders under our financing agreements, if the agreements so provide, to discontinue lending, to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, and/or to declare all borrowings outstanding thereunder to be due and payable. In addition, the lenders could terminate any commitments they have to provide us with further funds. If any of these events occur, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available to pay in full the total amount of obligations that become due as a result of any such acceleration, or that we will be able to find additional or alternative financing to refinance any such accelerated obligations. Even if we obtain additional or alternative financing, we cannot assure you that it would be on terms that would be acceptable to us.We cannot assure you that we will be able to remain in compliance with the covenants to which we are subject in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from our lenders or amend the covenants.Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.Certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, which would require us to use more of our available cash to service our indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into swap agreements or other hedging arrangements in the future, or that existing or future hedging arrangements will offset increases in interest rates. As of December 31, 2015, we had $1,769 million of variable rate debt outstanding.We have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales.We operate with significant operating and financial leverage. Significant portions of our manufacturing, selling, administrative and general expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with sales. In addition, a significant portion of our interest expense is fixed. There can be no assurance that we would be able to reduce our fixed costs proportionately in response to a decline in our net sales and therefore our competitiveness could be significantly impacted. As a result, a decline in our net sales could result in a higher percentage decline in our income from operations and net income. 15Table of ContentsWe may incur significant costs in connection with our contingent liabilities and tax matters.We have significant reserves for contingent liabilities and tax matters.  The major categories of our contingent liabilities include workers' compensation and other employment-related claims, product liability and other tort claims, including asbestos claims, and environmental matters.  Our recorded liabilities and estimates of reasonably possible losses for our contingent liabilities are based on our assessment of potential liability using the information available to us at the time and, where applicable, any past experience and recent and current trends with respect to similar matters. Our contingent liabilities are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable judicial or administrative decisions could occur that we did not anticipate.  Such an unfavorable decision could include monetary damages, fines or other penalties or an injunction prohibiting us from taking certain actions or selling certain products.  If such an unfavorable decision were to occur, it could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations in the period in which the decision occurs, or in future periods.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations, including with respect to transfer pricing.  While we apply consistent transfer pricing policies and practices globally, support transfer prices through economic studies, seek advance pricing agreements and joint audits to the extent possible and believe our transfer prices to be appropriate, such transfer prices, and related interpretations of tax laws, are occasionally challenged by various taxing authorities globally.  We have received various tax assessments challenging our interpretations of applicable tax laws in various jurisdictions.  Although we believe we have complied with applicable tax laws, have strong positions and defenses and have historically been successful in defending such claims, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in the case we are unsuccessful in the defense of existing or future claims.If we wish to appeal any future adverse judgment in any of these proceedings, we may be required to post an appeal bond with the relevant court.   If we were subject to a significant adverse judgment or experienced an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity, we may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.For further information regarding our contingent liabilities and tax matters, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements, No. 19, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.  For further information regarding our accounting policies with respect to certain of our contingent liabilities and uncertain income tax positions, refer to “Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies.”We are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating results.We are subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, which has established various standards and regulations applicable to tires sold in the United States and tires sold in a foreign country that are identical or substantially similar to tires sold in the United States. NHTSA has the authority to order the recall of automotive products, including tires, having safety-related defects.The Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation Act, or TREAD Act, imposes numerous requirements with respect to the early warning reporting of warranty claims, property damage claims, and bodily injury and fatality claims and also requires tire manufacturers, among other things, to comply with revised and more rigorous tire testing standards. Compliance with the TREAD Act regulations has increased the cost of producing and distributing tires in the United States. In addition, while we believe that our tires are free from design and manufacturing defects, it is possible that a recall of our tires, under the TREAD Act or otherwise, could occur in the future. A substantial recall could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and financial condition.In addition, as required by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, NHTSA will establish a national tire fuel efficiency consumer information program. When the related rule-making process is completed, certain tires sold in the United States will be required to be rated for rolling resistance, traction and tread wear. While the Federal law will preempt state tire fuel efficiency laws adopted after January 1, 2006, we may become subject to additional tire fuel efficiency legislation, either in the United States or other countries.Our European operations are subject to regulation by the European Union. In 2009, two regulations, the Tire Safety Regulation and the Tire Labeling Regulation, applicable to tires sold in the European Union were adopted. The Tire Safety Regulation sets performance standards that tires for cars and light and commercial trucks need to meet for rolling resistance, wet grip braking (passenger car tires only) and noise in order to be sold in the European Union, and became effective beginning in 2012, with continuing phases that will become effective through 2020. The Tire Labeling Regulation applies to all passenger car, light truck and commercial truck tires and requires that consumers be informed about the tire's fuel efficiency, wet grip and noise characteristics. Other countries, such as Brazil, have also adopted tire labeling regulations, and additional countries may also introduce similar regulations in the future.Tires produced or sold in Europe also have to comply with various other standards, including environmental laws such as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemical Substances), which regulates the use of chemicals in the  16Table of ContentsEuropean Union. For example, REACH prohibits the use of highly aromatic oils in tires, which were used as compounding components to improve certain performance characteristics.These U.S. and European regulations, rules adopted to implement these regulations, or other similar regulations that may be adopted in the United States, Europe or elsewhere in the future may require us to alter or increase our capital spending and research and development plans or cease the production of certain tires, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Laws and regulations governing environmental and occupational safety and health are complicated, change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time. As a manufacturing company, we are subject to these laws and regulations both inside and outside the United States. We may not be in complete compliance with such laws and regulations at all times. Our costs or liabilities relating to them may be more than the amount we have reserved, and that difference may be material.In addition, our manufacturing facilities may become subject to further limitations on the emission of “greenhouse gases” due to public policy concerns regarding climate change issues or other environmental or health and safety concerns. While the form of any additional regulations cannot be predicted, a “cap-and-trade” system similar to the one adopted in the European Union could be adopted in the United States. Any such “cap-and-trade” system (including the system currently in place in the European Union) or other limitations imposed on the emission of “greenhouse gases” could require us to increase our capital expenditures, use our cash to acquire emission credits or restructure our manufacturing operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.Compliance with the laws and regulations described above or any of the myriad of applicable foreign, Federal, state and local laws and regulations currently in effect or that may be adopted in the future could materially adversely affect our competitive position, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We may be adversely affected by any disruption in, or failure of, our information technology systems.We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology, or IT, systems across all of our major business functions, including our research and development, manufacturing, retail, financial and administrative functions.  We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing upgrades when necessary.  Our security measures are focused on the prevention, detection and remediation of damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, cyber attack, natural disasters and other similar disruptions.  We may incur significant costs in order to implement the security measures that we feel are necessary to protect our IT systems.  However, our IT systems may remain vulnerable to damage despite our implementation of security measures that we deem to be appropriate.Any system failure, accident or security breach involving our IT systems could result in disruptions to our operations.  A breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets, negatively impact our manufacturing or retail operations, or result in the compromise of personal information of our employees, customers or suppliers. While we have, from time to time, experienced system failures, accidents and security breaches involving our IT systems, these incidents have not had a material impact on our operations, and we are not aware of any resulting theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, material data or confidential information. To the extent that any system failure, accident or security breach results in material disruptions to our operations or the theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, material data or confidential information, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially adversely affected.Our business substantially depends on the continued service of key members of our management. The loss of the services of a significant number of members of our management could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, such as engineering, marketing and senior management professionals. Competition for these employees is intense, and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting new high quality employees, our business could be materially adversely affected.We may be impacted by economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters.We manage businesses and facilities worldwide. Our facilities and operations, and the facilities and operations of our suppliers and customers, could be disrupted by events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters. Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales and customers. We may not be insured against all such potential losses and, if insured, the insurance proceeds that we receive may not adequately compensate us for all of our losses"
3,GT,GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER CO,2015-02-17,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when considering an investment decision with respect to our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If they do, our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be materially adversely affected. In such an instance, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment.If we do not successfully implement our strategic initiatives, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.We experienced volatile global industry conditions in 2014, and our business was impacted by trends that negatively affected the tire industry in general. These negative trends include economic weakness in Europe, economic and political volatility in Latin America and slowing growth in Asia Pacific.  Global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict.  In addition, we were also impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most foreign currencies.  If these overall trends continue or worsen, then our operational and financial condition could be adversely affected.  In order to offset the impact of these trends, we have announced important strategic initiatives, such as our operational excellence and sales and marketing excellence initiatives, increasing our low-cost manufacturing capacity, reducing our high-cost manufacturing capacity, increasing sales in emerging markets, and improving the profitability of our EMEA segment. We are also undertaking significant capital investments in expanding and modernizing manufacturing facilities around the world, including building a new manufacturing facility in the Americas. The failure to implement successfully our important strategic initiatives may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.Our operational excellence initiatives are aimed at improving our manufacturing efficiency and creating an advantaged supply chain focused on reducing our total delivered costs, optimizing working capital levels and delivering best in industry customer service. Our sales and marketing excellence initiatives are intended to drive sustainable growth through standard processes and innovative solutions delivered to customers and consumers. If we fail to execute these initiatives successfully, we may fail to achieve our financial goals.If economic and political conditions in emerging markets, such as Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, China and India, deteriorate significantly, we may not be able to increase our sales in emerging markets and our operating results, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.Our performance is also dependent on our ability to improve the volume and mix of higher margin tires we sell in our targeted market segments. In order to do so, we must be successful in developing, marketing and selling products that consumers desire and that offer higher margins to us. Shifts in consumer demand away from higher margin tires could materially adversely affect our business.We cannot assure you that our strategic initiatives will be successful. If not, we may not be able to achieve or sustain future profitability, which would impair our ability to meet our debt and other obligations and would otherwise negatively affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We face significant global competition and our market share could decline.New tires are sold under highly competitive conditions throughout the world. We compete with other tire manufacturers on the basis of product design, performance, price and terms, reputation, warranty terms, customer service and consumer convenience. On a worldwide basis, we have two major competitors, Bridgestone (based in Japan) and Michelin (based in France), that have large shares of the markets of the countries in which they are based and are aggressively seeking to maintain or improve their worldwide market share. Other significant competitors include Continental, Cooper, Hankook, Kumho, Pirelli, Toyo, Yokohama and various regional tire manufacturers. Our competitors produce significant numbers of tires in low-cost countries, and have announced plans to further increase their production capacity.Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in significant part, on our ability to continue to innovate and manufacture the types of tires demanded by consumers, and to reduce costs by such means as reducing excess and high-cost capacity, leveraging global purchasing, improving productivity, eliminating redundancies and increasing production at low-cost supply sources. If we are unable to compete successfully, our market share may decline, materially adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition. 11Table of ContentsWe could be negatively impacted by the decision regarding whether to impose tariffs on certain tires imported from China in 2015.Our North American consumer replacement sales were negatively impacted in 2014 by customers building inventory of certain tires imported from China in advance of potential tariffs being imposed in 2015.  As a result of these buying patterns, we believe that there is a significant level of inventory of these tires in the sales channel, which could continue to negatively impact North American consumer replacement sales until a final decision is made regarding the tariffs and that inventory is sold. If the tariffs are ultimately not imposed, sales of this excess inventory to consumers could occur at significantly discounted prices.  Any such sales could, in turn, have a negative impact on our product sales and pricing, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The imposition of such tariffs may also reduce our flexibility to utilize our global manufacturing footprint to meet demand for our tires around the world. In addition, the imposition of tariffs in the United States may result in the Chinese tires subject to such tariffs being diverted to other regions of the world, such as Europe, Latin America or elsewhere in Asia, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in those regions.Our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We have manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the world. Our international operations are subject to certain inherent risks, including:•exposure to local economic conditions;•adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States;•hostility from local populations and insurrections;•adverse foreign currency fluctuations;•adverse currency exchange controls;•government price and profit margin controls;•withholding taxes and restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings;•labor regulations;•expropriations of property;•the potential instability of foreign governments;•risks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities;•export and import restrictions; and•other changes in laws or government policies.The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable. Certain regions, including Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, are inherently more economically and politically volatile and as a result, our business units that operate in these regions could be subject to significant fluctuations in sales and operating income from quarter to quarter. Because a significant percentage of our operating income in recent years has come from these regions, adverse fluctuations in the operating results in these regions could have a disproportionate impact on our results of operations in future periods.For example, since 2003, Venezuela has imposed currency exchange controls that establish the exchange rate between the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte and the U.S. dollar and restrict the ability to exchange bolivares fuertes for dollars. These restrictions have delayed and limited our ability to pay third-party and affiliated suppliers and to otherwise repatriate funds from Venezuela, and may continue to do so, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. In addition, if we are unable to pay these suppliers in a timely manner, they may cease supplying us. Venezuela has also imposed restrictions on the importation of certain raw materials. If these suppliers cease supplying us or we are unable to import necessary raw materials, we may need to reduce or halt production in Venezuela, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. If we were to reduce or halt production in Venezuela, our ability to mitigate the negative impact of those actions may be limited by government controls over staffing reductions. These and other restrictions could limit our ability to benefit from our investment and maintain a controlling interest in our Venezuelan subsidiary.We have material bolivar fuerte-denominated net monetary assets and liabilities in Venezuela, the value of which will be correspondingly reduced in the event of further devaluations of the bolivar fuerte by the Venezuelan government. 12Table of ContentsThe future results of our Venezuelan operations will be affected by many factors, including actions by the Venezuelan government such as further currency devaluations, profit margin or price controls or changes in import controls; economic conditions in Venezuela such as inflation and consumer spending; labor relations; and the availability of raw materials, utilities and energy. Our Venezuelan subsidiary contributes a significant portion of the sales and operating income of our Latin America segment. As a result, any disruption of our Venezuelan subsidiary's operations or of our ability to pay suppliers or repatriate funds from Venezuela could have a material adverse impact on the future performance of our Latin America segment and could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions.  These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export laws, anti-competition laws, anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, data privacy requirements, tax laws, and accounting, internal control and disclosure requirements.  Violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations.  In certain foreign jurisdictions, there is a higher risk of fraud or corruption and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls and compliance programs.  Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws and regulations.We have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.The financial position and results of operations of many of our international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on our reported sales and operating margin (and conversely, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies has a positive impact). For the year ended December 31, 2014, foreign currency translation unfavorably affected sales by $571 million and unfavorably affected segment operating income by $77 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The volatility of currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results.Raw material and energy costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Raw material costs have historically been volatile, and we may experience increases in the prices of natural and synthetic rubber, carbon black and petrochemical-based commodities. Market conditions or contractual obligations may prevent us from passing any such increased costs on to our customers through timely price increases. Additionally, higher raw material and energy costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. As a result, higher raw material and energy costs could result in declining margins and operating results and adversely affect our financial condition. The volatility of raw material costs may cause our margins, operating results and liquidity to fluctuate. In addition, lower raw material costs may put downward pressure on the price of tires, which could ultimately reduce our margins and adversely affect our results of operations.If we fail to extend or renegotiate our primary collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions as they expire from time to time, or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.We are a party to collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions, which represent a significant number of our employees. Our master collective bargaining agreement with the USW covers approximately 7,600 employees in the United States at December 31, 2014, and expires July 29, 2017. In addition, approximately 11,000 of our employees outside of the United States are covered by union contracts that have expired or are expiring in 2015, primarily in Luxembourg, China, France and India. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory, no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time to time. If we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements, if disputes with our unions arise, or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, we could experience a significant disruption of, or inefficiencies in, our operations or incur higher labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 13Table of ContentsOur long term ability to meet our obligations, to repay maturing indebtedness or to implement strategic initiatives may be dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results.The adequacy of our liquidity depends on our ability to achieve an appropriate combination of operating improvements, financing from third parties and access to capital markets. We may need to undertake additional financing actions in the capital markets in order to ensure that our future liquidity requirements are addressed or to implement strategic initiatives. These actions may include the issuance of additional debt or equity, or the factoring of our accounts receivable.Our access to the capital markets cannot be assured and is dependent on, among other things, the ability and willingness of financial institutions to extend credit on terms that are acceptable to us or our suppliers, or to honor future draws on our existing lines of credit, and the degree of success we have in implementing our strategic initiatives and improving the results of our EMEA business and continuing to grow our North America business. Over the past several years, we have increased our use of supplier financing programs and the factoring of our accounts receivable in order to improve our working capital efficiency and reduce our costs. If these programs become unavailable or less attractive to us or our suppliers, our liquidity could be adversely affected.Future liquidity requirements, or our inability to access cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit, also may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. A substantial portion of our assets is subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness.Our inability to access the capital markets or incur additional debt in the future could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations, and could require us to consider further measures, including deferring planned capital expenditures, reducing discretionary spending, selling additional assets and restructuring existing debt.Financial difficulties, work stoppages, supply disruptions or economic conditions affecting our major OE customers, dealers or suppliers could harm our business.We experienced volatile global industry conditions in 2014, particularly in EMEA and Latin America. As a result of these industry conditions and increased competition, our tire unit shipments in 2014 were essentially flat compared to 2013, and automotive vehicle production and global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict.Although sales to our OE customers account for approximately 20% of our net sales, demand for our products by OE customers and production levels at our facilities are impacted by automotive vehicle production. We may experience future declines in sales volume due to declines in new vehicle sales, the discontinuation or sale of certain OE brands, platforms or programs, increased competition, or weakness in the demand for replacement tires, which could result in us incurring under-absorbed fixed costs at our production facilities or slowing the rate at which we are able to recover those costs.Automotive production can also be affected by labor relation issues, financial difficulties or supply disruptions. Our OE customers could experience production disruptions resulting from their own or supplier labor, financial or supply difficulties. Such events may cause an OE customer to reduce or suspend vehicle production. As a result, an OE customer could halt or significantly reduce purchases of our products, which would harm our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.In addition, the bankruptcy, restructuring or consolidation of one or more of our major OE customers, dealers or suppliers could result in the write-off of accounts receivable, a reduction in purchases of our products or a supply disruption to our facilities, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost-effective manner.Our capital expenditures are limited by our liquidity and capital resources and the amount we have available for capital spending is limited by the need to pay our other expenses and to maintain adequate cash reserves and borrowing capacity to meet unexpected demands that may arise. We believe that our ratio of capital expenditures to sales is lower than the comparable ratio for our principal competitors.Productivity improvements and manufacturing cost improvements may be required to offset potential increases in labor and raw material costs and competitive price pressures. In addition, as part of our strategy to increase the percentage of tires that are produced at our lower-cost production facilities and to increase our capacity to produce higher margin tires, we may need to modernize or expand our facilities.  We are currently planning to build a new manufacturing facility in the Americas and are undertaking significant expansion and modernization projects at certain of our manufacturing facilities in the United States, Brazil, Germany and China.We may not have sufficient resources to implement planned capital expenditures with minimal disruption to our existing manufacturing operations, or within desired time frames and budgets. Any disruption to our operations, delay in implementing capital improvements or unexpected costs may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. 14Table of ContentsIf we are unable to make sufficient capital expenditures, or to maximize the efficiency of the capital expenditures we do make, we may be unable to achieve productivity improvements, which may harm our competitive position, or to manufacture the products necessary to compete successfully in our targeted market segments. In addition, plant construction and modernization may temporarily disrupt our manufacturing operations and lead to temporary increases in our costs.We have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health.We have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 31, 2014, our debt (including capital leases) on a consolidated basis was approximately $6.4 billion. Our substantial amount of debt and other obligations could have important consequences. For example, it could:•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;•impair our ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, acquisitions or general corporate requirements;•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•limit our ability to use cash flows from operating activities in other areas of our business or to return cash to shareholders because we would need to dedicate a substantial portion of these funds for payments on our indebtedness;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.The agreements governing our debt, including our credit agreements, limit, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional debt and we may incur a significant amount of additional debt in the future, including additional secured debt. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, our ability to satisfy our debt obligations may become more limited.Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt and other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to our ability to implement our strategic initiatives, prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we may be forced to reduce or eliminate our share repurchase program and the dividend on our common stock, reduce or delay expansion plans and capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that our operating performance, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient to pay our debt obligations when they become due. We cannot assure you that we would be able to dispose of material assets or operations or restructure our debt or other obligations if necessary or, even if we were able to take such actions, that we could do so on terms that are acceptable to us.Any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our debt instruments, or a material reduction in the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations.The indentures and other agreements governing our secured credit facilities, senior unsecured notes and our other outstanding indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things:•incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock;•pay dividends, repurchase shares or make certain other restricted payments or investments;•incur liens;•sell assets;•incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us;•enter into affiliate transactions;•engage in sale/leaseback transactions; and•engage in certain mergers or consolidations or transfers of substantially all of our assets.Availability under our first lien revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and inventory decline, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under that facility may decrease below its stated amount. In addition, if at any time the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under that facility exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to prepay borrowings and/or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess.Our ability to comply with these covenants or to maintain our borrowing base may be affected by events beyond our control, including deteriorating economic conditions, and these events could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures. We cannot assure you that such waivers, amendments or alternative financing could be obtained, or if obtained, would be on terms acceptable to us. 15Table of ContentsA breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in any of our existing or future financing agreements, including the financial covenants in our secured credit facilities, could result in an event of default under those agreements. Such a default could allow the lenders under our financing agreements, if the agreements so provide, to discontinue lending, to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, and/or to declare all borrowings outstanding thereunder to be due and payable. In addition, the lenders could terminate any commitments they have to provide us with further funds. If any of these events occur, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available to pay in full the total amount of obligations that become due as a result of any such acceleration, or that we will be able to find additional or alternative financing to refinance any such accelerated obligations. Even if we obtain additional or alternative financing, we cannot assure you that it would be on terms that would be acceptable to us.We cannot assure you that we will be able to remain in compliance with the covenants to which we are subject in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from our lenders or amend the covenants.Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.Certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, which would require us to use more of our available cash to service our indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into swap agreements or other hedging arrangements in the future, or that existing or future hedging arrangements will offset increases in interest rates. As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $2.2 billion of variable rate debt outstanding.We have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales.We operate with significant operating and financial leverage. Significant portions of our manufacturing, selling, administrative and general expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with sales. In addition, a significant portion of our interest expense is fixed. There can be no assurance that we would be able to reduce our fixed costs proportionately in response to a decline in our net sales and therefore our competitiveness could be significantly impacted. As a result, a decline in our net sales could result in a higher percentage decline in our income from operations and net income.We may incur significant costs in connection with our contingent liabilities and tax matters.We have significant reserves for contingent liabilities and tax matters.  The major categories of our contingent liabilities include workers' compensation and other employment-related claims, product liability and other tort claims, including asbestos claims, and environmental matters.  Our recorded liabilities and estimates of reasonably possible losses for our contingent liabilities are based on our assessment of potential liability using the information available to us at the time and, where applicable, any past experience and recent and current trends with respect to similar matters.  Our contingent liabilities are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable judicial or administrative decisions could occur which we did not anticipate.  Such an unfavorable decision could include monetary damages, fines or other penalties or an injunction prohibiting us from taking certain actions or selling certain products.  If such an unfavorable decision were to occur, it could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations in the period in which the decision occurs, or in future periods.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations, including with respect to transfer pricing.  While we apply consistent transfer pricing policies and practices globally, support transfer prices through economic studies, seek advance pricing agreements and joint audits to the extent possible and believe our transfer prices to be appropriate, such transfer prices, and related interpretations of tax laws, are occasionally challenged by various taxing authorities globally.  We have received various tax assessments challenging our interpretations of applicable tax laws in various jurisdictions.  Although we believe we have complied with applicable tax laws, have strong positions and defenses and have historically been successful in defending such claims, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in the case we are unsuccessful in the defense of existing or future claims.If we wish to appeal any future adverse judgment in any of these proceedings, we may be required to post an appeal bond with the relevant court.   If we were subject to a significant adverse judgment or experienced an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity, we may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.For further information regarding our contingent liabilities and tax matters, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements, No. 18, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.  For further information regarding our accounting policies with respect to certain of our contingent liabilities and uncertain income tax positions, refer to “Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies.” 16Table of ContentsWe are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating results.We are subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, which has established various standards and regulations applicable to tires sold in the United States and tires sold in a foreign country that are identical or substantially similar to tires sold in the United States. NHTSA has the authority to order the recall of automotive products, including tires, having safety-related defects.The Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation Act, or TREAD Act, imposes numerous requirements with respect to the early warning reporting of warranty claims, property damage claims, and bodily injury and fatality claims and also requires tire manufacturers, among other things, to comply with revised and more rigorous tire testing standards. Compliance with the TREAD Act regulations has increased the cost of producing and distributing tires in the United States. In addition, while we believe that our tires are free from design and manufacturing defects, it is possible that a recall of our tires, under the TREAD Act or otherwise, could occur in the future. A substantial recall could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and financial condition.In addition, as required by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, NHTSA will establish a national tire fuel efficiency consumer information program. When the related rule-making process is completed, certain tires sold in the United States will be required to be rated for rolling resistance, traction and tread wear. While the Federal law will preempt state tire fuel efficiency laws adopted after January 1, 2006, we may become subject to additional tire fuel efficiency legislation, either in the United States or other countries.Our European operations are subject to regulation by the European Union. In 2009, two important regulations, the Tire Safety Regulation and the Tire Labeling Regulation, applicable to tires sold in the European Union were adopted. The Tire Safety Regulation sets performance standards that tires for cars and light and commercial trucks need to meet for rolling resistance, wet grip braking (passenger car tires only) and noise in order to be sold in the European Union, and became effective beginning in 2012, with continuing phases that will become effective through 2020. The Tire Labeling Regulation applies to all passenger car, light truck and commercial truck tires and requires that consumers be informed about the tire's fuel efficiency, wet grip and noise characteristics. Other countries, such as Brazil, have also adopted tire labeling regulations, and additional countries may also introduce similar regulations in the future.Tires produced or sold in Europe also have to comply with various other standards, including environmental laws such as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemical Substances), which regulates the use of chemicals in the European Union. For example, REACH prohibits the use of highly aromatic oils in tires, which were used as compounding components to improve certain performance characteristics.These U.S. and European regulations, rules adopted to implement these regulations, or other similar regulations that may be adopted in the United States, Europe or elsewhere in the future may require us to alter or increase our capital spending and research and development plans or cease the production of certain tires, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Laws and regulations governing environmental and occupational safety and health are complicated, change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time. As a manufacturing company, we are subject to these laws and regulations both inside and outside the United States. We may not be in complete compliance with such laws and regulations at all times. Our costs or liabilities relating to them may be more than the amount we have reserved, and that difference may be material.In addition, our manufacturing facilities may become subject to further limitations on the emission of “greenhouse gases” due to public policy concerns regarding climate change issues or other environmental or health and safety concerns. While the form of any additional regulations cannot be predicted, a “cap-and-trade” system similar to the one adopted in the European Union could be adopted in the United States. Any such “cap-and-trade” system (including the system currently in place in the European Union) or other limitations imposed on the emission of “greenhouse gases” could require us to increase our capital expenditures, use our cash to acquire emission credits or restructure our manufacturing operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.Compliance with the laws and regulations described above or any of the myriad of applicable foreign, Federal, state and local laws and regulations currently in effect or that may be adopted in the future could materially adversely affect our competitive position, operating results, financial condition and liquidity. 17Table of ContentsThe arbitration proceedings we have brought to dissolve our global alliance with SRI and the terms and conditions of the existing global alliance agreements with SRI could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire SRI’s interest in our European and North American joint ventures.We have commenced arbitration proceedings seeking the dissolution of our global alliance with SRI, damages and other appropriate relief.  Subject to those arbitration proceedings, under the existing global alliance agreements between us and SRI, SRI would have the right to require us to purchase its ownership interests in GDTE and GDTNA if certain triggering events have occurred, including certain bankruptcy events, changes in control of Goodyear or breaches of the global alliance agreements. Any payment required to be made to SRI in respect of the dissolution of the global alliance, which could be offset by payments to us for damages, or pursuant to an exit under the terms of the global alliance agreements could be substantial. If the amount of such a payment exceeds our current expectations, we cannot assure you that our operating performance, cash flow and capital resources would be sufficient to make such a payment or, if we were able to make the payment, that there would be sufficient funds remaining to satisfy our other obligations. For further information regarding our global alliance with SRI, including the events that could trigger SRI’s exit rights, refer to “Item 1. Business. Description of Goodyear’s Business - Global Alliance.”We may be adversely affected by any disruption in, or failure of, our information technology systems.We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology, or IT, systems across all of our major business functions, including our research and development, manufacturing, retail, financial and administrative functions.  We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing upgrades when necessary.  Our security measures are focused on the prevention, detection and remediation of damage from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber attack and other similar disruptions.  We may incur significant costs in order to implement the security measures that we feel are necessary to protect our IT systems.  However, our IT systems may remain vulnerable to damage despite our implementation of security measures that we deem to be appropriate.Any system failure, accident or security breach involving our IT systems could result in disruptions to our operations.  A material breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets, negatively impact our manufacturing or retail operations, or result in the compromise of personal information of our employees, customers or suppliers.  To the extent that any system failure, accident or security breach results in disruptions to our operations or the theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our data or confidential information, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially adversely affected.Our business substantially depends on the continued service of key members of our management. The loss of the services of a significant number of members of our management could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, such as engineering, marketing and senior management professionals. Competition for these employees is intense, and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting new high quality employees, our business could be materially adversely affected.We may be impacted by economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters.We manage businesses and facilities worldwide. Our facilities and operations, and the facilities and operations of our suppliers and customers, could be disrupted by events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters. Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales and customers. We may not be insured against all such potential losses and, if insured, the insurance proceeds that we receive may not adequately compensate us for all of our losses"
5,GT,GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER CO,2014-02-13,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when considering an investment decision with respect to our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If they do, our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be materially adversely affected. In such an instance, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment.If we do not successfully implement our strategic initiatives, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.We experienced weak, but stabilizing, industry conditions in developed markets in 2013 as the economic recovery in Europe and the United States remained tentative, and our business continues to be impacted by trends that have negatively affected the tire industry in general. These negative trends include continued economic weakness in Europe, economic and political volatility in Latin America, rising energy costs, wage inflation in emerging markets, and volatile raw material costs. In addition, global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict. If these overall trends continue or worsen, then our operational and financial condition could be adversely affected.In order to offset the impact of these trends, we have announced important strategic initiatives, such as our operational excellence initiatives, increasing our low-cost manufacturing capacity, reducing our high-cost manufacturing capacity, such as the closure of one of our facilities in Amiens, France, increasing sales in emerging markets, and improving the profitability of our EMEA segment. We are also undertaking significant capital investments in expanding and modernizing manufacturing facilities around the world. The failure to implement successfully our important strategic initiatives may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.Our operational excellence initiatives are aimed at improving our manufacturing efficiency and creating an advantaged supply chain focused on reducing our total delivered costs, optimizing working capital levels and delivering best in industry customer service. If we fail to execute these initiatives successfully, we may fail to achieve our financial goals.If economic and political conditions in emerging markets, such as Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, China and India, deteriorate significantly, we may not be able to increase our sales in emerging markets and our operating results, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.Our performance is also dependent on our ability to improve the volume and mix of higher margin tires we sell in our targeted market segments. In order to do so, we must be successful in developing, marketing and selling products that consumers desire and that offer higher margins to us. Shifts in consumer demand away from higher margin tires could materially adversely affect our business.We cannot assure you that our strategic initiatives will be successful. If not, we may not be able to achieve or sustain future profitability, which would impair our ability to meet our debt and other obligations and would otherwise negatively affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We face significant global competition and our market share could decline.New tires are sold under highly competitive conditions throughout the world. We compete with other tire manufacturers on the basis of product design, performance, price and terms, reputation, warranty terms, customer service and consumer convenience. On a worldwide basis, we have two major competitors, Bridgestone (based in Japan) and Michelin (based in France), that have large shares of the markets of the countries in which they are based and are aggressively seeking to maintain or improve their worldwide market share. Other significant competitors include Continental, Cooper, Hankook, Kumho, Pirelli, Toyo, Yokohama and various regional tire manufacturers. Our competitors produce significant numbers of tires in low-cost countries, and have announced plans to further increase their production capacity in low-cost countries. Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in significant part, on our ability to continue to innovate and manufacture the types of tires demanded by consumers, and to reduce costs by such means as reducing excess and high-cost capacity, leveraging global purchasing, improving productivity, eliminating redundancies and increasing production at low-cost supply sources. If we are unable to compete successfully, our market share may decline, materially adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition.Raw material and energy costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Raw material costs have been volatile over the past few years, and we may experience increases in the prices of natural and synthetic rubber, carbon black and petrochemical-based commodities. Market conditions or contractual obligations may prevent us from passing any such increased costs on to our customers through timely price increases. Additionally, higher raw material and energy costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. As a result, higher raw material and energy costs could  12Table of Contentsresult in declining margins and operating results and adversely affect our financial condition. The volatility of raw material costs may cause our margins, operating results and liquidity to fluctuate. In addition, lower raw material costs may put downward pressure on the price of tires, which could ultimately reduce our margins and adversely affect our results of operations.If we fail to extend or renegotiate our primary collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions as they expire from time to time, or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.We are a party to collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions, which represent a significant number of our employees. Our master collective bargaining agreement with the USW covers approximately 7,500 employees in the United States at December 31, 2013, and expires July 29, 2017. In addition, approximately 22,000 of our employees outside of the United States are covered by union contracts that have expired or are expiring in 2014, primarily in Germany, Brazil, France, Poland, China and Venezuela. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory, no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time to time. If we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements, if disputes with our unions arise, or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, we could experience a significant disruption of, or inefficiencies in, our operations or incur higher labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity.Our long term ability to meet our obligations, to repay maturing indebtedness or to implement strategic initiatives may be dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results.The adequacy of our liquidity depends on our ability to achieve an appropriate combination of operating improvements, financing from third parties and access to capital markets. We may need to undertake additional financing actions in the capital markets in order to ensure that our future liquidity requirements are addressed or to implement strategic initiatives. These actions may include the issuance of additional debt or equity, or the factoring of our accounts receivable.Our access to the capital markets cannot be assured and is dependent on, among other things, the ability and willingness of financial institutions to extend credit on terms that are acceptable to us or our suppliers, or to honor future draws on our existing lines of credit, and the degree of success we have in implementing our strategic initiatives and improving the results of our EMEA segment and sustaining our results in our North America segment. Over the past several years, we have increased our use of supplier financing programs and the factoring of our accounts receivable in order to improve our working capital efficiency and reduce our costs. If these programs become unavailable or less attractive to us or our suppliers, our liquidity could be adversely affected.Future liquidity requirements, or our inability to access cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit, also may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. A substantial portion of our assets is subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness.Our inability to access the capital markets or incur additional debt in the future could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations, and could require us to consider further measures, including deferring planned capital expenditures, reducing discretionary spending, selling additional assets and restructuring existing debt.Financial difficulties, work stoppages, supply disruptions or economic conditions affecting our major OE customers, dealers or suppliers could harm our business.We continued to experience weak, but stabilizing, industry conditions in developed markets in 2013 as the economic recovery in Europe and the United States remained tentative. As a result of these economic conditions and increased competition, our tire unit shipments in 2013 were down 1.1% compared to 2012, and automotive vehicle production and global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict.Although sales to our OE customers account for approximately 20% of our net sales, demand for our products by OE customers and production levels at our facilities are impacted by automotive vehicle production. We may experience future declines in sales volume due to declines in new vehicle sales, the discontinuation or sale of certain OE brands, platforms or programs, or weakness in the demand for replacement tires, which could result in us incurring under-absorbed fixed costs at our production facilities or slowing the rate at which we are able to recover those costs.Automotive production can also be affected by labor relation issues, financial difficulties or supply disruptions. Our OE customers could experience production disruptions resulting from their own or supplier labor, financial or supply difficulties. Such events may cause an OE customer to reduce or suspend vehicle production. As a result, an OE customer could halt or significantly reduce purchases of our products, which would harm our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 13Table of ContentsIn addition, the bankruptcy, restructuring or consolidation of one or more of our major OE customers, dealers or suppliers could result in the write-off of accounts receivable, a reduction in purchases of our products or a supply disruption to our facilities, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost-effective manner.Our capital expenditures are limited by our liquidity and capital resources and the amount we have available for capital spending is limited by the need to pay our other expenses and to maintain adequate cash reserves and borrowing capacity to meet unexpected demands that may arise. We believe that our ratio of capital expenditures to sales is lower than the comparable ratio for our principal competitors.Productivity improvements through process re-engineering, design efficiency and manufacturing cost improvements may be required to offset potential increases in labor and raw material costs and competitive price pressures. In addition, as part of our strategy to increase the percentage of tires that are produced at our lower-cost production facilities and to increase our capacity to produce higher margin tires, we may need to modernize or expand our facilities.  We are currently undertaking significant expansion and modernization projects at certain of our manufacturing facilities in Brazil, Germany and Japan.We may not have sufficient resources to implement planned capital expenditures with minimal disruption to our existing manufacturing operations, or within desired time frames and budgets. Any disruption to our operations, delay in implementing capital improvements or unexpected costs may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.If we are unable to make sufficient capital expenditures, or to maximize the efficiency of the capital expenditures we do make, we may be unable to achieve productivity improvements, which may harm our competitive position, or to manufacture the products necessary to compete successfully in our targeted market segments. In addition, plant modernizations may temporarily disrupt our manufacturing operations and lead to temporary increases in our costs.We have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health.We have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 31, 2013, our debt (including capital leases) on a consolidated basis was approximately $6.2 billion. Our substantial amount of debt and other obligations could have important consequences. For example, it could:•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;•impair our ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, acquisitions or general corporate requirements;•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we would need to dedicate a substantial portion of these funds for payments on our indebtedness;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.The agreements governing our debt, including our credit agreements, limit, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional debt and we may incur a significant amount of additional debt in the future, including additional secured debt. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, our ability to satisfy our debt obligations may become more limited.Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt and other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to our ability to implement our strategic initiatives, prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay expansion plans and capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that our operating performance, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient to pay our debt obligations when they become due. We cannot assure you that we would be able to dispose of material assets or operations or restructure our debt or other obligations if necessary or, even if we were able to take such actions, that we could do so on terms that are acceptable to us. 14Table of ContentsAny failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our debt instruments, or a material reduction in the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations.The indentures and other agreements governing our secured credit facilities, senior unsecured notes and our other outstanding indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things:•incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock;•pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments or investments;•incur liens;•sell assets;•incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us;•enter into affiliate transactions;•engage in sale/leaseback transactions; and•engage in certain mergers or consolidations or transfers of substantially all of our assets.Availability under our first lien revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and inventory decline, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under that facility may decrease below its stated amount. In addition, if at any time the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under that facility exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to prepay borrowings and/or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess.Our ability to comply with these covenants or to maintain our borrowing base may be affected by events beyond our control, including deteriorating economic conditions, and these events could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures. We cannot assure you that such waivers, amendments or alternative financing could be obtained, or if obtained, would be on terms acceptable to us.A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in any of our existing or future financing agreements, including the financial covenants in our secured credit facilities, could result in an event of default under those agreements. Such a default could allow the lenders under our financing agreements, if the agreements so provide, to discontinue lending, to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, and/or to declare all borrowings outstanding thereunder to be due and payable. In addition, the lenders could terminate any commitments they have to provide us with further funds. If any of these events occur, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available to pay in full the total amount of obligations that become due as a result of any such acceleration, or that we will be able to find additional or alternative financing to refinance any such accelerated obligations. Even if we obtain additional or alternative financing, we cannot assure you that it would be on terms that would be acceptable to us.We cannot assure you that we will be able to remain in compliance with the covenants to which we are subject in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from our lenders or amend the covenants.Our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We have manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the world. Our international operations are subject to certain inherent risks, including:•exposure to local economic conditions;•adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States;•hostility from local populations and insurrections;•adverse foreign currency fluctuations;•adverse currency exchange controls;•government price controls;•withholding taxes and restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings;•labor regulations;•expropriations of property;•the potential instability of foreign governments;•risks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities;•export and import restrictions; and•other changes in laws or government policies. 15Table of ContentsThe likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable. Certain regions, including Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa, are inherently more economically and politically volatile and as a result, our business units that operate in these regions could be subject to significant fluctuations in sales and operating income from quarter to quarter. Because a significant percentage of our operating income in recent years has come from these regions, adverse fluctuations in the operating results in these regions could have a disproportionate impact on our results of operations in future periods.For example, since 2003, Venezuela has imposed currency exchange controls that fix the exchange rate between the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte and the U.S. dollar and restrict the ability to exchange bolivares fuertes for dollars. These restrictions have delayed and limited our ability to pay third-party and affiliated suppliers and to otherwise repatriate funds from Venezuela, and may continue to do so, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. In addition, if we are unable to pay these suppliers in a timely manner, they may cease supplying us. Venezuela has also imposed restrictions on the importation of certain raw materials. If these suppliers cease supplying us or we are unable to import necessary raw materials, we may need to reduce or halt production in Venezuela, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.We have material bolivar fuerte-denominated net monetary assets and liabilities in Venezuela, the value of which will be correspondingly reduced in the event of further devaluations of the bolivar fuerte by the Venezuelan government.The future results of our Venezuelan operations will be affected by many factors, including actions by the Venezuelan government such as further currency devaluations, profit margin or price controls or changes in import controls, economic conditions in Venezuela such as inflation and consumer spending, labor relations, and the availability of raw materials, utilities and energy. Goodyear Venezuela contributes a significant portion of the sales and operating income of our Latin America segment. As a result, any disruption of Goodyear Venezuela’s operations or of our ability to pay suppliers or repatriate funds from Venezuela could have a material adverse impact on the future performance of our Latin America segment and could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions.  These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export laws, anti-competition laws, anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, data privacy requirements, tax laws, and accounting, internal control and disclosure requirements.  Violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations.  In certain foreign jurisdictions, there is a higher risk of fraud or corruption and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls and compliance programs.  Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws and regulations.We have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.The financial position and results of operations of many of our international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on our reported sales and operating margin (and conversely, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies has a positive impact). For the year ended December 31, 2013, foreign currency translation unfavorably affected sales by $354 million and unfavorably affected segment operating income by $63 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. The volatility of currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results.Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.Certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, which would require us to use more of our available cash to service our indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into swap agreements or other hedging arrangements in the future, or that existing or future hedging arrangements will offset increases in interest rates. As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately $2.1 billion of variable rate debt outstanding. 16Table of ContentsWe have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales.We operate with significant operating and financial leverage. Significant portions of our manufacturing, selling, administrative and general expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with sales. In addition, a significant portion of our interest expense is fixed. There can be no assurance that we would be able to reduce our fixed costs proportionately in response to a decline in our net sales and therefore our competitiveness could be significantly impacted. As a result, a decline in our net sales could result in a higher percentage decline in our income from operations and net income.We may incur significant costs in connection with our contingent liabilities and tax matters.We have significant reserves for contingent liabilities and tax matters.  The major categories of our contingent liabilities include workers' compensation and other employment-related claims, product liability and other tort claims, including asbestos claims, and environmental matters.Our recorded liabilities and estimates of reasonably possible losses for our contingent liabilities are based on our assessment of potential liability using the information available to us at the time and, where applicable, any past experience and recent and current trends with respect to similar matters.  Our contingent liabilities are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable judicial or administrative decisions could occur which we did not anticipate.  Such an unfavorable decision could include monetary damages, fines or other penalties or an injunction prohibiting us from taking certain actions or selling certain products.  If such an unfavorable decision were to occur, it could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations in the period in which the decision occurs, or in future periods.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations, including with respect to transfer pricing.  While we apply consistent transfer pricing policies and practices globally, support transfer prices through economic studies, seek advance pricing agreements and joint audits to the extent possible and believe our transfer prices to be appropriate, such transfer prices, and related interpretations of tax laws, are occasionally challenged by various taxing authorities globally.  We have received various tax assessments challenging our interpretations of applicable tax laws in various jurisdictions.  Although we believe we have complied with applicable tax laws, have strong positions and defenses and have historically been successful in defending such claims, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in the case we are unsuccessful in the defense of existing or future claims.If we wish to appeal any future adverse judgment in any of these proceedings, we may be required to post an appeal bond with the relevant court. If we were subject to a significant adverse judgment or experienced an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity, we may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.For further information regarding our contingent liabilities and tax matters, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements, No. 18, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. For further information regarding our accounting policies with respect to certain of our contingent liabilities and uncertain income tax positions, refer to “Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies.”We are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating results.We are subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, which has established various standards and regulations applicable to tires sold in the United States and tires sold in a foreign country that are identical or substantially similar to tires sold in the United States. NHTSA has the authority to order the recall of automotive products, including tires, having safety-related defects.The Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation Act, or TREAD Act, imposes numerous requirements with respect to the early warning reporting of warranty claims, property damage claims, and bodily injury and fatality claims and also requires tire manufacturers, among other things, to comply with revised and more rigorous tire testing standards. Compliance with the TREAD Act regulations has increased the cost of producing and distributing tires in the United States. In addition, while we believe that our tires are free from design and manufacturing defects, it is possible that a recall of our tires, under the TREAD Act or otherwise, could occur in the future. A substantial recall could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and financial position.In addition, as required by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, NHTSA will establish a national tire fuel efficiency consumer information program. When the related rule-making process is completed, certain tires sold in the United States will be required to be rated for rolling resistance, traction and tread wear. While the Federal law will preempt state tire fuel efficiency laws adopted after January 1, 2006, we may become subject to additional tire fuel efficiency legislation, either in the United States or other countries. 17Table of ContentsOur European operations are subject to regulation by the European Union. In 2009, two important regulations, the Tire Safety Regulation and the Tire Labeling Regulation, applicable to tires sold in the European Union were adopted. The Tire Safety Regulation sets performance standards that tires for cars and light and commercial trucks need to meet for rolling resistance, wet grip braking (passenger car tires only) and noise in order to be sold in the European Union, and became effective beginning in 2012, with continuing phases that will become effective through 2020. The Tire Labeling Regulation applies to all passenger car, light truck and commercial truck tires and requires that consumers be informed about the tire's fuel efficiency, wet grip and noise characteristics. Other countries, such as Brazil, have also adopted tire labeling regulations, and additional countries may also introduce similar regulations in the future.Tires produced or sold in Europe also have to comply with various other standards, including environmental laws such as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemical Substances), which regulates the use of chemicals in the European Union. For example, REACH prohibits the use of highly aromatic oils in tires, which were used as compounding components to improve certain performance characteristics.These U.S. and European regulations, rules adopted to implement these regulations, or other similar regulations that may be adopted in the United States, Europe or elsewhere in the future may require us to alter or increase our capital spending and research and development plans or cease the production of certain tires, which could have a material adverse affect on our operating results.Laws and regulations governing environmental and occupational safety and health are complicated, change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time. As a manufacturing company, we are subject to these laws and regulations both inside and outside the United States. We may not be in complete compliance with such laws and regulations at all times. Our costs or liabilities relating to them may be more than the amount we have reserved, and that difference may be material.In addition, our manufacturing facilities may become subject to further limitations on the emission of “greenhouse gases” due to public policy concerns regarding climate change issues or other environmental or health and safety concerns. While the form of any additional regulations cannot be predicted, a “cap-and-trade” system similar to the one adopted in the European Union could be adopted in the United States. Any such “cap-and-trade” system (including the system currently in place in the European Union) or other limitations imposed on the emission of “greenhouse gases” could require us to increase our capital expenditures, use our cash to acquire emission credits or restructure our manufacturing operations, which could have a material adverse affect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.Compliance with the laws and regulations described above or any of the myriad of applicable foreign, Federal, state and local laws and regulations currently in effect or that may be adopted in the future could materially adversely affect our competitive position, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.The arbitration proceedings we have brought to dissolve our global alliance with SRI and the terms and conditions of the existing global alliance agreements with SRI could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire SRI’s interest in our European and North American joint ventures.We have commenced arbitration proceedings seeking the dissolution of our global alliance with SRI, damages and other appropriate relief.  Subject to those arbitration proceedings, under the existing global alliance agreements between us and SRI, SRI would have the right to require us to purchase its ownership interests in GDTE and GDTNA if certain triggering events have occurred, including certain bankruptcy events, changes in control of Goodyear or breaches of the global alliance agreements. Any payment required to be made to SRI in respect of the dissolution of the global alliance, which could be offset by payments to us for damages, or pursuant to an exit under the terms of the global alliance agreements could be substantial. If the amount of such a payment exceeds our current expectations, we cannot assure you that our operating performance, cash flow and capital resources would be sufficient to make such a payment or, if we were able to make the payment, that there would be sufficient funds remaining to satisfy our other obligations. For further information regarding our global alliance with SRI, including the events that could trigger SRI’s exit rights, see “Item 1. Business. Description of Goodyear’s Business - Global Alliance.”We may be adversely affected by any disruption in, or failure of, our information technology systems.We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology, or IT, systems across all of our major business functions, including our research and development, manufacturing, retail, financial and administrative functions.  We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing upgrades when necessary.  Our security measures are focused on the prevention, detection and remediation of damage from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber attack and other similar disruptions.  We may incur significant costs in order to implement the security measures that we feel are necessary to protect our IT systems.  However, our IT systems may remain vulnerable to damage despite our implementation of security measures that we deem to be appropriate.Any system failure, accident or security breach involving our IT systems could result in disruptions to our operations.  A material breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets, negatively impact our manufacturing or retail operations, or result in the compromise of personal information of our employees, customers or suppliers.   18Table of ContentsTo the extent that any system failure, accident or security breach results in disruptions to our operations or the theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our data or confidential information, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially adversely affected.Our business substantially depends on the continued service of key members of our management. The loss of the services of a significant number of members of our management could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, such as engineering, marketing and senior management professionals. Competition for these employees is intense, and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting new high quality employees, our business could be materially adversely affected.We may be impacted by economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters.We manage businesses and facilities worldwide. Our facilities and operations, and the facilities and operations of our suppliers and customers, could be disrupted by events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters. Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales and customers. We may not be insured against all such potential losses and, if insured, the insurance proceeds that we receive may not adequately compensate us for all of our losses"
6,GT,GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER CO,2013-02-12,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when considering an investment decision with respect to our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If they do, our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be materially adversely affected. In such an instance, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment.If we do not successfully implement our strategic initiatives, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.Our business continues to be impacted by trends that have negatively affected the tire industry in general, as the economic recovery in developed markets was impacted by uncertainty surrounding debt and other fiscal policy issues in Europe and the United States and continued high levels of unemployment.  These negative trends include volatile raw material costs, rising energy costs, wage inflation in emerging markets, and continued pressure from our unfunded pension obligations.  In addition, global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict. If these overall trends continue or worsen, then our operational and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Unlike most other tire manufacturers, we also face the continuing burden of significant legacy pension costs.In order to offset the impact of these trends, we have announced important strategic initiatives, such as increasing our low-cost manufacturing capacity, reducing our high-cost manufacturing capacity, such as the announced closure of one of our facilities in Amiens, France, increasing sales in emerging markets, improving the profitability of our EMEA segment, and funding our U.S. pension plans once frozen. We are also undertaking significant capital investments in new, expanded and modernized manufacturing facilities around the world. The failure to implement successfully our important strategic initiatives may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.The announced closure of one of our facilities in Amiens, France remains subject to consultation with the European Central Works Council, our employee representatives and other relevant bodies in the EMEA region.  As the required consultation process has just begun, we are not able to currently estimate the timing of plan completion nor can we assure you of the ultimate outcome of the consultation process.Implementation of our pension funding strategy depends on, among other things, our ability to access the debt capital markets.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to access those markets on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.  See the risk factor below concerning our ability to access the capital markets, “Our long term ability to meet our obligations, to repay maturing indebtedness or to implement strategic initiatives may be dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results.”Our performance is also dependent on our ability to continue to improve the proportion, or mix, of higher margin tires we sell. In order to continue this improvement, we must be successful in marketing and selling products that offer higher margins such as the Assurance, Fuel Max, Eagle, Ultra Grip and Fortera lines of tires and in developing additional higher margin tires that achieve broad market acceptance. Shifts in consumer demand away from higher margin tires could materially adversely affect our business.We cannot assure you that our strategic initiatives will be successful. If not, we may not be able to achieve or sustain future profitability, which would impair our ability to meet our debt and other obligations and would otherwise negatively affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.Our pension plans are significantly underfunded and, in the future, the underfunding levels of our pension plans and our pension expense could materially increase.Although we have frozen a number of our pension plans globally, including our U.S. salaried pension plans, and closed participation in our primary U.S. hourly pension plan, many of our employees participate in, and many of our former employees are entitled to benefits under, defined benefit pension plans. Over time, we have experienced periods of declines in interest rates and pension asset values. As a result, our pension plans are significantly underfunded. Further declines in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plans, or certain other changes, could materially increase the underfunded status of our plans in 2013 and beyond and affect the level and timing of required contributions in 2014 and beyond.  For further information regarding the investment funds and strategies of our pension plans, see “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview — Pension and Benefit Plans” and the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 16, Pension, Other Postretirement Benefits and Savings Plans.  The unfunded amount of the projected benefit obligation for our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans was $2,656 million and $866 million, respectively, at December 31, 2012, and we currently estimate that we will be required to make contributions to our funded U.S. pension plans of approximately $175 million to $200 million in 2013, and $375 million to $425 million in 2014. The current underfunded status of our pension plans will, and a further 11Table of Contentsmaterial increase in the underfunded status of the plans would, significantly increase our required contributions and pension expense, which could impair our ability to achieve or sustain future profitability and adversely affect our financial condition.We face significant global competition and our market share could decline.New tires are sold under highly competitive conditions throughout the world. We compete with other tire manufacturers on the basis of product design, performance, price and terms, reputation, warranty terms, customer service and consumer convenience. On a worldwide basis, we have two major competitors, Bridgestone (based in Japan) and Michelin (based in France), that have large shares of the markets of the countries in which they are based and are aggressively seeking to maintain or improve their worldwide market share. Other significant competitors include Continental, Cooper, Hankook, Kumho, Pirelli, Toyo, Yokohama and various regional tire manufacturers. Our competitors produce significant numbers of tires in low-cost countries, and have announced plans to further increase their production capacity in low-cost countries. Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in significant part, on our ability to continue to innovate and manufacture the types of tires demanded by consumers, and to reduce costs by such means as reducing excess and high-cost capacity, leveraging global purchasing, improving productivity, eliminating redundancies and increasing production at low-cost supply sources. If we are unable to compete successfully, our market share may decline, materially adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition.Higher raw material and energy costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Raw material costs increased significantly over the past few years, and may continue to do so, driven by increases in prices of natural and synthetic rubber, carbon black and petrochemical-based commodities. Market conditions or contractual obligations may prevent us from passing these increased costs on to our customers through timely price increases. Additionally, higher raw material costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. As a result, higher raw material and energy costs could result in declining margins and operating results and adversely affect our financial condition. The volatility of raw material costs may cause our margins, operating results and liquidity to fluctuate.If we fail to extend or renegotiate our primary collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions as they expire from time to time, or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.We are a party to collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions, which represent a significant number of our employees. Our master collective bargaining agreement with the USW covers approximately 8,000 employees in the United States at December 31, 2012, and expires July 27, 2013. In addition, approximately 23,000 of our employees outside of the United States are covered by union contracts that have expired or are expiring in 2013, primarily in Germany, France, Poland, Brazil, China and Venezuela. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory, no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time to time. If we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements, if disputes with our unions arise, or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, we could experience a significant disruption of, or inefficiencies in, our operations or incur higher labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity.Our long term ability to meet our obligations, to repay maturing indebtedness or to implement strategic initiatives may be dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results.The adequacy of our liquidity depends on our ability to achieve an appropriate combination of operating improvements, financing from third parties and access to capital markets. We may need to undertake additional financing actions in the capital markets in order to ensure that our future liquidity requirements are addressed or to implement strategic initiatives. These actions may include the issuance of additional debt or equity.Our access to the capital markets cannot be assured and is dependent on, among other things, the ability and willingness of financial institutions to extend credit on terms that are acceptable to us, or to honor future draws on our existing lines of credit, and the degree of success we have in implementing our strategic initiatives and improving the results of our EMEA segment and sustaining our results in our North American Tire segment. Concerns regarding the effect of the European sovereign debt crisis on financial institutions in Europe and elsewhere could have an adverse impact on the European and global capital markets and on our ability to access those markets to finance our European business or our business globally. Future liquidity requirements, or our inability to access cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit, also may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. A substantial portion of our assets is subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness.12Table of ContentsOur inability to access the capital markets or incur additional debt in the future could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations, and could require us to consider further measures, including deferring planned capital expenditures or our pension funding strategy, reducing discretionary spending, selling additional assets and restructuring existing debt.Financial difficulties, work stoppages, supply disruptions or economic conditions affecting our major OE customers, dealers or suppliers could harm our business.The economic recovery in developed markets has been negatively impacted by uncertainty surrounding debt and other fiscal policy issues in Europe and the United States and continued high levels of unemployment.  As a result of these economic conditions, our tire unit shipments in 2012 were down 9.2% compared to 2011, and automotive vehicle production and global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict.Although sales to our OE customers account for less than 25% of our net sales, demand for our products by OE customers and production levels at our facilities are impacted by automotive vehicle production. We may experience future declines in sales volume due to declines in new vehicle sales, the discontinuation or sale of certain OE brands, platforms or programs, or weakness in the demand for replacement tires, which could result in us incurring under-absorbed fixed costs at our production facilities or slowing the rate at which we are able to recover those costs.Automotive production can also be affected by labor relation issues, financial difficulties or supply disruptions. Our OE customers could experience production disruptions resulting from their own or supplier labor, financial or supply difficulties. Such events may cause an OE customer to reduce or suspend vehicle production. As a result, an OE customer could halt or significantly reduce purchases of our products, which would harm our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.In addition, the bankruptcy, restructuring or consolidation of one or more of our major OE customers, dealers or suppliers could result in the write-off of accounts receivable, a reduction in purchases of our products or a supply disruption to our facilities, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost-effective manner.Our capital expenditures are limited by our liquidity and capital resources and the amount we have available for capital spending is limited by the need to pay our other expenses and to maintain adequate cash reserves and borrowing capacity to meet unexpected demands that may arise. We believe that our ratio of capital expenditures to sales is lower than the comparable ratio for our principal competitors.Productivity improvements through process re-engineering, design efficiency and manufacturing cost improvements may be required to offset potential increases in labor and raw material costs and competitive price pressures. In addition, as part of our strategy to increase the percentage of tires that are produced at our lower-cost production facilities and to increase our capacity to produce higher margin tires, we may need to modernize or expand our facilities. For example, we made a significant investment in a new manufacturing facility in Pulandian, China, which began tire production in 2011.  We are also currently undertaking significant expansion and modernization projects at our manufacturing facilities in Santiago, Chile; Tatsuno, Japan; Americana, Brazil; Lawton, Oklahoma; and throughout EMEA in connection with new European tire labeling requirements. We may not have sufficient resources to implement planned capital expenditures with minimal disruption to our existing manufacturing operations, or within desired time frames and budgets. Any disruption to our operations, delay in implementing capital improvements or unexpected costs may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.If we are unable to make sufficient capital expenditures, or to maximize the efficiency of the capital expenditures we do make, we may be unable to achieve productivity improvements, which may harm our competitive position. In addition, plant modernizations may temporarily disrupt our manufacturing operations and lead to temporary increases in our costs.13Table of ContentsWe have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health.We have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 31, 2012, our debt (including capital leases) on a consolidated basis was approximately $5.1 billion. Our substantial amount of debt and other obligations could have important consequences. For example, it could:•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;•impair our ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, pension funding, research and development, acquisitions or general corporate requirements;•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we would need to dedicate a substantial portion of these funds for payments on our indebtedness;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.The agreements governing our debt, including our credit agreements, limit, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional debt and we may incur a significant amount of additional debt in the future, including additional secured debt. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, our ability to satisfy our debt obligations may become more limited.Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt and other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to our ability to implement our strategic initiatives, prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, including required pension contributions, we may be forced to reduce or delay expansion plans and capital expenditures or our pension funding strategy, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that our operating performance, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient to pay our debt obligations when they become due. We cannot assure you that we would be able to dispose of material assets or operations or restructure our debt or other obligations if necessary or, even if we were able to take such actions, that we could do so on terms that are acceptable to us.Any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our debt instruments, or a material reduction in the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations.The indentures and other agreements governing our secured credit facilities, senior unsecured notes and our other outstanding indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things:•incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock;•pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments or investments;•incur liens;•sell assets;•incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us;•enter into affiliate transactions;•engage in sale/leaseback transactions; and•engage in certain mergers or consolidations or transfers of substantially all of our assets.Availability under our first lien revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and inventory decline, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under that facility may decrease below its stated amount. In addition, if at any time the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under that facility exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to prepay borrowings and/or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess.Our ability to comply with these covenants or to maintain our borrowing base may be affected by events beyond our control, including deteriorating economic conditions, and these events could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures. We cannot assure you that such waivers, amendments or alternative financing could be obtained, or if obtained, would be on terms acceptable to us.A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in any of our existing or future financing agreements, including the financial covenants in our secured credit facilities, could result in an event of default under those agreements. Such a default could allow the lenders under our financing agreements, if the agreements so provide, to discontinue lending, to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, and/or to declare all borrowings 14Table of Contentsoutstanding thereunder to be due and payable. In addition, the lenders could terminate any commitments they have to provide us with further funds. If any of these events occur, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available to pay in full the total amount of obligations that become due as a result of any such acceleration, or that we will be able to find additional or alternative financing to refinance any such accelerated obligations. Even if we obtain additional or alternative financing, we cannot assure you that it would be on terms that would be acceptable to us.We cannot assure you that we will be able to remain in compliance with the covenants to which we are subject in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from our lenders or amend the covenants.Our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We have manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the world. Our international operations are subject to certain inherent risks, including:•exposure to local economic conditions;•adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States;•hostility from local populations and insurrections;•adverse foreign currency fluctuations;•adverse currency exchange controls;•withholding taxes and restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings;•labor regulations;•expropriations of property;•the potential instability of foreign governments;•risks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities;•export and import restrictions; and•other changes in laws or government policies.The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable. Certain regions, including Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa, are inherently more economically and politically volatile and as a result, our business units that operate in these regions could be subject to significant fluctuations in sales and operating income from quarter to quarter. Because a significant percentage of our operating income in recent years has come from these regions, adverse fluctuations in the operating results in these regions could have a disproportionate impact on our results of operations in future periods.For example, the European sovereign debt crisis has negatively affected economic conditions in Europe and globally. Our EMEA segment contributed 33% of our net sales and 20% of our total segment operating income in 2012.  If the European sovereign debt crisis continues or deepens, economic conditions in Europe may further deteriorate. In that case, our business in Europe and elsewhere, as well as the businesses of our customers and suppliers, may be adversely affected.As a further example, since 2003, Venezuela has imposed currency exchange controls that fix the exchange rate between the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte and the U.S. dollar and restrict the ability to exchange bolivares fuertes for dollars. These restrictions have delayed and limited our ability to pay third-party and affiliated suppliers and to otherwise repatriate funds from Venezuela, and may continue to do so, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. In addition, if we are unable to pay these suppliers in a timely manner, they may cease supplying us. Venezuela has also imposed restrictions on the importation of certain raw materials. If these suppliers cease supplying us or we are unable to import necessary raw materials, we may need to reduce or halt production in Venezuela, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.We have material bolivar fuerte-denominated net monetary assets and liabilities in Venezuela, the value of which will be correspondingly reduced in the event of a devaluation of the bolivar fuerte by the Venezuelan government.The future results of our Venezuelan operations will be affected by many factors, including actions by the Venezuelan government such as further currency devaluations, economic conditions in Venezuela such as inflation and consumer spending, and the availability of raw materials, utilities and energy. Goodyear Venezuela contributes a significant portion of the sales and operating income of our Latin American Tire segment. As a result, any disruption of Goodyear Venezuela’s operations or of our ability to pay suppliers or repatriate funds from Venezuela could have a material adverse impact on the future performance of our Latin American Tire segment and could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions.  These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export laws, anti-competition laws, anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, data privacy requirements, tax laws, and 15Table of Contentsaccounting, internal control and disclosure requirements.  Violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations.  In certain foreign jurisdictions, there is a higher risk of fraud or corruption and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls and compliance programs.  Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws and regulations.We have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.The financial position and results of operations of many of our international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on our reported sales and operating margin (and conversely, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies has a positive impact). For the year ended December 31, 2012, foreign currency translation unfavorably affected sales by $766 million and unfavorably affected segment operating income by $34 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. The volatility of currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results.We have material euro-denominated net monetary assets and liabilities.  If the European sovereign debt crisis leads to a significant devaluation of the euro, the value of our euro-denominated net monetary assets and liabilities would be correspondingly reduced when translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our financial statements.  Similarly, the re-introduction of certain individual country currencies or the complete dissolution of the euro, could adversely affect the value of our euro-denominated net monetary assets and liabilities. In either case, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.Certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, which would require us to use more of our available cash to service our indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into swap agreements or other hedging arrangements in the future, or that existing or future hedging arrangements will offset increases in interest rates. As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately $1.9 billion of variable rate debt outstanding.We have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales.We operate with significant operating and financial leverage. Significant portions of our manufacturing, selling, administrative and general expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with sales. In addition, a significant portion of our interest expense is fixed. There can be no assurance that we would be able to reduce our fixed costs proportionately in response to a decline in our net sales and therefore our competitiveness could be significantly impacted. As a result, a decline in our net sales would result in a higher percentage decline in our income from operations and net income.We may incur significant costs in connection with our contingent liabilities and tax matters.We have significant reserves for contingent liabilities and tax matters.  The major categories of our contingent liabilities include workers' compensation, product liability and other tort claims, including asbestos claims, and environmental matters.Our recorded liabilities and estimates of reasonably possible losses for our contingent liabilities are based on our assessment of potential liability using the information available to us at the time and, where applicable, any past experience and recent and current trends with respect to similar matters.  Our contingent liabilities are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable judicial or administrative decisions could occur which we did not anticipate.  Such an unfavorable decision could include monetary damages, fines or other penalties or an injunction prohibiting us from taking certain actions or selling certain products.  If such an unfavorable decision were to occur, it could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations in the period in which the decision occurs, or in future periods.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations, including with respect to transfer pricing.  While we apply consistent transfer pricing policies and practices globally, support transfer prices through economic studies, seek advance pricing agreements and joint audits to the extent possible and believe our transfer prices to be appropriate, such transfer prices, and related interpretations of tax laws, are occasionally challenged by various taxing 16Table of Contentsauthorities globally.  We have received various tax assessments challenging our interpretations of applicable tax laws in various jurisdictions.  Although we believe we have complied with applicable tax laws, have strong positions and defenses and have historically been successful in defending such claims, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in the case we are unsuccessful in the defense of existing or future claims.For further information regarding our contingent liabilities and tax matters, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements, No. 18, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. For further information regarding our accounting policies with respect to certain of our contingent liabilities and uncertain income tax positions, refer to “Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies.”We may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral if we are subject to a significant adverse judgment or if we are unable to obtain surety bonds, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.We are subject to various legal proceedings. If we wish to appeal any future adverse judgment in any of these proceedings, we may be required to post an appeal bond with the relevant court. In that case, we may be required to issue a letter of credit to the surety posting the bond. We may issue up to an aggregate of $800 million in letters of credit under our $2.0 billion U.S. senior secured first lien credit facility. As of December 31, 2012, we had $400 million in letters of credit issued and $1,239 million of remaining availability under this facility. If we are subject to a significant adverse judgment and do not have sufficient availability under our credit facilities to issue a letter of credit to support an appeal bond, we may be required to pay down borrowings under the facilities or deposit cash collateral in order to stay the enforcement of the judgment pending an appeal. If we are unable to post cash collateral, we may be unable to stay enforcement of the judgment.Under standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue or continue bonds on a case-by-case basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of collateral as a condition to issuing or renewing any bonds. If surety providers were to limit or eliminate our access to bonding, we would need to post other forms of collateral, such as letters of credit or cash. As described above, we may be unable to secure sufficient letters of credit under our credit facilities.If we were subject to a significant adverse judgment or experienced an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity, we may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.We are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating results.We are subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, which has established various standards and regulations applicable to tires sold in the United States and tires sold in a foreign country that are identical or substantially similar to tires sold in the United States. NHTSA has the authority to order the recall of automotive products, including tires, having safety-related defects.The Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation Act, or TREAD Act, imposes numerous requirements with respect to the early warning reporting of warranty claims, property damage claims, and bodily injury and fatality claims and also requires tire manufacturers, among other things, to comply with revised and more rigorous tire testing standards. Compliance with the TREAD Act regulations has increased the cost of producing and distributing tires in the United States. In addition, while we believe that our tires are free from design and manufacturing defects, it is possible that a recall of our tires, under the TREAD Act or otherwise, could occur in the future. A substantial recall could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and financial position.In addition, as required by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, NHTSA will establish a national tire fuel efficiency consumer information program. When the related rule-making process is completed, certain tires sold in the United States will be required to be rated for rolling resistance, traction and tread wear. While the Federal law will preempt state tire fuel efficiency laws adopted after January 1, 2006, we may become subject to additional tire fuel efficiency legislation, either in the United States or other countries.Our European operations are subject to regulation by the European Union. In 2009, two important regulations, the Tire Safety Regulation and the Tire Labeling Regulation, applicable to tires sold in the European Union were adopted. The Tire Safety Regulation sets performance standards that tires for cars and light and commercial trucks need to meet for rolling resistance, wet grip braking (passenger car only) and noise in order to be sold in the European Union, and became effective beginning in 2012, with continuing phases that will become effective through 2020. The Tire Labeling Regulation applies to all passenger car, light truck and commercial truck tires produced after July 1, 2012 and requires, after November 1, 2012, that consumers be informed about the tire's fuel efficiency, wet grip and noise characteristics. Other countries, such as Brazil, have also adopted tire labeling regulations, and additional countries may also introduce similar regulations in the future.Tires produced or sold in Europe also have to comply with various other standards, including environmental laws such as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemical Substances), which regulates the use of chemicals in the 17Table of ContentsEuropean Union. For example, since January 1, 2010, REACH has prohibited the use of highly aromatic oils in tires, which were used as compounding components to improve certain performance characteristics.These U.S. and European regulations, rules adopted to implement these regulations, or other similar regulations that may be adopted in the United States, Europe or elsewhere in the future may require us to alter or increase our capital spending and research and development plans or cease the production of certain tires, which could have a material adverse affect on our operating results.Laws and regulations governing environmental and occupational safety and health are complicated, change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time. As a manufacturing company, we are subject to these laws and regulations both inside and outside the United States. We may not be in complete compliance with such laws and regulations at all times. Our costs or liabilities relating to them may be more than the amount we have reserved, and that difference may be material.In addition, our manufacturing facilities may become subject to further limitations on the emission of “greenhouse gases” due to public policy concerns regarding climate change issues or other environmental or health and safety concerns. While the form of any additional regulations cannot be predicted, a “cap-and-trade” system similar to the one adopted in the European Union could be adopted in the United States. Any such “cap-and-trade” system (including the system currently in place in the European Union) or other limitations imposed on the emission of “greenhouse gases” could require us to increase our capital expenditures, use our cash to acquire emission credits or restructure our manufacturing operations, which could have a material adverse affect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.Compliance with the laws and regulations described above or any of the myriad of applicable foreign, Federal, state and local laws and regulations currently in effect or that may be adopted in the future could materially adversely affect our competitive position, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.The terms and conditions of our global alliance with Sumitomo Rubber Industries, Ltd. provide for exit rights available to SRI upon the occurrence of certain events, which could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire SRI’s interest in our European and North American joint ventures.Under the global alliance agreements between us and SRI, SRI has the right to require us to purchase its ownership interests in GDTE and GDTNA if certain triggering events have occurred, including certain bankruptcy events, changes in control of Goodyear or breaches of the global alliance agreements. Any payment required to be made to SRI pursuant to an exit under the terms of the global alliance agreements could be substantial. We cannot assure you that our operating performance, cash flow and capital resources would be sufficient to make such a payment or, if we were able to make the payment, that there would be sufficient funds remaining to satisfy our other obligations. The withdrawal of SRI from the global alliance could also have other adverse effects on our business, including the loss of purchasing synergies. For further information regarding our global alliance with SRI, including the events that could trigger SRI’s exit rights, see “Item 1. Business. Description of Goodyear’s Business — Global Alliance.”We may be adversely affected by any disruption in, or failure of, our information technology systems.We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology, or IT, systems across all of our major business functions, including our research and development, manufacturing, retail, financial and administrative functions.  We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing upgrades when necessary.  Our security measures are focused on the prevention, detection and remediation of damage from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber attack and other similar disruptions.  We may incur significant costs in order to implement the security measures that we feel are necessary to protect our IT systems.  However, our IT systems may remain vulnerable to damage despite our implementation of security measures that we deem to be appropriate.Any system failure, accident or security breach involving our IT systems could result in disruptions to our operations.  A material breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets, negatively impact our manufacturing or retail operations, or result in the compromise of personal information of our employees, customers or suppliers.  To the extent that any system failure, accident or security breach results in disruptions to our operations or the theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our data or confidential information, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially adversely affected.Our business substantially depends on the continued service of key members of our management. The loss of the services of a significant number of members of our management could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, such as engineering, marketing and senior management professionals. Competition for these employees is intense, and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting new high quality employees, our business could be materially adversely affected.18Table of ContentsWe may be impacted by economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters.We manage businesses and facilities worldwide. Our facilities and operations, and the facilities and operations of our suppliers and customers, could be disrupted by events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters. Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales and customers. We may not be insured against all such potential losses and, if insured, the insurance proceeds that we receive may not adequately compensate us for all of our losses"
7,GT,GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER CO,2012-02-14,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS.You should carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when considering an investment decision with respect to our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If they do, our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be materially adversely affected. In such an instance, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment.If we do not achieve projected savings from our cost reduction initiatives or successfully implement other strategic initiatives our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected. Our business continues to be impacted by trends that have negatively affected the tire industry in general, as the economic recovery in developed markets was impacted by uncertainty surrounding debt issues in Europe and the United States and continued high levels of unemployment.  These negative trends include volatile raw material costs, rising energy costs, wage inflation in emerging markets, and continued pressure from our unfunded pension obligations.  In addition, global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict. If these overall trends continue or worsen, then our operational and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Unlike most other tire manufacturers, we also face the continuing burden of significant legacy pension costs.In order to offset the impact of these trends, we continue to implement various cost reduction initiatives and expect to achieve $1.0 billion in aggregate gross cost savings from 2010 through 2012 through our cost savings plan, which includes expected savings from continuous improvement initiatives, including savings under our USW agreement, increased low-cost country sourcing, high-cost capacity reductions, initiatives to reduce raw material costs and reduced selling, administrative and general expenses.  As of December 31, 2011, we have realized approximately $750 million of cost savings under this three-year plan.We have announced other important strategic initiatives, such as increasing our low-cost manufacturing capacity, reducing our high-cost manufacturing capacity, such as our plan to close one of our facilities in Amiens, France, and increasing sales in emerging markets. We are also undertaking significant capital investments in new, expanded and modernized manufacturing facilities around the world. The failure to implement successfully our important strategic initiatives may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.Our performance is also dependent on our ability to continue to improve the proportion, or mix, of higher margin tires we sell. In order to continue this improvement, we must be successful in marketing and selling products that offer higher margins such as the Assurance, Fuel Max, Eagle and Fortera lines of tires and in developing additional higher margin tires that achieve broad market acceptance. Shifts in consumer demand away from higher margin tires could materially adversely affect our business.We cannot assure you that our cost reduction and other initiatives will be successful. If not, we may not be able to achieve or sustain future profitability, which would impair our ability to meet our debt and other obligations and would otherwise negatively affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.Higher raw material and energy costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Raw material costs increased significantly over the past few years, and may continue to do so, driven by increases in prices of natural rubber and petrochemical-based commodities. Market conditions or contractual obligations may prevent us from passing these increased costs on to our customers through timely price increases. Additionally, higher raw material costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. As a result, higher raw material and energy costs could result in declining margins and operating results and adversely affect our financial condition. The volatility of raw material costs may cause our margins, operating results and liquidity to fluctuate.Our pension plans are significantly underfunded and, in the future, the underfunding levels of our pension plans and our pension expense could materially increase.Although we have frozen a number of our pension plans globally, including our U.S. salaried pension plans, and closed participation in our primary U.S. hourly pension plan, many of our employees participate in, and many of our former employees are entitled to benefits under, defined benefit pension plans. Over time, we have experienced periods of declines in interest rates and pension asset values. As a result, our pension plans are significantly underfunded. Further declines in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plans, or certain other changes, could materially increase the underfunded status of our plans in 2012 and beyond and affect the level and timing of required contributions in 2013 and beyond. The unfunded amount of the projected benefit obligation for our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans was $2,452 million and $645 million, respectively, at December 31, 2011, and we currently estimate that we will be required to make contributions to our funded U.S. pension plans of approximately $425 million to $450 million in 2012, and $425 million to $475 million in 2013. The current underfunded status of our pension 11Table of Contentsplans will, and a further material increase in the underfunded status of the plans would, significantly increase our required contributions and pension expense, which could impair our ability to achieve or sustain future profitability and adversely affect our financial condition.We face significant global competition and our market share could decline.New tires are sold under highly competitive conditions throughout the world. We compete with other tire manufacturers on the basis of product design, performance, price and terms, reputation, warranty terms, customer service and consumer convenience. On a worldwide basis, we have two major competitors, Bridgestone (based in Japan) and Michelin (based in France), that have large shares of the markets of the countries in which they are based and are aggressively seeking to maintain or improve their worldwide market share. Other significant competitors include Continental, Cooper, Hankook, Kumho, Pirelli, Toyo, Yokohama and various regional tire manufacturers. Our competitors produce significant numbers of tires in low-cost countries, and have announced plans to further increase their production capacity in low-cost countries. In Brazil in 2011, we faced competition from increased imports of tires from Asia, which contributed to the year over year decline in Latin American Tire's segment operating income.  We may face further competitive pressures in Brazil and other key countries that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in significant part, on our ability to continue to innovate and manufacture the types of tires demanded by consumers, and to reduce costs by such means as reducing excess and high-cost capacity, leveraging global purchasing, improving productivity, eliminating redundancies and increasing production at low-cost supply sources. If we are unable to compete successfully, our market share may decline, materially adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition.Our long term ability to meet our obligations and to repay maturing indebtedness may be dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results.The adequacy of our liquidity depends on our ability to achieve an appropriate combination of operating improvements, financing from third parties and access to capital markets. We may need to undertake additional financing actions in the capital markets in order to ensure that our future liquidity requirements are addressed. These actions may include the issuance of additional debt or equity.Our access to the capital markets cannot be assured and is dependent on, among other things, the ability and willingness of financial institutions to extend credit on terms that are acceptable to us, or to honor future draws on our existing lines of credit, and the degree of success we have in implementing our cost reduction plans and improving the results of our North American Tire segment. Concerns regarding the effect of the European sovereign debt crisis on financial institutions in Europe and elsewhere could have an adverse impact on the European and global capital markets and on our ability to access those markets to finance our European business or our business globally. Future liquidity requirements, or our inability to access cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit, also may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. A substantial portion of our assets is subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness.Our inability to access the capital markets or incur additional debt in the future could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations, and could require us to consider further measures, including deferring planned capital expenditures, reducing discretionary spending, selling additional assets and restructuring existing debt.Financial difficulties, work stoppages, supply disruptions or economic conditions affecting our major OE customers, dealers or suppliers could harm our business.The economic recovery in developed markets has been negatively impacted by uncertainty surrounding debt issues in Europe and the United States and continued high levels of unemployment.  In emerging markets, high inflation and interest rates also contributed to uneven industry conditions.  As a result of these economic conditions, our tire unit shipments in 2011 were essentially flat compared to 2010, and automotive vehicle production and global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict.Although sales to our OE customers account for less than 20% of our net sales, demand for our products by OE customers and production levels at our facilities are impacted by automotive vehicle production. We may experience future declines in sales volume due to declines in new vehicle sales, the discontinuation or sale of certain OE brands, platforms or programs, or weakness in the demand for replacement tires, which could result in us incurring under-absorbed fixed costs at our production facilities or slowing the rate at which we are able to recover those costs.12Table of ContentsAutomotive production can also be affected by labor relation issues, financial difficulties or supply disruptions. Our OE customers could experience production disruptions resulting from their own or supplier labor, financial or supply difficulties. Such events may cause an OE customer to reduce or suspend vehicle production. As a result, an OE customer could halt or significantly reduce purchases of our products, which would harm our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.In addition, the bankruptcy, restructuring or consolidation of one or more of our major OE customers, dealers or suppliers could result in the write-off of accounts receivable, a reduction in purchases of our products or a supply disruption to our facilities, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost-effective manner.Our capital expenditures are limited by our liquidity and capital resources and the amount we have available for capital spending is limited by the need to pay our other expenses and to maintain adequate cash reserves and borrowing capacity to meet unexpected demands that may arise. We believe that our ratio of capital expenditures to sales is lower than the comparable ratio for our principal competitors.Productivity improvements through process re-engineering, design efficiency and manufacturing cost improvements may be required to offset potential increases in labor and raw material costs and competitive price pressures. In addition, as part of our strategy to increase the percentage of tires that are produced at our lower-cost production facilities and to increase our capacity to produce higher margin tires, we may need to modernize or expand our facilities. For example, we are making a significant investment in a new manufacturing facility in Pulandian, China, which began tire production in 2011.  We are also currently undertaking significant expansion and modernization projects at our manufacturing facilities in Santiago, Chile; Americana, Brazil; Lawton, Oklahoma; Riesa, Germany; Fayetteville, North Carolina; and throughout EMEA in connection with new European tire labeling requirements. We may not have sufficient resources to implement planned capital expenditures with minimal disruption to our existing manufacturing operations, or within desired time frames and budgets. Any disruption to our operations, delay in implementing capital improvements or unexpected costs may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.If we are unable to make sufficient capital expenditures, or to maximize the efficiency of the capital expenditures we do make, we may be unable to achieve productivity improvements, which may harm our competitive position. In addition, plant modernizations may temporarily disrupt our manufacturing operations and lead to temporary increases in our costs.If we fail to extend or renegotiate our primary collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions as they expire from time to time, or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.We are a party to collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions, which represent a significant number of our employees. Approximately 11,000 of our employees outside of the United States are covered by union contracts that have expired or are expiring in 2012, primarily in Luxembourg, France and Poland. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory, no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time to time. If we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements, if disputes with our unions arise, or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, we could experience a significant disruption of, or inefficiencies in, our operations or incur higher labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity.13Table of ContentsWe have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health.We have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 31, 2011, our debt (including capital leases) on a consolidated basis was approximately $5.2 billion. Our substantial amount of debt and other obligations could have important consequences. For example, it could:•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;•impair our ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, acquisitions or general corporate requirements;•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we would need to dedicate a substantial portion of these funds for payments on our indebtedness;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.The agreements governing our debt, including our credit agreements, limit, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional debt and we may incur a significant amount of additional debt in the future, including additional secured debt. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, our ability to satisfy our debt obligations may become more limited.Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt and other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to our ability to implement our cost reduction initiatives and other strategies, prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, including required pension contributions, we may be forced to reduce or delay expansion plans and capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that our operating performance, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient to pay our debt obligations when they become due. We cannot assure you that we would be able to dispose of material assets or operations or restructure our debt or other obligations if necessary or, even if we were able to take such actions, that we could do so on terms that are acceptable to us.Any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our debt instruments, or a material reduction in the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations.The indentures and other agreements governing our secured credit facilities, senior unsecured notes and our other outstanding indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things:•incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock;•pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments or investments;•incur liens;•sell assets;•incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us;•enter into affiliate transactions;•engage in sale/leaseback transactions; and•engage in certain mergers or consolidations or transfers of substantially all of our assets.Availability under our first lien revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and inventory decline, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under that facility may decrease below its stated amount. In addition, if at any time the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under that facility exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to prepay borrowings and/or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess.Our ability to comply with these covenants or to maintain our borrowing base may be affected by events beyond our control, including deteriorating economic conditions, and these events could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures. We cannot assure you that such waivers, amendments or alternative financing could be obtained, or if obtained, would be on terms acceptable to us.A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in any of our existing or future financing agreements, including the financial covenants in our secured credit facilities, could result in an event of default under those agreements. Such a default could allow the lenders under our financing agreements, if the agreements so provide, to discontinue lending, to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, and/or to declare all borrowings 14Table of Contentsoutstanding thereunder to be due and payable. In addition, the lenders could terminate any commitments they have to provide us with further funds. If any of these events occur, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available to pay in full the total amount of obligations that become due as a result of any such acceleration, or that we will be able to find additional or alternative financing to refinance any such accelerated obligations. Even if we obtain additional or alternative financing, we cannot assure you that it would be on terms that would be acceptable to us.We cannot assure you that we will be able to remain in compliance with the covenants to which we are subject in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from our lenders or amend the covenants.Our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.We have manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the world. Our international operations are subject to certain inherent risks, including:•exposure to local economic conditions;•adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States;•hostility from local populations and insurrections;•adverse currency exchange controls;•withholding taxes and restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings;•labor regulations;•expropriations of property;•the potential instability of foreign governments;•risks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities;•export and import restrictions; and•other changes in laws or government policies.The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable. Certain regions, including Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa, are inherently more economically and politically volatile and as a result, our business units that operate in these regions could be subject to significant fluctuations in sales and operating income from quarter to quarter. Because a significant percentage of our operating income in recent years has come from these regions, adverse fluctuations in the operating results in these regions could have a disproportionate impact on our results of operations in future periods.         For example, the European sovereign debt crisis has negatively affected economic conditions in Europe and globally. Our EMEA segment contributed 35% of our net sales and 46% of our total segment operating income in 2011.  If the European sovereign debt crisis continues or deepens, economic conditions in Europe may further deteriorate. In that case, our business in Europe and elsewhere, as well as the businesses of our customers and suppliers, may be adversely affected.As a further example, since 2003, Venezuela has imposed currency exchange controls that fix the exchange rate between the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte and the U.S. dollar and restrict the ability to exchange bolivares fuertes for dollars. These restrictions have delayed and limited our ability to pay third-party and affiliated suppliers and to otherwise repatriate funds from Venezuela, and may continue to do so, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. In addition, if we are unable to pay these suppliers in a timely manner, they may cease supplying us. Venezuela has also imposed restrictions on the importation of certain raw materials. If these suppliers cease supplying us or we are unable to import necessary raw materials, we may need to reduce or halt production in Venezuela, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.The future results of our Venezuelan operations will be affected by many factors, including actions by the Venezuelan government such as further currency devaluations, economic conditions in Venezuela such as inflation and consumer spending, and the availability of raw materials, utilities and energy. Goodyear Venezuela contributes a significant portion of the sales and operating income of our Latin American Tire segment. As a result, any disruption of Goodyear Venezuela’s operations or of our ability to pay suppliers or repatriate funds from Venezuela could have a material adverse impact on the future performance of our Latin American Tire segment and could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.         In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions.  These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export laws, anti-competition laws, anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, data privacy requirements, tax laws, and accounting, internal control and disclosure requirements.  Violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations.  In certain foreign jurisdictions, there is a higher risk of fraud or corruption and greater difficulty in maintaining 15Table of Contentseffective internal controls and compliance programs.  Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws and regulations.We have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.The financial position and results of operations of our international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on our reported sales and operating margin (and conversely, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies has a positive impact). For the year ended December 31, 2011, foreign currency translation favorably affected sales by $599 million and favorably affected segment operating income by $57 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The volatility of currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results.        We have material euro-denominated net monetary assets and liabilities.  If the European sovereign debt crisis leads to a significant devaluation of the euro, the value of our euro-denominated net monetary assets and liabilities would be correspondingly reduced when translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our financial statements.  Similarly, the re-introduction of certain individual country currencies or the complete dissolution of the euro, could adversely affect the value of our euro-denominated net monetary assets and liabilities. In either case, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.Certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, which would require us to use more of our available cash to service our indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into swap agreements or other hedging arrangements in the future, or that existing or future hedging arrangements will offset increases in interest rates. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $2.2 billion of variable rate debt outstanding.We have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales.We operate with significant operating and financial leverage. Significant portions of our manufacturing, selling, administrative and general expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with sales. In addition, a significant portion of our interest expense is fixed. There can be no assurance that we would be able to reduce our fixed costs proportionately in response to a decline in our net sales and therefore our competitiveness could be significantly impacted. As a result, a decline in our net sales would result in a higher percentage decline in our income from operations and net income.We may incur significant costs in connection with asbestos claims.We are among many defendants named in legal proceedings involving claims of individuals relating to alleged exposure to asbestos. At December 31, 2011, approximately 78,500 claims were pending against us alleging various asbestos-related personal injuries purported to have resulted from alleged exposure to asbestos in certain rubber encapsulated products or aircraft braking systems manufactured by us in the past or to asbestos in certain of our facilities. We expect that additional claims will be brought against us in the future. Our ultimate liability with respect to such pending and unasserted claims is subject to various uncertainties, including the following:•the number of claims that are brought in the future;•the costs of defending and settling these claims;•the risk of insolvencies among our insurance carriers;•the possibility that adverse jury verdicts could require us to pay damages in amounts greater than the amounts for which we have historically settled claims;•the risk of changes in the litigation environment or Federal and state law governing the compensation of asbestos claimants; and•the risk that the bankruptcies of other asbestos defendants may increase our costs.16Table of ContentsBecause of the uncertainties related to such claims, it is possible that we may incur a material amount of cost in excess of our current reserve for such claims. In addition, if any of the foregoing risks were to materialize, the resulting costs could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial position and results of operations in future periods. For further information regarding our asbestos liabilities, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements, No. 19, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.We may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral if we are subject to a significant adverse judgment or if we are unable to obtain surety bonds, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.We are subject to various legal proceedings. If we wish to appeal any future adverse judgment in any of these proceedings, we may be required to post an appeal bond with the relevant court. In that case, we may be required to issue a letter of credit to the surety posting the bond. We may issue up to an aggregate of $800 million in letters of credit under our $1.5 billion U.S. senior secured first lien credit facility. As of December 31, 2011, we had $407 million in letters of credit issued and $1,093 million of remaining availability under this facility. If we are subject to a significant adverse judgment and do not have sufficient availability under our credit facilities to issue a letter of credit to support an appeal bond, we may be required to pay down borrowings under the facilities or deposit cash collateral in order to stay the enforcement of the judgment pending an appeal. If we are unable to post cash collateral, we may be unable to stay enforcement of the judgment.Under standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue or continue bonds on a case-by-case basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of collateral as a condition to issuing or renewing any bonds. If surety providers were to limit or eliminate our access to bonding, we would need to post other forms of collateral, such as letters of credit or cash. As described above, we may be unable to secure sufficient letters of credit under our credit facilities.If we were subject to a significant adverse judgment or experienced an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity, we may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.We are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating results.We are subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, which has established various standards and regulations applicable to tires sold in the United States and tires sold in a foreign country that are identical or substantially similar to tires sold in the United States. NHTSA has the authority to order the recall of automotive products, including tires, having safety-related defects.The Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation Act, or TREAD Act, imposes numerous requirements with respect to the early warning reporting of warranty claims, property damage claims, and bodily injury and fatality claims and also requires tire manufacturers, among other things, to conform with revised and more rigorous tire testing standards. Compliance with the TREAD Act regulations has increased the cost of producing and distributing tires in the United States. In addition, while we believe that our tires are free from design and manufacturing defects, it is possible that a recall of our tires, under the TREAD Act or otherwise, could occur in the future. A substantial recall could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and financial position.In addition, as required by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, NHTSA will establish a national tire fuel efficiency consumer information program. When the related rule-making process is completed, certain tires sold in the United States will be required to be rated for rolling resistance, traction and tread wear. While the Federal law will preempt state tire fuel efficiency laws adopted after January 1, 2006, we may become subject to additional tire fuel efficiency legislation, either in the United States or other countries.Our European operations are subject to regulation by the European Union. In 2009, two important regulations, the Tire Safety Regulation and the Tire Labeling Regulation, applicable to tires sold in the European Union were adopted. The Tire Safety Regulation sets performance standards that tires for cars and light and commercial trucks need to meet for rolling resistance, wet grip braking and noise in order to be sold in the European Union, and will become effective between 2012 and 2020. The Tire Labeling Regulation applies to all car and light and commercial truck tires produced after June 30, 2012 and requires that tires be labeled to inform consumers about the tire’s fuel efficiency, wet grip and noise characteristics. Tires produced or sold in Europe also have to comply with various other standards, including environmental laws such as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemical substances), which regulates the use of chemicals in the European Union. For example, since January 1, 2010, REACH has prohibited the use of highly aromatic oils in tires, which were used as compounding components to improve certain safety-related performance characteristics, such as grip.17Table of ContentsThese U.S. and European regulations, rules adopted to implement these regulations, or other similar regulations that may be adopted in the United States, Europe or elsewhere in the future may require us to alter or increase our capital spending and research and development plans or cease the production of certain tires, which could have a material adverse affect on our operating results.Laws and regulations governing environmental and occupational safety and health are complicated, change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time. As a manufacturing company, we are subject to these laws and regulations both inside and outside the United States. We may not be in complete compliance with such laws and regulations at all times. Our costs or liabilities relating to them may be more than the amount we have reserved, and that difference may be material.In addition, our manufacturing facilities may become subject to further limitations on the emission of “greenhouse gases” due to public policy concerns regarding climate change issues or other environmental or health and safety concerns. While the form of any additional regulations cannot be predicted, a “cap-and-trade” system similar to the one adopted in the European Union could be adopted in the United States. Any such “cap-and-trade” system (including the system currently in place in the European Union) or other limitations imposed on the emission of “greenhouse gases” could require us to increase our capital expenditures, use our cash to acquire emission credits or restructure our manufacturing operations, which could have a material adverse affect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.Compliance with the laws and regulations described above or any of the myriad of applicable foreign, Federal, state and local laws and regulations currently in effect or that may be adopted in the future could materially adversely affect our competitive position, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.The terms and conditions of our global alliance with Sumitomo Rubber Industries, Ltd. provide for exit rights available to SRI upon the occurrence of certain events, which could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire SRI’s interest in our European and North American joint ventures.Under the global alliance agreements between us and SRI, SRI has the right to require us to purchase its ownership interests in GDTE and GDTNA if certain triggering events have occurred, including certain bankruptcy events, changes in control of Goodyear or breaches of the global alliance agreements. While we have not done any current valuation of these businesses, any payment required to be made to SRI pursuant to an exit under the terms of the global alliance agreements could be substantial. We cannot assure you that our operating performance, cash flow and capital resources would be sufficient to make such a payment or, if we were able to make the payment, that there would be sufficient funds remaining to satisfy our other obligations. The withdrawal of SRI from the global alliance could also have other adverse effects on our business, including the loss of technology and purchasing synergies. For further information regarding our global alliance with SRI, including the events that could trigger SRI’s exit rights, see “Item 1. Business. Description of Goodyear’s Business — Global Alliance.”We may be adversely affected by any disruption in, or failure of, our information technology systems.We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology, or IT, systems across all of our major business functions, including our research and development, manufacturing, retail, financial and administrative functions.  We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing upgrades when necessary.  Our security measures are focused on the prevention, detection and remediation of damage from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber attack and other similar disruptions.  We may incur significant costs in order to implement the security measures that we feel are necessary to protect our IT systems.  However, our IT systems may remain vulnerable to damage despite our implementation of security measures that we deem to be appropriate.Any system failure, accident or security breach involving our IT systems could result in disruptions to our operations.  A material breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets, negatively impact our manufacturing or retail operations, or result in the compromise of personal information of our employees, customers or suppliers.  To the extent that any system failure, accident or security breach results in disruptions to our operations or the theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our data or confidential information, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially adversely affected.Our business substantially depends on the continued service of key members of our management. The loss of the services of a significant number of members of our management could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, such as engineering, marketing and senior management professionals. Competition for these employees is intense, and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting new high quality employees, our business could be materially adversely affected.18Table of ContentsWe may be impacted by economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters.We manage businesses and facilities worldwide. Our facilities and operations, and the facilities and operations of our suppliers and customers, could be disrupted by events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters. Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales and customers. We may not be insured against all such potential losses and, if insured, the insurance proceeds that we receive may not adequately compensate us for all of our losses"
2,GT,GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER CO,2006-02-17,"ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORS.     You should carefully consider the risks described below andother information contained in this Annual Report onForm 10-K whenconsidering an investment decision with respect to oursecurities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presentlyknown to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may alsoimpair our business operations. Any of the events discussed inthe risk factors below may occur. If they do, our business,results of operations or financial condition could be materiallyadversely affected. In such an instance, the trading price ofour securities could decline, and you might lose all or part ofyour investment.It is uncertain whether we will successfully implement the    turnaround strategy for our North American Tire segment.We are in the process of implementing a turnaround strategy forour North American Tire Segment. Based in part on successes inimplementing this strategy, North American Tire had positivesegment operating income in 2004 and 2005, after recordingoperating losses in the previous two years. Additional progressin implementing the turnaround strategy is needed, however, toenable the North American Tire business segment to continue toachieve and maintain profitability.     The ability of the North American Tire Segment to achieve andmaintain profitability may be hampered by trends that continueto negatively affect the business, including industryovercapacity, which limits pricing power, increased competitionfrom low-cost manufacturers and uncertain economic conditions inthe United States. In addition, our North American Tire Segmenthas been, and may continue to be negatively affected by higherthan expected raw materials and energy costs, weakness in thedomestic auto industry, as well as the continuing burden oflegacy pension and postretirement benefit costs. The success ofour turnaround strategy is dependent, in part, on our ability toaddress and manage these costs as well as the costs associatedwith operating our manufacturing facilities in North America andto implement productivity improvements in these facilities.     The success of the turnaround strategy is also dependent onNorth American Tires ability to continue to improve theproportion, or mix, of higher margin tires it sells. In order tocontinue this improvement, North American Tire must besuccessful in marketing and selling products that offer highermargins such as the Assurance and Fortera lines of tires and indeveloping additional higher margin tires that achieve broadmarket acceptance. Other initiatives that may impact ourturnaround effort include our ability to successfully expandinto the truck service business and to continue our selectivefitment strategy with our OE customers.     We cannot assure that our turnaround strategy will besuccessful. If our turnaround strategy is not successful, we maynot be able to achieve or sustain future profitability, whichwould impair our ability to meet our debt and other obligationsand would otherwise negatively affect our financial conditionand operations.11Table of ContentsWe face significant global competition and our market    share could decline.New tires are sold under highly competitive conditionsthroughout the world. We compete with other tire manufacturerson the basis of product design, performance, price, reputation,warranty terms, customer service and consumer convenience. On aworldwide basis, we have two major competitors, Bridgestone(based in Japan) and Michelin (based in France), that dominatethe markets of the countries in which they are based and areaggressively seeking to maintain or improve their respectiveshares of the North American, European, Latin American and otherworld tire markets. Other significant competitors includeContinental, Cooper Tire, Pirelli, Toyo, Yokohama, Kumho,Hankook and various regional tire manufacturers. Our competitorsproduce significant numbers of tires in low-cost markets. We arelimited by our master contract with the United Steelworkers(USW) in our ability to shift production of certainproducts from U.S. facilities to low-cost markets and ourcredit agreements limit the amount of capital expenditures wemay make. Our ability to compete successfully will depend, insignificant part, on our ability to reduce costs by such meansas reduction of excess capacity, leveraging global purchasing,improving productivity, elimination of redundancies andincreasing production at low-cost supply sources. If we areunable to compete successfully, our market share may decline,materially adversely affecting our results of operations andfinancial condition.Our pension plans are significantly underfunded and our    required contributions to these plans are expected to    increase.The unfunded amount of the projected benefit obligation for ourU.S. andnon-U.S. pensionplans was $2 billion and $1 billion atDecember 31, 2005, respectively. Our funding obligationsfor our U.S. plans are governed by the Employee RetirementIncome Security Act of 1974, or ERISA. In 2005, we met orexceeded our required funding obligations for these plans underERISA. Estimates of the amount and timing of our future fundingobligations are based on various assumptions. These includeassumptions concerning, among other things, the actual andprojected market performance of the pension plan assets;interest rates on long-term obligations; statutory requirements;and demographic data for pension plan participants. The amountand timing of our future funding obligations also depend onwhether we elect to make contributions to the pension plans inexcess of those required under ERISA, as such voluntarycontributions could reduce or defer our future fundingobligations.     At the end of 2005, interest rate relief measures relating tothe calculation of pension funding obligations expired. Sincenew legislation has not yet been enacted, the interest ratereverted to a 30-yearU.S. Treasury bond basis beginning in 2006 and we estimatethat we will be required to contribute approximately$700 million to $750 million to our domestic pensionplans in 2006 under this basis. If new legislation is enacted in2006, we expect that the interest rate used for 2006 will bebased on a corporate bond basis. Using an estimate of theserates would result in estimated required contributions to ourdomestic pension plans in 2006 of $550 million to$600 million. For more information on the calculation ofour estimated domestic pension plan contributions, seeManagements Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations  Commitments andContingent Liabilities. The anticipated fundingobligations under our pension plans for 2007 and thereaftercannot be reasonably estimated at this time because of thecurrent uncertainty around pension reform legislation. Pensionreform legislation before Congress would replace the interestrate used to calculate pension funding obligations starting in2007, require more rapid funding of underfunded plans, restrictthe use of techniques that reduce funding volatility, and limitpension increases in underfunded plans. In addition, Congresshas recently passed legislation increasing the insurancepremiums charged by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Itis not possible to predict whether Congress will adopt pensionreform legislation, or what form any final legislation mighttake. If legislation similar to the pending bills were enacted,it could materially increase our pension funding obligations andinsurance premiums, and could limit our ability to negotiatepension increases for our union-represented employees.Nevertheless, we presently expect that our funding obligationsunder our pension plans in 2007 and subsequent years will besubstantial and could have a material adverse impact on ourliquidity.12Table of ContentsHigher raw material and energy costs may materially    adversely affect our operating results and financial    condition.Raw material costs increased significantly over the past fewyears driven by increases in costs of oil and natural rubber.Market conditions may prevent us from passing these increasedcosts on to our customers through timely price increases.Additionally, higher raw material costs around the world maycontinue to hinder our ability to fully realize our turnaroundstrategy. As a result, higher raw material and energy costscould result in declining margins and operating results.Continued pricing pressures from vehicle manufacturers may    materially adversely affect our business.Approximately 28% of the tires we sell are sold to vehiclemanufacturers for mounting as OE. Pricing pressure from vehiclemanufacturers has been a characteristic of the tire industry inrecent years. Many vehicle manufacturers have policies ofseeking price reductions each year. Although we have taken stepsto reduce costs and resist price reductions, current and futureprice reductions could materially adversely impact our sales andprofit margins. If we are unable to offset continued pricereductions through improved operating efficiencies and reducedexpenditures, those price reductions may result in decliningmargins and operating results.If we fail to extend or renegotiate our primary collective    bargaining contracts with our labor unions as they expire from    time to time, or if our unionized employees were to engage in a    strike or other work stoppage, our business and operating    results could be materially adversely affected.We are a party to collective bargaining contracts with our laborunions, which represent a significant number of our employees.In particular, our master collective bargaining agreement withthe USW covers approximately 13,600 employees in the UnitedStates at December 31, 2005 and expires in July 2006.Although we believe that our relations with our employees aresatisfactory, no assurance can be given that we will be able tosuccessfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargainingagreements as they expire from time to time. If we fail toextend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements, ifdisputes with our unions arise, or if our unionized workersengage in a strike or other work stoppage, we could incur higherlabor costs or experience a significant disruption ofoperations, which could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial position and results of operations.Pending litigation relating to our 2003 restatement could    have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash    flows and results of operation.At least 36 lawsuits were filed against us and certain of ourcurrent or former officers or directors following our October2003 announcement regarding the restatement of our previouslyissued financial results. These actions have been consolidatedinto three separate actions in the United States District Courtfor the Northern District of Ohio. We intend to vigorouslydefend these lawsuits. However, we cannot currently predict ordetermine the outcome or resolution of these proceedings or thetiming for their resolution, or reasonably estimate the amount,or potential range, of possible loss, if any. In addition to anydamages that we may suffer, our managements efforts andattention may be diverted from our ordinary business operationsin order to address these claims. The final resolution of theselawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financialposition, cash flows and results of operation.An ongoing SEC investigation regarding our accounting    restatement could materially adversely affect us.Following our October 2003 announcement regarding therestatement of our previously issued financial results, the SECadvised us that it had initiated an informal inquiry into thefacts and circumstances related to the restatement. OnFebruary 5, 2004, the SEC advised us that it had approvedthe issuance of a formal order of investigation. OnAugust 16, 2005, we announced that we had received aWells Notice from the SEC indicating that the staffof the SEC intends to recommend that a civil or administrativeenforcement action be brought against us for alleged violationsof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, relating to themaintenance of books, records and internal accounting controls,the establishment of disclosure controls and procedures,13Table of Contentsand periodic SEC filing requirements. The alleged violationsrelate to the account reconciliation matters giving rise to ourinitial decision to restate in October 2003. We have also beeninformed that Wells Notices have been issued to a former chieffinancial officer and a former chief accounting officer of ours.We continue to cooperate with the SEC regarding this matter. Weare unable to predict the outcome of this process, and anunfavorable outcome could harm our reputation and our business.Our long-term ability to meet our obligations and to repay    maturing indebtedness is dependent on our ability to access    capital markets in the future and to improve our operating    results.The adequacy of our liquidity depends on our ability to achievean appropriate combination of operating improvements, financingfrom third parties, access to capital markets and asset sales.Although we completed a major refinancing of our senior securedcredit facilities on April 8, 2005, issued$400 million in Senior unsecured notes in June 2005, andrepaid our63/8%Euro Notes due 2005 upon maturity on June 6, 2005, we mayundertake additional financing actions in the capital markets inorder to ensure that our future liquidity requirements areaddressed. These actions may include the issuance of additionalequity.     Our access to the capital markets cannot be assured and isdependent on, among other things, the degree of success we haveimplementing our North American Tire turnaround strategy. See It is uncertain whether we will successfullyimplement the turnaround strategy for our North American Tiresegment. Future liquidity requirements also may make itnecessary for us to incur additional debt. A substantial portionof our assets is subject to liens securing our indebtedness. Asa result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remainingassets as security for additional secured indebtedness. Ourfailure to access the capital markets or incur additional debtin the future could have a material adverse effect on ourliquidity and operations, and could require us to considerfurther measures, including deferring planned capitalexpenditures, reducing discretionary spending, sellingadditional assets and restructuring existing debt.We have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict    our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise    materially adversely affect our financial health.We have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 31,2005, our debt (including capital leases) on a consolidatedbasis was approximately $5.4 billion. Our substantialamount of debt and other obligations could have importantconsequences. For example, it could:      Make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;      Impair our ability to obtain financing in the future for working    capital, capital expenditures, research and development,    acquisitions or general corporate requirements;      Increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and    industry conditions;      Limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of    our business because we would need to dedicate a substantial    portion of these funds for payments on our indebtedness;      Limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes    in our business and the industry in which we operate; and      Place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our    competitors that have less debt.The agreements governing our debt, including our creditagreements, limit, but do not prohibit, us from incurringadditional debt and we may incur a significant amount ofadditional debt in the future, including additional secureddebt. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, ourability to satisfy our debt obligations may become more limited.     Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, ourdebt and other obligations will depend on our financial andoperating performance, which, in turn, is subject to our abilityto implement our turnaround strategy, prevailing economicconditions and certain financial, business and other factorsbeyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources areinsufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations,including required pension contributions, we may be forced toreduce or delay expansion plans and capital expenditures, sellmaterial assets or operations, obtain additional capital orrestructure our debt. We cannot assure you that our operatingperformance, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficientto pay our debt obligations when they become due. We cannotassure you that we would be able to dispose of material assetsor operations or14Table of Contentsrestructure our debt or other obligations if necessary or, evenif we were able to take such actions, that we could do so onterms that were acceptable to us.Any failure to be in compliance with any material    provision or covenant of our debt instruments could have a    material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations.The indentures and other agreements governing our secured creditfacilities and secured notes and our other outstandingindebtedness impose significant operating and financialrestrictions on us. These restrictions may affect our ability tooperate our business and may limit our ability to take advantageof potential business opportunities as they arise. Theserestrictions limit our ability to, among other things:      Incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock;      Pay dividends and other distributions with respect to our    capital stock or repurchase our capital stock or make other    restricted payments;      Enter into transactions with affiliates;      Create or incur liens to secure debt;      Make certain investments;      Enter into sale/leaseback transactions;      Sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of assets;      Incur dividend or other payment restrictions affecting certain    subsidiaries;      Use proceeds from the sale of certain assets; and      Engage in certain mergers or consolidations and transfers of    substantially all assets.Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected byevents beyond our control, and unanticipated events couldrequire us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants oralternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures. Wecannot assure you that such waivers, amendments or alternativefinancing could be obtained, or if obtained, would be on termsacceptable to us.     Our first lien credit facility and European term loan andrevolving credit facility require us to maintain certainspecified thresholds of Consolidated EBITDA to ConsolidatedInterest Expense (as defined in each of the facilities). Inaddition, under these facilities, we are required not to permitour ratio of Consolidated Net Secured Indebtedness (net of cashin excess of $400 million) to Consolidated EBITDA to begreater than certain specified thresholds. These restrictionscould limit our ability to plan for or react to marketconditions or meet extraordinary capital needs or otherwiserestrict capital activities.     A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained inany of our existing or future financing agreements, includingthe financial covenants in our secured credit facilities, couldresult in an event of default under those agreements. Such adefault could allow the lenders under our financing agreements,if the agreements so provide, to discontinue lending, toaccelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which across-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, and/or todeclare all borrowings outstanding thereunder to be due andpayable. In addition, the lenders could terminate anycommitments they have to provide us with further funds. If anyof these events occur, we cannot assure you that we will havesufficient funds available to pay in full the total amount ofobligations that become due as a result of any suchacceleration, or that we will be able to find additional oralternative financing to refinance any such acceleratedobligations. Even if we obtain additional or alternativefinancing, we cannot assure you that it would be on terms thatwould be acceptable to us. Finally, we have agreed with the USWthat if we do not remain in compliance with our prevailingprincipal bank financial covenants, we will seek a substantialprivate equity investment. Any such investor or investors couldexercise influence over the management of our business and mayhave interests that conflict with the interests of our otherinvestors.     We cannot assure you that we will be able to remain incompliance with the covenants to which we are subject in thefuture and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtainwaivers from our lenders or amend the covenants.15Table of ContentsOur capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain    our competitive position.Our capital expenditures are limited by our liquidity andcapital resources and restrictions in our credit agreements. Theamount Goodyear has available for capital spending is limited bythe need to pay its other expenses and to maintain adequate cashreserves and borrowing capacity to meet unexpected demands thatmay arise. In addition, our credit facilities limit the amountof capital expenditures that we may make to $700 million ineach year through 2010. The amounts of permitted capitalexpenditures may be increased with the proceeds of equityissuances. In addition, unused capital expenditures may becarried over into the next year. In 2005, capital expendituresas defined in our borrowing agreements totaled $621 millionand are expected to increase to approximately $665 millionin 2006. Capital expenditures as defined in our borrowingagreements do not include capitalized software and includenon-cash capital lease transactions and, accordingly, differfrom capital expenditures reported in our ConsolidatedStatements of Cash Flows. We believe that our ratio of capitalexpenditures to sales is lower than the comparable ratio for ourprincipal competitors.     Productivity improvements through process re-engineering, designefficiency and manufacturing cost improvements may be requiredto offset potential increases in labor and raw material costsand competitive price pressures. In addition, as part of ourstrategy to increase the percentage of tires sold in higher costmarkets that are produced at our lower-cost productionfacilities, we may need to modernize or expand certain of thosefacilities. If we are unable to make sufficient capitalexpenditures, or to maximize the efficiency of the capitalexpenditures we do make, we may be unable to achieveproductivity improvements, which may harm our competitiveposition.Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest    rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to    increase significantly.Certain of our borrowings, primarily borrowings under our creditfacilities, are at variable rates of interest and expose us tointerest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt serviceobligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increaseeven though the amount borrowed remained the same, which wouldrequire us to use more of our available cash to service ourindebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will be able toenter into swap agreements or other hedging arrangements in thefuture, or that existing or future hedging arrangements willoffset increases in interest rates. At December 31, 2005,we had $2,764 million of variable rate debt outstanding.We may incur significant costs in connection with asbestos    claims.We are among many defendants named in legal proceedingsinvolving claims of individuals relating to alleged exposure toasbestos. At December 31, 2005, approximately 125,500claims were pending against us alleging various asbestos-relatedpersonal injuries purported to have resulted from allegedexposure to asbestos in certain rubber encapsulated products oraircraft braking systems manufactured by us in the past or toasbestos in certain of our facilities. We expect that additionalclaims will be brought against us in the future. Our ultimateliability with respect to such pending and unasserted claims issubject to various uncertainties, including the following:      the number of claims that are brought in the future;      the costs of defending and settling these claims;      the risk of insolvencies among our insurance carriers;      the possibility that adverse jury verdicts could require us to    pay damages in amounts greater than the amounts for which we    have historically settled claims;      the risk of changes in the litigation environment or Federal and    state law governing the compensation of asbestos    claimants; and      the risk that the bankruptcies of other asbestos defendants may    increase our costs.     Because of the uncertainties related to such claims, it ispossible that we may incur a material amount in excess of ourcurrent reserve for such claims. In addition, if any of theforegoing risks were to materialize, the16Table of Contentsresulting costs could have a material adverse impact on ourliquidity, financial position and results of operations infuture periods.We may be required to deposit cash collateral to support    an appeal bond if we are subject to a significant adverse    judgment, which may have a material adverse effect on our    liquidity.We are subject to various legal proceedings. If we wish toappeal any future adverse judgment in any of these proceedings,we may be required to post an appeal bond with the relevantcourt. We may be required to issue a letter of credit to thesurety posting the bond. We may issue up to an aggregate of$700 million in letters of credit under our$1.5 billion U.S. first lien credit facility. As ofDecember 31, 2005, we had $499 million in letters ofcredit issued under this facility. If we are subject to asignificant adverse judgment and do not have sufficientavailability under our credit facilities to issue a letter ofcredit to support an appeal bond, we may be required to pay downborrowings under the facilities or deposit cash collateral inorder to stay the enforcement of the judgment pending an appeal.A significant deposit of cash collateral may have a materialadverse effect on our liquidity. If we are unable to post cashcollateral, we may be unable to stay enforcement of the judgment.We are subject to extensive government regulations that    may materially adversely affect our operating results.We are subject to regulation by the Department of Transportationand by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, orNHTSA, which have established various standards and regulationsapplicable to tires sold in the United States and tires sold ina foreign country that are identical or substantially similar totires sold in the United States. NHTSA has the authority toorder the recall of automotive products, including tires, havingsafety-related defects. NHTSAs regulatory authority wasexpanded in November 2000 as a result of the enactment of theTransportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, andDocumentation Act, or TREAD Act. The TREAD Act imposes numerousrequirements with respect to the early warning reporting ofwarranty claims, property damage claims, and bodily injury andfatality claims and also requires tire manufacturers, amongother things, to conform with revised and more rigorous tiretesting standards, once the revised standards are implemented.Compliance with the TREAD Act regulations will increase the costof producing and distributing tires in the United States. Inaddition, while we believe that our tires are free from designand manufacturing defects, it is possible that a recall of ourtires, under the TREAD Act or otherwise, could occur in thefuture. A substantial recall could have a material adverseeffect on our reputation, operating results and financialposition. Compliance with these and other Federal, state andlocal laws and regulations in the future may require a materialincrease in our capital expenditures and could materiallyadversely affect the Companys earnings and competitiveposition.Our international operations have certain risks that may    materially adversely affect our operating results.Goodyear has manufacturing and distribution facilitiesthroughout the world. The international operations are subjectto certain inherent risks, including:      exposure to local economic conditions;      adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries    with the United States;      hostility from local populations and insurrections;      adverse currency exchange controls;      restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and    earnings;      withholding taxes and restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign    investment and earnings;      labor regulations;      expropriations of property;      the potential instability of foreign governments;      risks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements    with governmental authorities;      export and import restrictions; and      other changes in laws or government policies.17Table of ContentsThe likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect onGoodyear vary from country to country and are unpredictable.Certain regions, including Latin America and Asia, areinherently more economically and politically volatile and as aresult, our business units that operate in these regions couldbe subject to significant fluctuations in sales and operatingincome from quarter to quarter. Because a significant percentageof our operating income in recent years has come from theseregions, adverse fluctuations in the operating results in theseregions could have a disproportionate impact on our results ofoperations in future periods.We have foreign currency translation and transaction risks    that may materially adversely affect our operating    results.The financial condition and results of operations of certain ofour operating entities are reported in various foreigncurrencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at theapplicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financialstatements. As a result, the appreciation of theU.S. dollar against these foreign currencies has a negativeimpact on our reported sales and operating margin (andconversely, the depreciation of the U.S. dollar againstthese foreign currencies has a positive impact). For the fiscalyear ended December 31, 2005, we estimate that foreigncurrency translation favorably impacted sales and segmentoperating income by approximately $210 million and$95 million, respectively, compared to the prior year. Thevolatility of currency exchange rates may materially adverselyaffect our operating results.The terms and conditions of our global alliance with    Sumitomo Rubber Industries, Ltd. (SRI) provide for    certain exit rights available to SRI upon the occurrence of    certain events, which could require us to make a substantial    payment to acquire SRIs interest in certain of their joint    venture alliances.In 1999, we entered into a global alliance with SRI. Under theglobal alliance agreements, we acquired 75%, and SRI owned 25%,of Goodyear Dunlop Tires Europe B.V., which concurrently withthe transaction acquired substantially all of SRIs tirebusinesses in Europe and most of Goodyears tire businessesin Europe. We also acquired 75%, and SRI acquired 25%, ofGoodyear Dunlop Tires North America, Ltd., a holding companythat purchased SRIs tire manufacturing operations in NorthAmerica and certain of its primarily OE-related tire sales anddistribution operations. In addition, we also acquired 25% ofthe capital stock of two newly-formed tire companies in Japan,as well as 51% of the capital stock of a newly-formed technologycompany and 80% of the capital stock of a newly-formed globalpurchasing company. SRI owns the balance of the capital stock ineach of these companies. Under the Umbrella Agreement between usand SRI, SRI has the right to require us to purchase from SRIits ownership interests in the European and North American jointventures in September 2009 if certain triggering events haveoccurred. In addition, the occurrence of certain other eventsenumerated in the Umbrella Agreement, including certainbankruptcy events or changes in control of Goodyear, couldprovide SRI with the right to require us to repurchase theseinterests immediately. While we have not done any currentvaluation of these businesses, our cost of acquiring an interestin these businesses in 1999 was approximately $1.2 billion.Any payment required to be made to SRI pursuant to an exit underthe terms of the global alliance agreements could besubstantial. We cannot assure you that our operatingperformance, cash flow and capital resources would be sufficientto make such a payment or, if we were able to make the payment,that there would be sufficient funds remaining to satisfy ourother obligations. The withdrawal of SRI from the globalalliance could also have other adverse effects on our business.If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our    business could be materially adversely affected.Our business substantially depends on the continued service ofkey members of our management. The loss of the services of asignificant number of members of our management could have amaterial adverse effect on our business. Our future success willalso depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilledpersonnel, such as engineering, marketing and senior managementprofessionals. Competition for these employees is intense, andwe could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring andretaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If wedo not succeed in retaining our current employees and attractingnew high quality employees, our business could be materiallyadversely affected.18Table of Contents"
