 An investment in our common stock involves risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether an investment in our common stock is suitable for you. The risk factors described below are not the only ones we face. There may be other risks and uncertainties that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 8  Industry Specific Risks Our business is cyclical and can be negatively impacted by prolonged economic downturns, rising interest rates or tightening in the financial markets that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products. Demand for our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in the economy and in the financial markets. Our products are sold primarily to manufacturers of concrete products that are used for a broad range of nonresidential and residential construction applications. Demand for our products is driven by the level of construction activity, which tends to be correlated with conditions in the overall economy as well as other factors beyond our control. Rising interest rates or tightening in the financial markets could adversely impact demand for our products by increasing the cost of financing or reducing the availability of financing to our customers and the construction industry as a whole. Future prolonged periods of economic weakness, high interest rates or reduced availability of financing could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our business can be negatively impacted by reductions in the amount and duration of government funding for infrastructure projects that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products. Certain of our products are used in the construction of highways, bridges and other infrastructure projects that are funded by federal, state and local governments. Reductions in the amount of funding for such projects or the period for which it is provided, including as a result of budget uncertainty, the potential for U.S. Government shutdowns, the use of continuing resolutions and the federal debt ceiling, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Foreign competition could adversely impact our financial results.  Certain of our PC strand and SWWR markets are subject to foreign import competition on an ongoing basis. If we are unable to purchase raw materials and achieve manufacturing costs that are competitive with those of foreign producers, or if the margin and return requirements of foreign producers are substantially lower, our market share and profit margins could be negatively impacted. In response to illegally traded import competition from offshore PC strand and SWWR suppliers, we have pursued trade cases, when necessary, as a means of ensuring that foreign producers were complying with the applicable trade laws and regulations. Such actions may be costly and may not be successful. Trade law enforcement is critical to our ability to maintain our competitive position against foreign PC strand and SWWR producers that engage in unlawful trade practices. Our financial results can be negatively impacted by the volatility in the cost and availability of our primary raw material, hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod. The primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers. We do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in the price of wire rod as such instruments are currently unavailable in the financial markets. Prices for wire rod have become increasingly volatile in recent years driven by the higher degree of variability in raw material costs for rod producers, changes in trade policy and the fluctuation of domestic supply. In response, wire rod producers have resorted to increasing the frequency of price adjustments, typically on a monthly basis, as well as unilaterally changing the terms of prior commitments. Although changes in our wire rod costs and selling prices tend to be correlated, we may be unable to fully recover increased rod costs during weaker market environments, which would reduce our earnings and cash flows. Additionally, when raw material costs decline, our financial results would be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater extent and if we are consuming higher cost material from inventory. Our financial results can also be significantly impacted if raw material supplies are inadequate to satisfy our purchasing requirements. For example, U.S. government trade policies and trade actions by domestic wire rod producers against other countries can significantly impact the availability and cost of imported wire rod. The imposition of tariffs, quotas or anti-dumping or countervailing duty margins by the U.S. government against exporting countries can have the effect of reducing or eliminating their competitiveness and participation in the domestic market. If we were unable to obtain adequate and timely delivery of our raw material requirements, we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or operate our manufacturing facilities in an efficient manner, which could result in lost sales and higher operating costs. Because tight market conditions typically affect the entire industry, during past periods of short raw material supply, margins and profitability have been favorably impacted due to curtailed availability of PC strand and WWR that supported higher average selling prices. There is no assurance that future short supply conditions in raw material markets would result in similar outcomes, however. 9  Demand for our products is highly variable and difficult to forecast due to our minimal backlog and unanticipated changes that can occur in customer order patterns or inventory levels. Demand for our products is highly variable. The short lead times for customer orders and minimal backlog that characterize our business make it difficult to forecast the future level of demand for our products. In some cases, unanticipated softening in demand can be exacerbated by inventory rebalancing measures pursued by our customers, which may cause significant fluctuations in our sales, profitability and cash flows. Operational Risks Our manufacturing facilities are subject to unexpected equipment failures, operational interruptions and casualty losses. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture and sell our products, including unexpected equipment failures, operational interruptions and catastrophic losses due to other unanticipated events such as fires, explosions, accidents, adverse weather conditions and transportation interruptions. Any such equipment failures or events can subject us to plant shutdowns and periods of reduced production or unexpected downtime. Furthermore, the resolution of certain operational interruptions may require significant capital expenditures. Although our insurance coverage could offset the losses or expenditures relating to some of these events, our results of operations and cash flows would be negatively impacted to the extent that such claims were not covered or only partially covered by our insurance. Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the escalation of our operating costs.  Consistent with the experience of other employers, our labor, medical and workers’ compensation costs have increased substantially in recent years and are expected to continue to rise. If this trend continues, the cost of labor and to provide healthcare and other benefits to our employees could increase, adversely impacting profitability. As the labor market continues to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, availability of qualified employees and competition for them has escalated, which has increased costs associated with attracting and retaining employees. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequately skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently or that our labor costs will not increase as a result of a shortage in the availability of skilled employees. Additionally, employee turnover could result in lost time due to inefficiencies and the need for additional training, which could impact our operating results. Changes to healthcare regulations may also increase the cost of providing such benefits to our employees. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing, or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation or related proposals and policies on our results. Any significant increases in the costs attributable to our self-insured health and workers’ compensation plans could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, increasing transaction prices for freight, natural gas, electricity, fuel and consumables would adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution costs. For most of our business, we incur the transportation costs associated with the delivery of products to our customers. Although we have previously implemented numerous measures to offset the impact of increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that such actions will be effective. If we are unable to pass these additional costs through by raising our selling prices, our financial results could be adversely impacted. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of inflation. The recent rise in inflation has increased the costs of labor, energy, operating supplies and raw materials. If we are unable to pass these increases in costs to our customers it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations by increasing our overall cost structure. Our business and operations are subject to risks related to climate change. The long-term effects of global climate change could present both physical risks and transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes), which are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. These changes could over time affect, for example, the availability and cost of raw materials, commodities and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require. Additionally, we have facilities located in areas that may be impacted by the physical risks of climate change, and we face the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to our facilities and inventory as well as business interruption caused by such events. Furthermore, periods of extended inclement weather or associated flooding may inhibit construction activity utilizing our products and delay shipments of our products to customers. We believe that adaptation strategies to accommodate rising sea levels and other climate related phenomena could stimulate demand for our products to the extent that reinforced concrete products are essential to managing surface waters. 10  We also use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline and electricity in our operations, all of which could face increased regulation as a result of climate change or other environmental concerns. Additionally, we may face increased costs to respond to future water laws and regulations, and operations in areas with limited water availability may be impacted if droughts become more frequent or severe. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our costs or results of operations. Financing Risks Our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations that may impact our cash flows. Our shipments are typically lower in the first and second fiscal quarters due to the unfavorable impact of winter weather on construction activity during these periods and customer plant shutdowns associated with holidays. As a result, our cash flows may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to these seasonal factors. Our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for our capital investment and maintenance expenditures if we were to experience a substantial downturn in our financial performance. Our operations are capital intensive and require substantial recurring expenditures for the routine maintenance of our equipment and facilities. Although we expect to finance our business requirements through internally generated funds or from borrowings under our $100 million revolving credit facility, we cannot provide any assurances these resources will be sufficient to support our business. A material adverse change in our operations or financial condition could limit our ability to borrow funds under our credit facility, which could further adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. Any significant future acquisitions could require additional financing from external sources that may not be available on favorable terms, which could adversely impact our growth, operations, financial condition and results of operations. Legal and Regulatory Risks Changes in environmental compliance and remediation requirements could result in substantial increases in our capital investments and operating costs. Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment that could require substantial increases in capital investments and operating costs. These laws and regulations, which are constantly evolving, are becoming increasingly stringent, and the ultimate impact of compliance is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision. Legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change, including mandatory reductions in energy consumption or emissions of greenhouse gases, could impose significant costs on us, including costs related to energy requirements, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations.  General Risks Our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price can be adversely affected by pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. In the event of the renewed outbreak of COVID-19, the emergence of new variants or an outbreak of a different virus or disease, we could experience disruptions in our supply chain, operations, facilities and workforce which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price. Our stock price can be volatile, often in connection with matters beyond our control.  Equity markets in the U.S. have been increasingly volatile in recent years. During fiscal 2023, our common stock traded as high as $35.80 and as low as $24.00. There are numerous factors that could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including: variations in our financial results; changes in our business outlook and expectations for the construction industry; changes in market valuations of companies in our industry; and announcements by us, our competitors or industry participants that may be perceived to impact our financial results. 11  We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are susceptible to certain risks, including cybersecurity breaches and data leaks, which could adversely impact our business. Our increasing reliance on technology systems and infrastructure heightens our potential vulnerability to system failure and malfunction, breakdowns due to natural disasters, human error, unauthorized access, power loss and other unforeseen events. Data privacy breaches by employees and others with or without authorized access to our systems poses risks that sensitive data may be permanently lost or leaked to the public or other unauthorized persons. With the growing use and rapid evolution of technology, not limited to cloud-based computing and mobile devices, there are additional risks of unintentional data leaks. There is also the risk of theft of confidential information, intentional vandalism, industrial espionage and a variety of cyber-attacks that could compromise our internal technology system and infrastructure or result in data leaks in-house or at our third-party providers and business partners. While we have taken reasonable steps to protect the Company from cybersecurity risks and security breaches, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur. Failures of technology or related systems, cybersecurity incidents, or improper release of confidential information, could adversely impact our business or subject us to unexpected liabilities, expenditures and recovery time. Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the impairment of goodwill. Our balance sheet includes intangible assets, including goodwill and other separately identifiable assets related to prior acquisitions, and we may acquire additional intangible assets in connection with future acquisitions. We are required to review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if certain indicators of permanent impairment arise such as, among other things, a decline in our stock price and market capitalization or a reduction in our projected operating results and cash flows. If our review indicates that goodwill has been impaired, the impaired portion would have to be written-off during that period which could adversely impact our business and financial results. "

If we are unable to pass these additional costs through by raising our selling prices, our financial results could be adversely impacted.  Our business and operations are subject to risks related to climate change. The long-term effects of global climate change could present both physical risks and transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes), which are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. These changes could over time affect, for example, the availability and cost of raw materials, commodities and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require. Additionally, we have facilities located in areas that may be impacted by the physical risks of climate change, and we face the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to our facilities and inventory as well business interruption caused by such events. Furthermore, periods of extended inclement weather or associated flooding may inhibit construction activity utilizing our products and delay shipments of our products to customers. We also use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline and electricity in our operations, all of which could face increased regulation as a result of climate change or other environmental concerns. Additionally, we may face increased costs to respond to future water laws and regulations, and operations in areas with limited water availability may be impacted if droughts become more frequent or severe. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our costs or results of operations. Financing Risks Our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations that may impact our cash flows. Our shipments are typically lower in the first and second fiscal quarters due to the unfavorable impact of winter weather on construction activity during these periods and customer plant shutdowns associated with holidays. As a result, our cash flows may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to these seasonal factors.        9                   Our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for our capital investment and maintenance expenditures if we were to experience a substantial downturn in our financial performance. Our operations are capital intensive and require substantial recurring expenditures for the routine maintenance of our equipment and facilities. Although we expect to finance our business requirements through internally generated funds or from borrowings under our $100.0 million revolving credit facility, we cannot provide any assurances these resources will be sufficient to support our business. A material adverse change in our operations or financial condition could limit our ability to borrow funds under our credit facility, which could further adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. Any significant future acquisitions could require additional financing from external sources that may not be available on favorable terms, which could adversely impact our growth, operations, financial condition and results of operations. Legal and Regulatory Risks Changes in environmental compliance and remediation requirements could result in substantial increases in our capital investments and operating costs. Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment that could require substantial increases in capital investments and operating costs. These laws and regulations, which are constantly evolving, are becoming increasingly stringent, and the ultimate impact of compliance is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision. General Risks Our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price can be adversely affected by pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price can be adversely affected by pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Governments around the world have implemented stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, “shelter in place” and “stay at home” orders, travel restrictions, business curtailments, school closures, vaccination mandates and other measures. These measures, along with further voluntary measures by businesses and individuals, may impact our working conditions, productivity and operations, as well as those of our customers and suppliers. In addition, governments and central banks in several parts of the world have enacted fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to counteract the impacts of COVID-19. We are considered a critical infrastructure industry, as defined by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Although we have continued to operate our facilities to date consistent with federal guidelines and state and local orders, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and any preventive or protective actions taken by governmental authorities may have a material adverse effect on our operations, supply chain, customers and transportation networks, including business shutdowns or disruptions. The extent to which COVID-19 may adversely impact our business depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, depending upon the severity and duration of the outbreak, the emergence of additional virus variants, vaccination rates and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain or mitigate its effects. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may experience material adverse impacts to our business due to any resulting economic recession. We continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and the potential effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The situation remains dynamic and the ultimate duration and impact on our business are not known at this time. Our stock price can be volatile, often in connection with matters beyond our control.  Equity markets in the U.S. have been increasingly volatile in recent years. During fiscal 2021, our common stock traded as high as $44.00 and as low as $18.83. There are numerous factors that could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including: variations in our financial results; changes in our business outlook and expectations for the construction industry; changes in market valuations of companies in our industry; and announcements by us, our competitors or industry participants that may be perceived to impact our financial results.        10                   We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are susceptible to certain risks, including cybersecurity breaches and data leaks, which could adversely impact our business. Our increasing reliance on technology systems and infrastructure heightens our potential vulnerability to system failure and malfunction, breakdowns due to natural disasters, human error, unauthorized access, power loss and other unforeseen events. Data privacy breaches by employees and others with or without authorized access to our systems poses risks that sensitive data may be permanently lost or leaked to the public or other unauthorized persons. With the growing use and rapid evolution of technology, not limited to cloud-based computing and mobile devices, there are additional risks of unintentional data leaks. There is also the risk of the theft of confidential information, intentional vandalism, industrial espionage and a variety of cyber-attacks that could compromise our internal technology system and infrastructure or result in data leaks in-house or at our third-party providers and business partners. Failures of technology or related systems, or an improper release of confidential information, could adversely impact our business or subject us to unexpected liabilities. Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the impairment of goodwill. Our balance sheet includes intangible assets, including goodwill and other separately identifiable assets related to prior acquisitions, and we may acquire additional intangible assets in connection with future acquisitions. We are required to review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if certain indicators of permanent impairment arise such as, among other things, a decline in our stock price and market capitalization or a reduction in our projected operating results and cash flows. If our review indicates that goodwill has been impaired, the impaired portion would have to be written-off during that period which could adversely impact our business and financial results. "

 An investment in our common stock involves risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether an investment in our common stock is suitable for you. The risk factors described below are not the only ones we face. There may be other risks and uncertainties that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price can be adversely affected by pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies, such as the recent outbreak of COVID-19. Our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price can be adversely affected by pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies, such as the recent outbreak of COVID-19 which has spread from China to many other countries including the United States. In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic, and the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency. The outbreak has resulted in governments around the world implementing increasingly stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, “shelter in place” and “stay at home” orders, travel restrictions, business curtailments, school closures, and other measures. In addition, governments and central banks in several parts of the world have enacted fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to counteract the impacts of COVID-19. We are considered a critical infrastructure industry, as defined by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Although we have continued to operate our facilities to date consistent with federal guidelines and state and local orders, the outbreak of COVID-19 and any preventive or protective actions taken by governmental authorities may have a material adverse effect on our operations, supply chain, customers and transportation networks, including business shutdowns or disruptions. The extent to which COVID-19 may adversely impact our business depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, depending upon the severity and duration of the outbreak and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain or mitigate its effects. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may experience material adverse impacts to our business due to any resulting economic recession. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of COVID-19 have caused extreme volatility in financial and other capital markets which has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capital markets. In view of the rapidly changing business environment, unprecedented market volatility and heightened degree of uncertainty resulting from COVID-19, we are currently unable to fully determine its future impact on our business. Our business is cyclical and can be negatively impacted by prolonged economic downturns or tightening in the financial markets that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products. Demand for our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in the economy and in the financial markets. Our products are sold primarily to manufacturers of concrete products that are used for a broad range of nonresidential and residential construction applications. Demand for our products is driven by the level of construction activity, which tends to be correlated with conditions in the overall economy as well as other factors beyond our control. Tightening in the financial markets could adversely impact demand for our products by reducing the availability of financing to our customers and the construction industry as a whole and increasing the risk of payment defaults on our accounts receivable. Future prolonged periods of economic weakness or reduced availability of financing could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our business can be negatively impacted by reductions in the amount and duration of government funding for infrastructure projects that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products. Certain of our products are used in the construction of highways, bridges and other infrastructure projects that are funded by federal, state and local governments. Reductions in the amount of funding for such projects or the period for which it is provided could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.        7                   Our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations that may impact our cash flows. Our shipments are typically lower in the first and second fiscal quarters due to the unfavorable impact of winter weather on construction activity during these periods and customer plant shutdowns associated with holidays. As a result, our cash flows may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to these seasonal factors. Demand for our products is highly variable and difficult to forecast due to our minimal backlog and unanticipated changes that can occur in customer order patterns or inventory levels. Demand for our products is highly variable. The short lead times for customer orders and minimal backlog that characterize our business make it difficult to forecast the future level of demand for our products. In some cases, unanticipated softening in demand can be exacerbated by inventory rebalancing measures pursued by our customers, which may cause significant fluctuations in our sales, profitability and cash flows. Our financial results can be negatively impacted by the volatility in the cost and availability of our primary raw material, hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod. The primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers. We do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in the price of wire rod as such instruments are currently unavailable in the financial markets. Prices for wire rod have become increasingly volatile in recent years driven by the higher degree of variability in raw material costs for rod producers, changes in trade policy and the tightening of domestic supply. In response, wire rod producers have resorted to increasing the frequency of price adjustments, typically on a monthly basis as well as unilaterally changing the terms of prior commitments. Although changes in our wire rod costs and selling prices tend to be correlated, we may be unable to fully recover increased rod costs during weaker market environments, which would reduce our earnings and cash flows. Additionally, when raw material costs decline, our financial results would be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater extent and if we are consuming higher cost material from inventory. Our financial results can also be significantly impacted if raw material supplies are inadequate to satisfy our purchasing requirements. Also, U.S. government trade policies or trade actions by domestic wire rod producers against other countries can significantly impact the availability and cost of imported wire rod. The imposition of tariffs, quotas or anti-dumping or countervailing duty margins by the U.S. government against exporting countries can have the effect of reducing or eliminating their competitiveness and participation in the domestic market. If we were unable to obtain adequate and timely delivery of our raw material requirements, we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or operate our manufacturing facilities in an efficient manner, which could result in lost sales and higher operating costs. Because tight market conditions typically affect the entire industry, during past periods of short raw material supply, margins and profitability have been favorably impacted due to curtailed availability of PC strand and WWR that supported higher average selling prices. There is no assurance that future short supply conditions in raw material markets would result in similar outcomes, however. Foreign competition could adversely impact our financial results.  Certain of our PC strand and SWWR markets are subject to foreign import competition on an ongoing basis. If we are unable to purchase raw materials and achieve manufacturing costs that are competitive with those of foreign producers, or if the margin and return requirements of foreign producers are substantially lower, our market share and profit margins could be negatively impacted. In response to illegally traded import competition from offshore PC strand suppliers, we have pursued trade cases when necessary as a means of ensuring that foreign producers were complying with the applicable trade laws and regulations. These trade cases have resulted in the imposition of duties which have had the effect of limiting the continued participation of certain countries in the domestic market. Trade law enforcement is critical to our ability to maintain our competitive position against foreign PC strand and SWWR producers that engage in unlawful trade practices. Increasing unfair import competition and the perpetuation of the Section 232 tariff on imported steel, if not addressed, could continue to negatively impact our financial results and cash flows. The imposition of the Section 232 tariff on imported steel, which became effective in March 2018, has resulted in a surge in low-priced imports into PC strand and SWWR markets. The tariff, which applies to imports of our primary raw material but excludes our finished products, has provided offshore competitors with the incentive to circumvent the tariff by exporting downstream steel products not covered by the tariff.  Imports of PC strand and SWWR have been sold at unfairly low prices that prevent us from recovering higher raw material costs resulting from the tariff.  These underpricing tactics have enabled imports to expand their market share, thereby displacing U.S. production.  We and other domestic producers have filed trade actions in an attempt to remedy injury caused by unfair imports.   If the Administration does not remedy the unfair import pricing practices through the trade cases, and continues the tariff program without extending it to include our finished products, the resulting adverse impact on our market share, financial results and cash flow that we experienced during 2019 and 2020 will persist.         8                   Our manufacturing facilities are subject to unexpected equipment failures, operational interruptions and casualty losses. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture and sell our products, including unexpected equipment failures, operational interruptions and catastrophic losses due to other unanticipated events such as fires, explosions, accidents, adverse weather conditions and transportation interruptions. Any such equipment failures or events can subject us to plant shutdowns and periods of reduced production or unexpected downtime. Furthermore, the resolution of certain operational interruptions may require significant capital expenditures. Although our insurance coverage could offset the losses or expenditures relating to some of these events, our results of operations and cash flows would be negatively impacted to the extent that such claims were not covered or only partially covered by our insurance. We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are susceptible to certain risks, including cybersecurity breaches and data leaks, which could adversely impact our business. Our increasing reliance on technology systems and infrastructure heightens our potential vulnerability to system failure and malfunction, breakdowns due to natural disasters, human error, unauthorized access, power loss and other unforeseen events. Data privacy breaches by employees and others with or without authorized access to our systems poses risks that sensitive data may be permanently lost or leaked to the public or other unauthorized persons.

Failures of technology or related systems, or an improper release of confidential information, could adversely impact our business or subject us to unexpected liabilities. Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the escalation of our operating costs.  Consistent with the experience of other employers, our labor, medical and workers’ compensation costs have increased substantially in recent years and are expected to continue to rise. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) will have a significant impact on employers, health care providers, insurers and others associated with the health care industry and increase our employee health care costs. This legislation requires certain large employers like us to offer health care benefits to full-time employees or face potential annual penalties. To avoid these penalties, employers must offer health benefits providing a minimum level of coverage and limit the amount that employees are charged for the coverage. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing, or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation or related proposals and policies on our results. Any significant increases in the costs attributable to our self-insured health and workers’ compensation plans could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, increasing prices for freight, natural gas, electricity, fuel and consumables would adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution costs. For most of our business, we incur the transportation costs associated with the delivery of products to our customers. Although we have previously implemented numerous measures to offset the impact of increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that such actions will be effective. If we are unable to pass these additional costs through by raising our selling prices, our financial results could be adversely impacted.    Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the impairment of goodwill. Our balance sheet includes intangible assets, including goodwill and other separately identifiable assets related to prior acquisitions, and we may acquire additional intangible assets in connection with future acquisitions.

Reductions in the amount of funding for such projects or the period for which it is provided could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations that may impact our cash flows. Our shipments are typically lower in the first and second fiscal quarters due to the unfavorable impact of winter weather on construction activity during these periods and customer plant shutdowns associated with holidays. As a result, our cash flows may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to these seasonal factors. Demand for our products is highly variable and difficult to forecast due to our minimal backlog and unanticipated changes that can occur in customer order patterns or inventory levels. Demand for our products is highly variable. The short lead times for customer orders and minimal backlog that characterize our business make it difficult to forecast the future level of demand for our products. In some cases, unanticipated softening in demand can be exacerbated by inventory rebalancing measures pursued by our customers, which may cause significant fluctuations in our sales, profitability and cash flows. Our financial results can be negatively impacted by the volatility in the cost and availability of our primary raw material, hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod. The primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers. We do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in the price of wire rod as such instruments are currently unavailable in the financial markets. Beginning in fiscal 2004, a tightening of supply in the rod market together with fluctuations in the raw material costs of rod producers resulted in increased price volatility which has continued through fiscal 2018. In response, wire rod producers have resorted to increasing the frequency of price adjustments, typically on a monthly basis as well as unilaterally changing the terms of prior commitments. Although changes in our wire rod costs and selling prices tend to be correlated, we may be unable to fully recover increased rod costs during weaker market environments, which would reduce our earnings and cash flows. Additionally, when raw material costs decline, our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater extent and if we are consuming higher cost material from inventory. Our financial results can also be significantly impacted if raw material supplies are inadequate to satisfy our purchasing requirements. In addition, trade actions by the U.S. government, such as the imposition of the steel tariffs imposed under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, as amended, or domestic wire rod producers against other countries can significantly impact the availability and cost of imported wire rod. The imposition of tariffs, quotas or anti-dumping or countervailing duty margins by the U.S. government against exporting countries can have the effect of reducing or eliminating their competitiveness and participation in the domestic market, which is of increasing importance in view of the reductions in domestic wire rod production capacity that have occurred in recent years. If we were unable to obtain adequate and timely delivery of our raw material requirements, we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or operate our manufacturing facilities in an efficient manner, which could result in lost sales and higher operating costs. Foreign competition could adversely impact our financial results.  Our PC strand business, and, to a lesser extent, our SWWR business are subject to offshore import competition on an ongoing basis. If we are unable to purchase raw materials and achieve manufacturing costs that are competitive with those of foreign producers, or if the margin and return requirements of foreign producers are substantially lower, our market share and profit margins could be negatively impacted. In response to irrationally-priced import competition from offshore PC strand suppliers, we have pursued trade cases when necessary as a means of ensuring that foreign producers were complying with the applicable trade laws and regulations. These trade cases have resulted in the imposition of duties which have had the effect of limiting the continued participation of certain countries in the domestic market. Trade law enforcement is critical to our ability to maintain our competitive position against foreign PC strand and SWWR producers that engage in unlawful trade practices. 7  Our manufacturing facilities are subject to unexpected equipment failures, operational interruptions and casualty losses. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture and sell our products, including unexpected equipment failures, operational interruptions and catastrophic losses due to other unanticipated events such as fires, explosions, accidents, adverse weather conditions and transportation interruptions. For example, during fiscal 2017, operations at our Texas and Florida plants were temporarily curtailed due to flooding and power outages related to hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and during fiscal 2018, a transformer outage and electrical fire at our Dayton, Texas plant resulted in a temporary interruption of operations. Any such equipment failures or events can subject us to material plant shutdowns, periods of reduced production or unexpected downtime. Furthermore, the resolution of certain operational interruptions may require significant capital expenditures. Although our insurance coverage could offset the losses or expenditures relating to some of these events, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted to the extent that such claims were not covered or only partially covered by our insurance. We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are susceptible to certain risks, including cybersecurity breaches and data leaks, which could adversely impact our business. Our increasing reliance on technology systems and infrastructure heightens our potential vulnerability to system failure and malfunction, breakdowns due to natural disasters, human error, unauthorized access, power loss and other unforeseen events. Data privacy breaches by employees and others with or without authorized access to our systems poses risks that sensitive data may be permanently lost or leaked to the public or other unauthorized persons. With the growing use and rapid evolution of technology, not limited to cloud-based computing and mobile devices, there are additional risks of unintentional data leaks. There is also the risk of the theft of confidential information, intentional vandalism, industrial espionage and a variety of cyber-attacks that could compromise our internal technology system and infrastructure or result in data leaks in-house or at our third-party providers and business partners. Failures of technology or related systems, or an improper release of confidential information, could adversely impact our business or subject us to unexpected liabilities. Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the escalation of our operating costs.  Consistent with the experience of other employers, our medical and workers’ compensation costs have increased substantially in recent years and are expected to continue to rise. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) will have a significant impact on employers, health care providers, insurers and others associated with the health care industry and increase our employee health care costs. This legislation requires certain large employers like us to offer health care benefits to full-time employees or face potential annual penalties. To avoid these penalties, employers must offer health benefits providing a minimum level of coverage and limit the amount that employees are charged for the coverage. The Administration and Congress are pursuing legislative and regulatory changes that modify, repeal, replace with new legislation or otherwise invalidate all or certain portions of the ACA. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 effectively eliminated certain provisions of the ACA, including the individual mandate beginning in 2019. It is uncertain whether the other reform proposals being considered by the Administration and Congress will be enacted and potentially alter the full-time employee healthcare coverage requirement and reporting obligations imposed on large employers like us. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing, or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation or related proposals and policies on our results. Any significant increases in the costs attributable to our self-insured health and workers’ compensation plans could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, increasing prices for freight, natural gas, electricity, fuel and consumables would adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution costs. For most of our business, we incur the transportation costs associated with the delivery of products to our customers. Although we have previously implemented numerous measures to offset the impact of increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that such actions will be effective. If we are unable to pass these additional costs through by raising our selling prices, our financial results could be adversely impacted.    Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the impairment of goodwill. Our balance sheet includes intangible assets, including goodwill and other separately identifiable assets related to prior acquisitions, and we may acquire additional intangible assets in connection with future acquisitions. We are required to review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if certain indicators of permanent impairment arise such as, among other things, a decline in our stock price and market capitalization or a reduction in our projected operating results and cash flows. If our review indicates that goodwill has been impaired, the impaired portion would have to be written-off during that period which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. Our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for our capital investment and maintenance expenditures if we were to experience a substantial downturn in our financial performance. Our operations are capital intensive and require substantial recurring expenditures for the routine maintenance of our equipment and facilities. Although we expect to finance our business requirements through internally generated funds or from borrowings under our $100.0 million revolving credit facility, we cannot provide any assurances these resources will be sufficient to support our business. A material adverse change in our operations or financial condition could limit our ability to borrow funds under our credit facility, which could further adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. Any significant future acquisitions could require additional financing from external sources that may not be available on favorable terms, which could adversely impact our growth, operations, financial condition and results of operations. 8  Environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capital investments and operating costs. Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment that could require substantial increases in capital investments and operating costs. These laws and regulations, which are constantly evolving, are becoming increasingly stringent, and the ultimate impact of compliance is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision. Our stock price can be volatile, often in connection with matters beyond our control.  Equity markets in the U.S. have been increasingly volatile in recent years. During fiscal 2018, our common stock traded as high as $43.78 and as low as $24.51. There are numerous factors that could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including: variations in our financial results; changes in our business outlook and expectations for the construction industry; changes in market valuations of companies in our industry; and announcements by us, our competitors or industry participants that may be perceived to impact our financial results. "

In some cases, unanticipated downturns in demand can be exacerbated by inventory reduction measures pursued by our customers. The combination of these factors may cause significant fluctuations in our sales, profitability and cash flows.  Our customers may be adversely affected by negative macroeconomic conditions and tightening in the credit markets. Negative macroeconomic conditions and tightening in the credit markets could limit the ability of our customers to fund their financing requirements, thereby reducing their purchasing volume with us. Furthermore, a reduction in the availability of credit may increase the risk of customers defaulting on their payment obligations to us. The occurrence of these events could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our financial results can be negatively impacted by the volatility in the cost and availability of our primary raw material, hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod. The primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers. We do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in the price of wire rod as such instruments are currently unavailable in the financial markets. Beginning in fiscal 2004, a tightening of supply in the rod market together with fluctuations in the raw material costs of rod producers resulted in increased price volatility which has continued through fiscal 2015. In response to the increased pricing volatility, wire rod producers have resorted to increasing the frequency of price adjustments, typically on a monthly basis as well as unilaterally changing the terms of prior commitments.  Although changes in our wire rod costs and selling prices tend to be correlated, depending upon market conditions, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increased rod costs through higher selling prices, which would reduce our earnings and cash flow from operations. Additionally, should raw material costs decline, our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater degree and to the extent that we are consuming higher cost material from inventory.  Our financial results can also be significantly impacted if raw material supplies are inadequate to satisfy our purchasing requirements. In addition, trade actions by domestic wire rod producers against offshore suppliers can have a substantial impact on the availability and cost of imported wire rod. The imposition of anti-dumping or countervailing duty margins by the DOC against exporting countries can have the effect of reducing or eliminating their activity in the domestic market, which is of increasing significance in view of the reductions in domestic wire rod production capacity that have occurred in recent years. If we were unable to obtain adequate and timely delivery of our raw material requirements, we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or operate our manufacturing facilities in an efficient manner, which could result in lost sales and higher operating costs.  Foreign competition could adversely impact our financial results.  Our PC strand business is subject to offshore import competition on an ongoing basis in that domestic production capacity is insufficient to satisfy domestic demand in most market environments. If we are unable to purchase raw materials and achieve manufacturing costs that are competitive with those of foreign producers, or if the margin and return requirements of foreign producers are substantially lower, our market share and profit margins could be negatively impacted. In response to irrationally-priced import competition from offshore PC strand suppliers, we have pursued trade cases when necessary as a means of ensuring that foreign producers were complying with the applicable trade laws and regulations. These trade cases have resulted in the imposition of duties which have had the effect of limiting the continued participation of certain countries in the domestic market. Trade law enforcement is critical to our ability to maintain our competitive position against foreign PC strand producers that engage in unlawful trade practices.  8  Our manufacturing facilities are subject to unexpected equipment failures, operational interruptions and casualty losses. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture products, including unexpected equipment failures and catastrophic losses due to other unanticipated events such as fires, explosions, accidents, adverse weather conditions and transportation interruptions. For example, on January 21, 2014, a fire occurred at the Company’s Gallatin, Tennessee PC strand manufacturing facility, damaging a portion of the facility and requiring the temporary curtailment of operations until the necessary repairs were completed. Any such equipment failures or events can subject us to material plant shutdowns, periods of reduced production or unexpected downtime. Furthermore, the resolution of certain operational interruptions may require significant capital expenditures. Although our insurance coverage could offset the losses or expenditures relating to some of these events, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted to the extent that such claims were not covered or only partially covered by our insurance.  Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the escalation of our operating costs.  Our employee benefit costs, particularly our medical and workers’ compensation costs, have increased substantially in recent years and are expected to continue to rise. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 will have a significant impact on employers, health care providers, insurers and others associated with the health care industry and is expected to increase our employee health care costs. This legislation requires certain large employers like the Company to offer health care benefits to full-time employees or face potential annual penalties. To avoid these penalties, employers must offer health benefits providing a minimum level of coverage and limit the amount that employees are charged for the coverage. Provisions of this law have become and will become effective at various dates over the next several years and many of the regulations and guidance for the law have not been implemented. Due to the breadth and complexity of this law, the lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance and the phased-in nature of the requirement, we cannot predict the future effect of this law on our results. Any significant increases in the costs attributable to our self-insured health and workers’ compensation plans could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, higher prices for natural gas, electricity, fuel and consumables increase our manufacturing and distribution costs. Most of our sales are made under terms whereby we incur the fuel costs and surcharges associated with the delivery of products to our customers. Although we have previously implemented numerous measures to offset the impact of increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that such actions will be effective. If we are unable to pass these additional costs through by raising selling prices, our financial results could be adversely impacted.    Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the impairment of goodwill. Our balance sheet includes intangible assets, including goodwill and other separately identifiable assets primarily related to the ASW Acquisition. We may acquire additional intangible assets in connection with future acquisitions as part of our growth strategy. We are required to review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if certain indicators of permanent impairment arise such as, among other things, a decline in our stock price and market capitalization and lower than projected operating results and cash flows. If our review determined that goodwill had been impaired, the impaired portion would have to be written-off during that period which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. Our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for our capital investment and maintenance expenditures if we were to experience a substantial downturn in our financial performance.  Our operations are capital intensive and require substantial recurring expenditures for the routine maintenance of our equipment and facilities. Although we expect to finance our business requirements through internally generated funds or from borrowings under our $100.0 million revolving credit facility, we cannot provide any assurances these resources will be sufficient to support our business. A material adverse change in our operations or financial condition could limit our ability to borrow funds under our credit facility, which could further adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. Any significant future acquisitions could require additional financing from external sources that may not be available on favorable terms, which could adversely impact our operations, growth plans, financial condition and results of operations. Environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capital investments and operating costs. Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment that could require substantial increases in capital investments and operating costs. These laws and regulations, which are constantly evolving, are becoming increasingly stringent and the ultimate impact of compliance is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision.  9  Our stock price can be volatile, often in connection with matters beyond our control.  Equity markets in the U.S. have been increasingly volatile in recent years. During fiscal 2015, our common stock traded as high as $24.85 and as low as $14.61. There are numerous factors that could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including: variations in our quarterly and annual financial results; changes in our business outlook and the expectations for the construction industry; changes in market valuations of companies in our industry; and announcements by us, our competitors or industry participants that may be perceived to impact us or our operations.  "

 You should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the following risk factors, before investing in any of our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other future reports and statements that we file with the SEC.  Our business is cyclical and can be negatively impacted by prolonged economic downturns or reduced availability of financing in the credit markets that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products. Demand for our concrete reinforcing products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in the economy and in the availability of financing in the credit markets. Our products are sold primarily to manufacturers of concrete products for the construction industry and used for a broad range of nonresidential and residential construction applications. Demand in these markets is driven by the level of construction activity, which tends to be correlated with conditions in the general economy as well as other factors beyond our control. Tightening in the credit markets could unfavorably impact demand for our products by reducing the availability of financing to our customers and the construction industry as a whole. Future prolonged periods of economic weakness or reduced availability of financing could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our business can be negatively impacted by reductions in the amount and duration of government funding for infrastructure projects that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products. Certain of our products are used in the construction of highways, bridges and other infrastructure projects that are funded by federal, state and local governments. Reductions in the amount of funding for such projects or the period for which it is provided could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.    7  Our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations that may impact our cash flow.  Our shipments are generally lower in the first and second quarters primarily due to the unfavorable impact of winter weather conditions on construction activity and customer plant shutdowns associated with holidays.

The short lead times for customer orders and minimal backlog that characterize our business make it difficult to forecast the future level of demand for our products. In some cases, unanticipated downturns in demand have been exacerbated by inventory reduction measures pursued by our customers. The combination of these factors may cause significant fluctuations in our sales, profitability and cash flows.Our customers may be adversely affected by the continued negative macroeconomic conditions and tightening in the credit markets.Current negative macroeconomic conditions and the tightening in the credit markets could limit the ability of our customers to fund their financing requirements, thereby reducing their purchasing volume with us. Further, the reduction in the availability of credit may increase the risk of customers defaulting on their payment obligations to us. The continuation or occurrence of these events could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our financial results can be negatively impacted by the volatility in the cost and availability of our primary raw material, hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod. The primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers. We do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in the price of wire rod as such instruments are currently unavailable in the financial markets. Beginning in fiscal 2004, a tightening of supply in the rod market together with fluctuations in the raw material costs of rod producers resulted in increased price volatility which has continued through fiscal 2012. In response to the increased pricing volatility, wire rod producers have resorted to increasing the frequency of price adjustments, typically on a monthly basis as well as unilaterally changing the terms of prior commitments.Although changes in our wire rod costs and selling prices tend to be correlated, depending upon market conditions, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increased rod costs through higher selling prices, which would reduce gross profit and cash flow from operations. Additionally, should raw material costs decline, our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater degree and to the extent that we are consuming higher cost material from inventory.Our financial results can also be significantly impacted if raw material supplies are inadequate to satisfy our purchasing requirements. In addition, trade actions by domestic wire rod producers against offshore suppliers can have a substantial impact on the availability and cost of imported wire rod. The imposition of anti-dumping or countervailing duty margins by the DOC against exporting countries can have the effect of reducing or eliminating their activity in the domestic market, which is of increasing significance in view of the reductions in domestic wire rod production capacity that have occurred in recent years. If we were unable to obtain adequate and timely delivery of our raw material requirements, we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or operate our manufacturing facilities in an efficient manner, which could result in lost sales and higher operating costs.   8   Foreign competition could adversely impact our financial results.Our PC strand business is subject to offshore import competition on an ongoing basis in that in most market environments, domestic production capacity is insufficient to satisfy domestic demand. If we are unable to purchase raw materials and achieve manufacturing costs that are competitive with those of foreign producers, or if the margin and return requirements of foreign producers are substantially lower, our market share and profit margins could be negatively impacted. In response to irrationally-priced import competition from offshore PC strand suppliers, we have pursued trade cases when necessary as a means of ensuring that foreign producers were complying with the applicable trade laws and regulations. These trade cases have resulted in the imposition of duties which have had the effect of limiting the continued participation of certain countries in the domestic market. Trade law enforcement is critical to our ability to maintain our competitive position against foreign PC strand producers that engage in unlawful trade practices. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to unexpected equipment failures, operational interruptions and casualty losses.Our manufacturing facilities are subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture products, including unexpected equipment failures and catastrophic losses due to other unanticipated events such as fires, explosions, accidents, adverse weather conditions and transportation interruptions. Any such equipment failures or events can subject us to material plant shutdowns, periods of reduced production or unexpected downtime. Furthermore, the resolution of certain operational interruptions may require significant capital expenditures. Although our insurance coverage could offset the losses or expenditures relating to some of these events, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted to the extent that such claims were not covered or only partially covered by our insurance.Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the continued escalation in certain of our operating costs.Our employee benefit costs, particularly our medical and workers’ compensation costs, have increased substantially in recent years and are expected to continue to rise. In March 2010, Congress passed and the President signed The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This legislation may have a significant impact on health care providers, insurers and others associated with the health care industry. If the implementation of this legislation significantly increases the costs attributable to our self-insured health plans, it may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, higher prices for natural gas, electricity, fuel and consumables increase our manufacturing and distribution costs. Most of our sales are made under terms whereby we incur the fuel costs and surcharges associated with the delivery of products to our customers. Although we have implemented numerous measures to offset the impact of the ongoing escalation in these costs, there can be no assurance that such actions will be effective. If we are unable to pass these additional costs through by raising selling prices, our financial results could be adversely impacted.Our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for our capital investment and maintenance expenditures if we were to experience a substantial downturn in our financial performance.Our operations are capital intensive and require substantial recurring expenditures for the routine maintenance of our equipment and facilities. Although we expect to finance our business requirements through internally generated funds or from borrowings under our $100.0 million revolving credit facility, we cannot provide any assurances these resources will be sufficient to support our business. A material adverse change in our operations or financial condition could limit our ability to borrow funds under our credit facility, which could further adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. Any significant future acquisitions could require additional financing from external sources that may not be available on favorable terms, which could adversely impact our operations, growth plans, financial condition and results of operations.Environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capital investments and operating costs.Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment that could result in substantially increased capital investments and operating costs. These laws and regulations, which are constantly evolving, are becoming increasingly stringent and the ultimate impact of compliance is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision.Our stock price can be volatile, often in connection with matters beyond our control.Equity markets in the U.S. have been increasingly volatile in recent years. During fiscal 2012, our common stock traded as high as $13.74 and as low as $8.93. There are numerous factors that could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including: variations in our quarterly and annual operating results; changes in our business outlook; changes in market valuations of companies in our industry; changes in the expectations for nonresidential and residential construction; and announcements by us, our competitors or industry participants that may be perceived to impact us or our operations.    9   "

 You should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the following risk factors,before investing in any of our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impairour business or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other future reports and statements that we file with the SEC. Our business is cyclical and can be negatively impacted by prolonged economic downturns or tightening in the credit markets that reducethe level of construction activity and demand for our products.  Demand for our concrete reinforcing products iscyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in the economy and in the availability of financing in the credit markets. Our products are sold primarily to manufacturers of concrete products for the construction industry and used for a broadrange of nonresidential and residential construction applications. Demand in these markets is driven by the level of construction activity, which tends to be correlated with conditions in the general economy as well as other factors beyond ourcontrol. The tightening in the credit markets that occurred during fiscal 2009 and persisted into   7 Table of Contents2011 could continue to unfavorably impact demand for our products by reducing the availability of financing to our customers and the construction industry as a whole. Future prolonged periods ofeconomic weakness or reduced availability of financing could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  Our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations that may impact our cash flow.  Our shipments are generally lower in the first and second quarters primarily due to the reduced level of construction activity resulting from winter weather conditions together with customer plantshutdowns associated with holidays. As a result, our cash flow from operations may vary from quarter to quarter due to these seasonal factors. Demand for our products is highly variable and difficult to forecast due to our minimal backlog and the unanticipated changes that can occur incustomer order patterns or inventory levels.  Demand for our products is highly variable. The short lead times forcustomer orders and minimal backlog that characterize our business make it difficult to forecast the future level of demand for our products. In some cases, unanticipated downturns in demand have been exacerbated by inventory reduction measurespursued by our customers. The combination of these factors may cause significant fluctuations in our sales, profitability and cash flows. Our customers may be adversely affected by the continued negative macroeconomic conditions and tightening in the credit markets. Current negative macroeconomic conditions and the tightening in the credit markets could limit the ability of ourcustomers to fund their financing requirements, thereby reducing their purchasing volume with us. Further, the reduction in the availability of credit may increase the risk of customers defaulting on their payment obligations to us. The continuationor occurrence of these events could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Demandfor our products could be significantly impacted by the timing in resolving a new federal transportation funding authorization and the magnitude of the infrastructure-related funding that is provided for requiring the use of our products. The previous federal transportation funding authorization, SAFETEA-LU, expired in September 2009 and has subsequentlybeen extended through a series of interim measures, the most recent of which expires in March 2012. The additional federal funding provided for under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) has not had a significant impact onthe demand for our products as a high proportion of the projects funded have been for pavement resurfacing and repairs, which do not require the use of our products, and any favorable impact has been offset by reduced spending at the state and localgovernment level due to fiscal constraints. Failure to enact a new multi-year federal funding authorization in a timely manner could have a negative impact on demand for our products.  Our financial results can be negatively impacted by the volatility in the cost and availability of our primary raw material, hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod. The primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic andforeign suppliers. We do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in the price of wire rod as such instruments are currently unavailable in the financial markets. Beginning in fiscal 2004, a tightening of supply inthe rod market together with fluctuations in the raw material costs of rod producers resulted in increased price volatility which has continued through fiscal 2011. In response to the increased pricing volatility, wire rod producers have resorted toincreasing the frequency of price adjustments, typically on a monthly basis as well as unilaterally changing the terms of prior commitments.  Although changes in our wire rod costs and selling prices tend to be correlated, depending upon market conditions, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increased rod coststhrough higher selling prices, which would reduce gross profit and cash flow from operations. Additionally, should raw material costs decline, our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to aneven greater degree and to the extent that we are consuming higher cost material from inventory, as we experienced during certain periods of fiscal 2009 and 2010.  Our financial results can also be significantly impacted if raw material supplies are inadequate to satisfy our purchasing requirements. Trade actions by domestic wire rod producers against offshoresuppliers can also have a substantial impact on the availability and cost of imported wire rod. The imposition of anti-dumping or countervailing duty margins by the U.S. Department of Commerce (the DOC) against exporting countries canhave the effect of reducing or eliminating their activity in the domestic market, which is of increasing significance in view of the reductions in domestic wire rod production capacity that have occurred in recent years. If we were unable to obtainadequate and timely delivery of our raw material requirements, we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or operate our manufacturing facilities in an efficient manner, which could result in lost sales and higheroperating costs.   8 Table of ContentsWe may not be successful in fully realizing the anticipated synergies from the Ivy Acquisition, whichcould have a negative impact on our financial results.  Although we essentially completed the integration of the IvyAcquisition during fiscal 2011 and are realizing a substantial portion of the anticipated synergies, there could be delays, disruptions or other unexpected challenges arise in connection with the completion of the remaining reconfigurationactivities at certain of the Ivy facilities. If these delays, disruptions or other challenges occur and not be effectively resolved, we could fail to realize the remainder of the anticipated synergies from the Ivy Acquisition which may have amaterial adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.  Foreign competition could adversely impact our financialresults.  Our PC strand business is subject to offshore import competition on an ongoing basis in that in most marketenvironments, domestic production capacity is insufficient to satisfy domestic demand. If we are unable to purchase raw materials and achieve manufacturing costs that are competitive with those of foreign producers, or if the margin and returnrequirements of foreign producers are substantially lower, our market share and profit margins could be negatively impacted. In response to irrationally-priced import competition from offshore PC strand suppliers, we have pursued trade cases whennecessary as a means of ensuring that foreign producers were complying with the applicable trade laws and regulations.  In2003, we, together with a coalition of domestic producers of PC strand, obtained a favorable determination from the DOC in response to the petitions we had filed alleging that imports of PC strand from Brazil, India, Korea, Mexico and Thailand werebeing dumped or sold in the U.S. at a price that was lower than fair value and had injured the domestic PC strand industry. The DOC imposed anti-dumping duties ranging from 12% up to 119%, which had the effect of limiting theparticipation of these countries in the domestic market.  In 2010, we, together with a coalition of domestic producers of PCstrand, obtained favorable determinations from the DOC in response to the petitions we had filed alleging that imports of PC strand from China were being dumped or sold in the U.S. at a price that was lower than fair value and thatsubsidies were being provided to Chinese PC strand producers by the Chinese government, both of which had injured the domestic PC strand industry. The DOC imposed final countervailing duty margins ranging from 9% to 46% and anti-dumping marginsranging from 43% to 194%, which had the effect of limiting the continued participation of Chinese producers in the domestic market.  Ourmanufacturing facilities are subject to unexpected equipment failures, operational interruptions and casualty losses. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture products, including unexpected equipmentfailures and catastrophic losses due to other unanticipated events such as fires, explosions, accidents, adverse weather conditions and transportation interruptions.

We expect the combinationof the businesses will allow for the realization of synergies that reduce operating costs andprovide other operational benefits. There can be no assurance, however, regarding when or theextent to which the combined business will be able to realize these synergies. Successfulintegration will depend on our ability to consolidate operations, implement procedures andintegrate the employees, assets and systems of Ivy with our own. This integration process issubject to delays, disruptions and other challenges, which may include:  potential loss of key employees or customers;   possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies between thebusinesses and the need to implement company-wide financial, accounting, information andother systems;   failure to maintain the quality of service and products that we or Ivy have historicallyprovided;   costs associated with employee redeployment, relocation or severance;   costs associated with reorganizing or closing facilities, or relocating or disposing ofexcess equipment;   the diversion of managements attention from our day-to-day business and broaderbusiness strategy as a result of the need to address delays, disruptions and otherchallenges and the potential need to add management resources to do so;   commitment of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and   unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the Ivy Transaction.          These delays, disruptions and other challenges, if they occur and are not effectivelyresolved, may cause us to fail to realize the anticipated synergies from the Ivy Transaction, andmay have a material adverse short- and long-term impact on our operating results and financialcondition.Foreign competition could adversely impact our financial results.          Our PC strand business is subject to offshore import competition on an ongoing basis in thatin most market environments, domestic production capacity is insufficient to satisfy domesticdemand.

If we were unable toobtain adequate and timely delivery of our raw material requirements, we may be unable tomanufacture sufficient quantities of our products or operate our manufacturing facilities in anefficient manner which could result in lost sales and higher operating costs.Foreign competition could adversely impact our financial results.          Our PC strand business has experienced increasing competitive pressures from offshoreproducers exporting into the domestic market, particularly from China. Beginning in the second halfof fiscal 2007, we elected not to pursue certain PC strand business that had been negativelyimpacted by low-priced Chinese import competition. If we are unable to purchase raw materials andachieve manufacturing costs that are competitive with those of foreign producers, or if the marginand return requirements of foreign producers are substantially lower, our market share and profitmargins could be negatively impacted.          In 2003, we, together with a coalition of U.S. producers of PC strand, obtained a favorabledetermination from the International Trade Commission (the ITC) in response to the petitions wehad filed alleging that imports of PC strand from Brazil, India, Korea, Mexico and Thailand werebeing dumped or sold in the U.S. at a price that was lower than the price in their home marketsor their cost and had injured the domestic PC strand industry. The ITC imposed anti-dumping dutiesranging from 12% up to 119% which had the effect of limiting the participation of these companiesin the domestic market. The ITC is expected to complete its sunset review of these duties onNovember 10, 2009. Should the ITC vote against the continuation of the duties, imports of PC strandfrom these countries are likely to rise, which would have a negative impact on our PC strandbusiness.          In May 2009, a coalition of U.S. PC strand producers, including Insteel, filed antidumping andcountervailing duty petitions alleging that imports of PC strand from China were injuring thedomestic PC strand industry. The petitions allege that imports of PC strand from China were beingdumped or sold in the U.S. at a price that was lower than its fair value and that subsidies werebeing provided to Chinese PC strand producers by the Chinese government. The petitioners arealleging dumping margins ranging from 140.31% to 314.99%, with an average margin of 223.47%.          On October 27, 2009, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) issued a preliminarydetermination in the affirmative regarding the countervailing duty case, imposing preliminarymargins ranging from 7.53% to 12.06% on imports of PC strand from China. As a result, importers arerequired to post cash deposits or bonds on all future imports of Chinese PC strand in the amount ofthe preliminary margins calculated by the DOC. The current deadline for the preliminary decision onthe antidumping case is December 3, 2009. If the DOC rules in the affirmative on the antidumpingcase, importers would be required to begin posting cash deposits or bonds on all future imports ofChinese PC strand in the amount of the preliminary antidumping margins calculated by the DOC inaddition to the preliminary countervailing duty margins. The entire investigative process isanticipated to take approximately one year, with the final determinations of injury, dumping andsubsidies expected to occur in mid-2010.Our manufacturing facilities are subject to unexpected equipment failures, operationalinterruptions and casualty losses.          Our manufacturing facilities are subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufactureproducts, including unexpected equipment failures and catastrophic losses due to otherunanticipated events such as fires, explosions, accidents, adverse weather conditions andtransportation interruptions. Any such equipment failures or events can subject us to materialplant shutdowns, periods of reduced production or unexpected downtime. Furthermore, the resolutionof certain operational interruptions may require significant capital expenditures. Although ourinsurance coverage could offset the losses or expenditures relating to some of these events, ourresults of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted to the extent that such claimswere not covered or only partially covered by our insurance.Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the continued escalation in certain of ouroperating costs.          Our employee benefit costs, particularly our medical and workers compensation costs, haveincreased substantially in recent years and are expected to continue to rise. In addition, higherprices for natural gas, electricity, fuel and consumables increase our manufacturing anddistribution costs. Most of our sales are made under terms whereby we incur the fuel costs andsurcharges associated with the delivery of products to our customers. Although we have implementednumerous measures to offset the impact of the ongoing escalation in these costs, there can be noassurance that such actions will be effective. If we are unable to pass these additional coststhrough by raising selling prices, our financial results could be adversely impacted.Our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for our capital investment and maintenanceexpenditures if we were to9Table of Contentsexperience a substantial downturn in our financial performance.          Our operations are capital intensive and require substantial recurring expenditures for theroutine maintenance of our equipment and facilities. Although we expect to finance our businessrequirements through internally generated funds or from borrowings under our $100.0 millionrevolving credit facility, we cannot provide any assurances these resources will be sufficient tosupport our business. A material adverse change in our operations or financial condition couldlimit our ability to borrow funds under our credit facility which could further adversely impactour liquidity and financial condition. Any significant future acquisitions could require additionalfinancing from external sources and may not be available on favorable terms which could adverselyimpact our operations, growth plans, financial condition and results of operations.Environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capitalinvestments and operating costs.          Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations pertainingto the protection of the environment that could result in substantially increased capitalinvestments and operating costs. These laws and regulations, which are constantly evolving, arebecoming increasingly stringent and the ultimate impact of compliance is not always clearly knownor determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or areundergoing revision.Our production and earnings could be reduced by strikes or work stoppages by our unionizedemployees.          As of October 3, 2009, we employed 438 people, of which 44 were represented by labor unions(39 employees at our Wilmington, Delaware facility and 5 employees at our Jacksonville, Floridafacility). We have collective bargaining agreements in place with each union. The agreement for theWilmington facility expires on November 10, 2012. The agreement for the Jacksonville facilityexpires on April 30 of each year and is automatically renewed unless either party providesnotification of its intent to modify or terminate the agreement. Should we experience a disruptionof production at any facility, we have contingency plans in place that would enable us to continueserving our customers, although there can be no assurances that a strike, slowdown or work stoppagewould not adversely impact our operating costs and overall financial results.Our stock price can be volatile, often in connection with matters beyond our control.          Equity markets in the U.S. have often been volatile. During fiscal 2009, our common stocktraded as high as $14.72 and as low as $4.76. The following factors could cause the price of ourcommon stock to fluctuate significantly, several of which are beyond our control: variations in ourquarterly and annual operating results; changes in our business outlook; changes in marketvaluations of companies in our industry; changes in the expectations for nonresidential andresidential construction; and announcements by us, our competitors or industry participants thatmay be perceived to impact us or our operations"

          You should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this Form 10-K, includingthe following risk factors, before investing in any of our securities. The risks described beloware not the only ones we face. Additional risks that are currently unknown to us or that wecurrently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financialcondition and results of operations. Our business, financial condition and results of operationscould be adversely affected by any of these risks. We may amend or supplement these risk factorsfrom time to time by other reports that we file with the SEC in the future.Our business is cyclical and can be negatively impacted by prolonged economic downturns ortightening in the credit markets that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for ourproducts.          Demand for our concrete reinforcing products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes inthe economy and in the credit markets. Our products are sold primarily to manufacturers of concreteproducts for the construction industry and used for a broad range of nonresidential and residentialconstruction applications. Demand in these markets is driven by the level of construction activity,which tends to be correlated with conditions in the general economy as well as other factors beyondour control. The recent tightening in the credit markets could unfavorably impact demand for ourproducts by reducing the availability of financing to our customers and the construction industryas a whole. Although the implementation of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 andrelated measures is expected to improve liquidity in the financial markets and increase theavailability of financing, the timing and magnitude of the impact is highly uncertain at this time.Futureprolonged periods of economic weakness or reduced availability of financing could have amaterial adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.7Table of ContentsDemand for our products is highly variable and difficult to forecast due to our minimal backlog andthe unanticipated changes that can occur in customer order patterns or inventory levels.          Demand for our products is highly variable. The short lead times for customer orders andminimal backlog that characterize our business make it difficult to forecast the future level ofdemand for our products. In some cases, unanticipated downturns in demand have been exacerbated byinventory reduction measures pursued by our customers. The combination of these factors may causesignificant fluctuations in our sales, profitability and cash flows.Our financial results can be negatively impacted by the volatility in the cost and availability ofour primary raw material, hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod.          The primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod,which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers. We do not use derivative commodityinstruments to hedge our exposure to changes in the price of wire rod as such instruments arecurrently unavailable in the financial markets. Beginning in fiscal 2004, a tightening of supply inthe rod market together with fluctuations in the raw material costs of rod producers resulted inincreased price volatility which has continued through fiscal 2008, when wire rod prices rose to arecord high. Wire rod producers have resorted to increasing the frequency of price adjustments,typically on a monthly basis as well as unilaterally changing the terms of prior commitments.          Although changes in our wire rod costs and selling prices tend to be correlated, dependingupon market conditions, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increasedrod costs through higher selling prices, which would reduce gross profit and cash flow fromoperations. Additionally, should raw material costs decline, our financial results may benegatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater degree andto the extent that we are consuming higher cost material from inventory.          Our financial results can also be significantly impacted if raw material supplies areinadequate to satisfy our purchasing requirements. Trade actions by domestic wire rod producersagainst offshore suppliers can also have a substantial impact on the availability and cost ofimported wire rod. The imposition of anti-dumping margins by the Department of Commerce againstexporting countries can have the effect of reducing or eliminating their activity in the domesticmarket, which is of increasing significance in view of the reductions in domestic wire rodproduction capacity that have occurred in recent years. If we were unable to obtain adequate andtimely delivery of our raw material requirements, we may be unable to manufacture sufficientquantities of our products or operate our manufacturing facilities in an efficient manner whichcould result in lost sales and higher operating costs.Foreign competition could adversely impact our financial results.          Our PC strand business has experienced increasing competitive pressures from offshoreproducers exporting into the domestic market, particularly from China.

The International Trade Commission (ITC) imposed anti-dumpingduties ranging from 12% up to 119% which had the effect of limiting the participation of thesecompanies in the domestic market. Should domestic market conditions deteriorate in the future towhere U.S. producers could demonstrate that imports were being dumped in the U.S. market and werecausing or threatening to cause material injury to the domestic industry, we would anticipatecoordinating with other U.S. producers to pursue similar trade cases, although no assurances can beprovided that the outcome of such actions would be favorable.Our manufacturing facilities are subject to unexpected equipment failures, operationalinterruptions and casualty losses.          Our manufacturing facilities are subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufactureproducts, including unexpected equipment failures and catastrophic losses due to otherunanticipated events such as fires, explosions, accidents, adverse weather conditions andtransportation interruptions.

Following the expiration of the Delaware bargaining agreement on November 22,2006, union employees continued to work without disruption while negotiations were in process on anew collective agreement, which was reached on August 18, 2008 and expires on November 10, 2012. The collective bargaining agreement with the union at the Jacksonville facility expires on April 30of each year and is automatically renewed unless either party provides notification of its intentto modify or terminate the agreement.

Although we expect to finance our businessrequirements through internally generated funds or from borrowings under our $100.0 millionrevolving credit facility, we cannot provide any assurances these resources will be sufficient tosupport our business. Any significant future acquisitions could require additional financing fromexternal sources and may not be available on favorable terms which could adversely impact ouroperations, growth plans, financial condition and results of operations.Environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capitalinvestments and operating costs.          Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations pertainingto the protection of the environment that could result in substantially increased capitalinvestments and operating costs. These laws and regulations,7 which are constantly evolving, are becoming increasingly stringent and the ultimate impact ofcompliance is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these lawshave not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision.Our production and earnings could be reduced by strikes or work stoppages by our unionizedemployees.          As of September 30, 2006, we employed 621 people, of which approximately 66 were representedby a labor union (approximately 60 employees at our Wilmington, Delaware facility and 6 employeesat our Jacksonville, Florida facility). The collective bargaining agreement with the union at theWilmington facility expired on November 10, 2006. Despite intense negotiations that preceded theexpiration of the agreement, we were unable to agree on terms of a new labor contract with theunion. We allowed the Wilmington employees to return to work on November 13, 2006 under the termsof our last best and final offer. On November 22, 2006, the union filed an unfair labor practicecharge against us with the National Labor Relations Board alleging that we: (1) failed to bargainin good faith with the union; (2) unilaterally implemented changes to the terms of conditions ofemployment; (3) refused to meet with the representative of the union for purposes of bargaining;and (4) refused to supply information for purposes of collective bargaining. We believe we haveacted lawfully in these negotiations and we intend to defend the unfair labor practice charge. Thecollective bargaining agreement with the union at the Jacksonville facility expires in April 2008.Should we experience a disruption of production at any facility, we have contingency plans in placethat would enable us to continue serving our customers, although there can be no assurances that astrike, slowdown or work stoppage would not adversely impact our operating costs and overallfinancial results"

Risks Related to the Companys BusinessThe Companys business is seasonal and cyclical where prolonged economic declines could have amaterial adverse effect on its financial performance.     Demand for most of the Companys products is both seasonal and cyclical and sensitive togeneral economic conditions. The Companys concrete reinforcing products are used for a broad rangeof nonresidential, infrastructure and residential construction applications. Demand in thesemarkets is driven by the level of construction activity, which generally is highest in the thirdand fourth quarters of the Companys fiscal year when weather conditions are more conducive. As aresult of the seasonal nature of the construction industry, sales and profitability generally arelower in the first and second fiscal quarters.     The Companys industrial wire products are used in the manufacture of tires and for a broadrange of other industrial applications where the seasonal changes are not as pronounced as they arefor concrete reinforcing products. However, demand for these products tends to be cyclical based onchanges in general economic conditions, sales of new vehicles as well as replacement tires, and theoverall level of manufacturing activity. A prolonged slowdown in the economy or weakeningconditions in any of the markets that the Company serves could have a material adverse impact onits results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Fluctuations in the cost and availability of the Companys primary raw material from domestic andforeign suppliers could have a material adverse effect on its financial performance due to reducedspreads between wire rod costs and selling prices, and increased production costs associated withthe underutilization of its facilities should the supply of wire rod be insufficient to satisfy itsrequirements.     The primary raw material used to manufacture the Companys products is hot-rolled carbon steelwire rod, which is purchased from both domestic and foreign suppliers. During 2005 and 2004,imported wire rod represented approximately 50% and 52%, respectively, of the Companys total wirerod purchases. While favorable market conditions have enabled the Company to raise its sellingprices to recover the escalation in wire rod cost that it experienced in 2004, there can be noassurance that such favorable conditions will continue or that future cost increases will berecovered. Additionally, should rod costs decline significantly in the future, the Companysfinancial results may be negatively impacted due to unfavorable inventory revaluation adjustmentsand reduced spreads if the selling prices for its products were to decrease by an even greaterextent.6      During 2004, the Company lost production time at certain facilities because it was unable toobtain sufficient quantities of wire rod due to unanticipated delays in foreign deliveries and theopportunistic policies of domestic suppliers. Work stoppages during 2005 at two wire rod productionfacilities in North America have caused the supply of wire rod to tighten materially and prices torise. In addition, during November 2005 five domestic producers of wire rod filed antidumpingpetitions against offshore wire rod producers that represented 54% of the imported wire rod supplyfor the year preceding the filing of the petitions. While the Company believes it has made adequatesourcing arrangements to maintain normal production schedules ,the recurrence of wire rodshortages could result in lost production time at the Companys facilities and adversely impact theCompanys results of operations and financial conditions.Unexpected equipment failures or operational interruptions may lead to curtailments in productionor shutdowns.     If the Company were to experience operational interruptions for any reason, it would benegatively impacted by increased production costs as well as reduced sales and earnings. Inaddition to equipment failures, the Companys manufacturing facilities are also subject to the riskof catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions or adverse weatherconditions. The Companys manufacturing processes depend on the efficient operation of criticalequipment, which may be out of service on occasion because of unanticipated failures. In thefuture, any such equipment failures could subject the Company to material plant shutdowns orperiods of reduced production or unexpected down-time. Furthermore, any operational interruptionsmay require significant capital expenditures to remedy, which could have a negative effect on theCompanys profitability and cash flows. Although the Company maintains business interruptioninsurance, any recoveries for such claims could potentially be insufficient to offset the lostrevenues or increased costs that may be experienced. In addition to the revenue losses, which maybe recoverable under the policy, business disruptions of a repeated or long-term nature couldresult in a loss of customers which could adversely affect future sales, profitability and cashflow.The Companys production costs may increase should commodity prices continue to rise because itdoes not hedge its exposure to price fluctuations for its raw materials.     The Company does not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposures to changes incommodity prices, including prices of hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod. Historically, the Companyhas typically negotiated quantities and pricing on a quarterly basis for both domestic and foreignsteel wire rod purchases to manage its exposure to price fluctuations and to ensure adequateavailability of material consistent with its requirements. However, beginning in 2004, a tighteningof supply in the rod market together with fluctuations in the raw material costs of rod producershas resulted in increased price volatility which could continue in the future. In some instances,wire rod producers have resorted to increasing the frequency of price adjustments, typically on amonthly basis as well as unilaterally changing the terms of prior commitments. Because the Companygenerally does not hedge against price fluctuations as hedging vehicles are currently unavailablein the financial markets, it may be forced to purchase wire rod at higher than anticipated prices.Although changes in its wire rod costs and selling prices tend to be correlated, depending uponmarket conditions, there may be periods during which the Company is unable to fully recoverincreased rod costs through higher selling prices, which would reduce gross profit and cash flowfrom operations.The Companys variable rate indebtedness subjects it to interest rate risk, which could cause itsannual debt service obligations to increase significantly.     All of the Companys debt obligations under its senior secured credit facility are at variablerates of interest which exposes it to interest rate risk. Because the Company has not entered intointerest rate hedging instruments relating to current or future borrowings on its credit facility,if interest rates rise, interest expense on its variable rate indebtedness would increase,decreasing earnings and cash flow.The Company could have difficulty meeting its funding requirements for debt service, capitalinvestment and maintenance expenditures if there was a substantial downturn in its financialperformance.     As of October 1, 2005, the Company had approximately $11.9 million of long-term debtoutstanding under its senior secured credit facility. The Companys operations are capitalintensive and require substantial recurring expenditures for the routine maintenance of itsequipment and facilities. Although the Company expects to finance its business requirements throughinternally generated funds or from borrowings under its senior secured credit facility, it cannotprovide any assurances this will be the case. In the event of a material adverse change in theCompanys financial condition or business operations, the Company may not be able to access fundsunder its senior secured credit facility. In the event that the Company cannot meet its fundingobligations through internally generated funds or from borrowings on its credit facility and cannotaccess other sources of capital, its financial condition and results of operations would bematerially adversely impacted.7 The Companys ability and the ability of some of its subsidiaries to engage in some businesstransactions may be limited by the terms of its debt.     The Companys senior secured credit facility contains a number of financial covenantsrequiring it to meet certain financial ratios and financial condition tests, as well as othercovenants that restrict or limit its ability to:  incur additional debt;   pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase capital stock;   allow its subsidiaries to issue new stock to any person other than itself or any of its other subsidiaries;   make investments;   incur or permit to exist liens;   enter into transactions with affiliates;   guarantee the debt of other entities, including joint ventures;   merge or consolidate or otherwise combine with another company; and   transfer or sell its assets.     The Companys ability to borrow under its credit facility will depend upon its ability tocomply with these covenants and borrowing base requirements. The Companys ability to meet thesecovenants and requirements may be affected by events beyond its control which may result in theinability to meet these obligations. The Companys failure to comply with these covenants andrequirements could result in an event of default under its credit facility that, if not cured orwaived, could terminate its ability to borrow further, permit acceleration of the relevant debt andpermit foreclosure on any collateral granted as security under its credit facility.Environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capitalrequirements and operating costs.     The Companys businesses are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulationsrelating to the protection of the environment that could result in substantially increased capital,operating and compliance costs or investments. These laws are constantly evolving and becomingincreasingly stringent. The ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is notalways clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet beenpromulgated or are undergoing revision.The Companys production and earnings could be reduced by strikes or work stoppages by itsunionized employees.     As of October 1, 2005, the Company employed 655 people, of which approximately 57 were unionmembers (approximately 53 employees at its Wilmington, Delaware facility and 4 employees at itsJacksonville, Florida facility). The Company has collective bargaining agreements in place witheach union, which expire in November 2006 for the Wilmington facility and April 2008 for theJacksonville facility. Although the Company believes that its current relations with the laborunions and its unionized employees are satisfactory, any strikes or work stoppages organized by theunions, particularly the union representing certain employees at its Wilmington facility, couldreduce production and negatively affect its profitability. Although the Company has a contingencyplan to continue serving customers should it experience a disruption of production at any facility,there can be no assurances that a strike or work stoppage would not adversely impact the Companysoperating costs and reduce its earnings.The Companys operating costs and earnings could be negatively impacted by the continued escalationin medical costs.     Although the Company has implemented a number of measures to offset the impact of the ongoingescalation in medical costs, there can be no assurance that such actions will be effective goingforward. Continued increases in medical costs could potentially be substantial enough tosignificantly increase the Companys operating costs and reduce its earnings.Risks Related to Its Common StockThe Company may cease paying dividends in the future if its business environment, financialcondition or operating results materially decline or if its cash needs significantly increase.     In November 2000, as a result of economic pressure in the Companys industry and repeatedtechnical defaults on the Companys previous secured credit facility, the Company suspended itsquarterly cash dividend in connection with the terms ofa covenant waiver with its previous lenders. In June 2005, the Company amended its currentcredit agreement to increase the8 permitted amount of dividend payments to $3,500,000 in theaggregate in any fiscal year after fiscal 2005. In July 2005, as a result of an improved economicenvironment and corresponding improvement in the Companys financial condition and results ofoperations, the Company resumed its quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share. While the Companyintends to pay regular quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future, the declaration andpayment of future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of the Companys board of directorsafter taking into account various factors, including general business conditions and the Companysfinancial condition, operating results, cash needs, and expansion plans. In addition, the Companysability to pay future dividends is subject to compliance with the dividend restrictions andfinancial covenant limitations in the Companys Credit Agreement, as amended. There can be noassurances that the amount and frequency of current dividends will continue for any period of time.If the Company suspends dividends in the future, the value of the Companys common stock wouldlikely decrease and investors would be required to rely on sales of their common stock after priceappreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize value or income, if any, on theirinvestment.Anti-takeover provisions in the Companys organizational documents and North Carolina law make anychange in control more difficult. This could have an adverse affect on the price of the Companyscommon stock.     The Companys articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay orprevent a change in control, may discourage bids at a premium over the marketprice of its common stock and may have an adverse affect on the market price of its common stock aswell as the voting and other rights of the holders of its common stock. These provisions include:  the division of its Board of Directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms;   prohibiting its shareholders from calling a special meeting of shareholders;   the ability to issue additional shares of its common stock or preferred stock without shareholder approval;   the existence of a rights agreement, or poison pill, that results in thedilution of the value of its common stock held by a potential acquirer and forces anyacquirer to negotiate the potential acquisition of the Company with its Boardof Directors;   prohibiting its shareholders from amending its articles of incorporation orbylaws except with 66 2/3% shareholder approval; and   advance notice requirements for raising matters of business or makingnominations at shareholder meetings"
