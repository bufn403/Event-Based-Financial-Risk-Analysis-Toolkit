2,HE,HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC INDS,2024-02-29,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORSThe businesses of HEI and its subsidiaries involve numerous risks which, if realized, could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements. For additional information for certain risk factors enumerated below and other risks of the Company and its operations, see “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” above and HEI’s MD&A, HEI’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Hawaiian Electric’s MD&A and Hawaiian Electric’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”Holding company and company-wide risks.Potential losses resulting from the Maui windstorm and wildfires could have a material adverse effect on HEI’s and Hawaiian Electric’s financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and results of operations. On August 8, 2023, a number of brush fires in the West Maui (Lahaina) and Upcountry Maui areas caused widespread property damage, including damage to property of the Utilities, and 101 confirmed fatalities in Lahaina at this time (the Maui windstorm and wildfires). The Maui windstorm and wildfires were fueled by extreme winds and drought-like conditions in those parts of Maui. According to the Maui Police Department’s Preliminary After-Action Report, in addition to the loss of life, over 3,450 acres burned and over 3,000 structures were destroyed in those areas. In Lahaina, a fire was reported at about 6:30 a.m. (the “Morning Fire”) and appears to have been caused by power lines that fell in high winds and spread into a field near Lahaina Intermediate School. The Maui Fire Department responded promptly to the Morning Fire, and according to the Fire Department’s public statement that morning, by 9 a.m. the Morning Fire was “100% contained.” The Maui fire chief subsequently reported that the Fire Department had determined that the Morning Fire was “extinguished” and left the scene. Shortly before 3 p.m. that day, while the power remained off, Utility crew members saw a small fire in the same field about 75 yards away from Lahainaluna Road. They immediately called 911 and reported the fire (the “Afternoon Fire”). At the time of the Afternoon Fire, the Company’s power lines in the area where that fire ignited were not energized and had not been energized for more than six hours. By the time the Maui Fire Department arrived back on the scene, it was not able to contain the Afternoon Fire and it spread out of control toward Lahaina. No determination as to the cause of the Afternoon Fire has been made. The Company believes that most of the property damage and all of the fatalities are from the Afternoon Fire.  Multiple lawsuits have been filed against the Utilities and HEI alleging, among other things, that they were negligent in failing to prevent the wildfires that led to the property destruction and loss of life. If the Utilities and HEI are held responsible for damages caused by the Maui windstorm and wildfires, it could have a material impact on HEI’s and Hawaiian Electric’s financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and results of operations. The Company has $165 million in insurance coverage for third party claims, but the aggregate losses associated with the Maui windstorm and wildfires could significantly exceed that amount. Also, the Company is incurring legal and consulting fees to manage the lawsuits and financial implications related to the Maui windstorm and wildfires, and those amounts are likely to be material. HEI’s and Hawaiian Electric’s access to capital markets and other sources of debt and equity financings in a timely manner and on acceptable terms will continue to be negatively impacted as a result of the downgrades in their debt credit ratings to below investment grade.  In August 2023, HEI and Hawaiian Electric received multiple downgrades to their debt, including to ratings below investment grade, by Fitch, Moody’s and S&P. Unless and until these debt ratings are upgraded to investment grade, the Company will continue to have restricted access to capital markets and other sources of debt and equity financings, if at all, in a timely manner and on acceptable terms. Accordingly, the Company’s financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and results of operations may be adversely impacted if debt credit ratings are maintained at below investment grade for an extended period of time.  Extreme weather events and other natural disasters, particularly those exacerbated by climate change such as the Maui windstorm and wildfires, could materially affect Hawaiian Electric’s assets, particularly if they fail or are found to have contributed to a wildfire.  Extreme weather-related incidents and other natural disasters, including volcanic eruptions, mudslides, hurricanes, tsunamis and other storms, can interfere with the generation and transmission of electricity, and can seriously damage the infrastructure necessary to deliver electricity to customers. These risks are increasing, as climate change has exacerbated some of the conditions that lead to these extreme weather events and natural disasters. Such an event can result in lost revenue and increased expenses for the Utilities, but it also can result in regulatory penalties and disallowances if Hawaiian Electric is unable to restore power on a timely basis. Also, an extreme event can lead to significant claims for damages, including for loss of life and property, and has been the case with the Maui windstorm and wildfires. Therefore, these events could materially affect the Company’s business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.Holding Company Risk—HEI is a holding company that derives its income from its operating subsidiaries and depends on the ability of those subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI and on its own ability to raise capital.  HEI is a legal entity separate and distinct from its various subsidiaries. As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, HEI’s cash flows and consequent ability to service its obligations and pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon its receipt of dividends or other distributions from its operating subsidiaries and its ability to issue common stock or other 20equity securities and to incur additional debt. A material reduction or delay in dividends or other distributions by one or both of Hawaiian Electric and ASB for an extended period of time, such as a continuation or expansion of the reduction in dividends that HEI currently is experiencing due to the Maui windstorm and wildfires, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The ability of HEI’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI, in turn, is subject to the risks associated with their operations and to contractual and regulatory restrictions, including:•the provisions of an HEI agreement with the PUC, which could limit the ability of HEI’s principal electric public utility subsidiary, Hawaiian Electric, to pay dividends to HEI in the event that the consolidated common stock equity of the Utilities falls below 35% of total capitalization of the electric utilities;•the provisions of an HEI agreement entered into with federal bank regulators in connection with its acquisition of its bank subsidiary, ASB, which requires HEI to contribute additional capital to ASB (up to a maximum amount of additional capital of $28.3 million as of December 31, 2023 under the Regulatory Capital Maintenance/Dividend Agreement dated May 26, 1988, between HEI, HEIDI (HEI Diversified Inc.) and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation) upon request of the regulators in order to maintain ASB’s regulatory capital at the level required by regulation;•obligations under federal law and Federal Reserve Board policy, which require that a savings and loan holding company serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for any FDIC-insured depository institution that it controls, and accordingly, if ASB were to be in financial distress or to otherwise be viewed by the regulators as in unsatisfactory condition, HEI could be required to provide additional capital or liquidity support or take other action, in support of ASB. In addition, ASB may continue its suspension of its quarterly dividend to conserve cash to help ensure its maximum possible liquidity and capital position;•the minimum capital and capital distribution regulations of the OCC that are applicable to ASB and capital regulations that become applicable to HEI and ASB Hawaii;•the receipt of a letter from the FRB communicating the OCC’s and the FRB’s non-objection to the payment of any dividend ASB proposes to declare and pay to ASB Hawaii and HEI; and•the provisions of preferred stock resolutions and debt instruments of HEI and its subsidiaries.Credit and Capital Market Risk—The Company, and its lowered credit rating, is subject to risks associated with the Hawaii economy, including catastrophic events such as the Maui windstorm and wildfire (in the aggregate and on an individual island basis), volatile U.S. capital markets and changes in the interest rate and credit market environment that have or could result in higher retirement benefit plan funding requirements, declines in ASB’s interest rate margins and investment values, higher delinquencies and charge-offs in ASB’s loan portfolio and restrictions on the ability of HEI or its subsidiaries to borrow money or issue securities.  The two largest components of Hawaii’s economy are tourism and the federal government (including the military). Because the core businesses of HEI’s subsidiaries are providing local public electric utility services (through Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries) and banking services (through ASB) in Hawaii, the Company’s operating results are significantly influenced by: Hawaii’s economy, which in turn is influenced by economic conditions in the mainland U.S. (particularly California) and Asia (particularly Japan) as a result of the impact of those conditions on tourism; by the impact of interest rates on the construction and real estate industries and by the impact of federal government spending in Hawaii, which can be affected by world conditions; and, from time to time, the expiration of federal government appropriations bills. In addition, the Hawaii economy could be directly or indirectly affected by implications and potential impacts of U.S. and foreign capital and credit market conditions and federal, state and international responses to those conditions and the potential impacts of global and local developments (including economic conditions and uncertainties; unrest, terrorist acts, wars (such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas war), conflicts, political protests, deadly virus epidemic, pandemics, or other crisis; the effects of changes that have or may occur in U.S. policy, such as with respect to immigration and trade).HEI’s and Hawaiian Electric’s credit ratings only reflect the view, at the time the ratings are issued, of the applicable rating agency. There is no assurance that any such credit rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such rating will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agency if, in such rating agency’s judgment, circumstances, such as current, past or future effects or events so warrant. Any such lowering, suspension or withdrawal of any rating may have an adverse effect on the availability of capital to the Company or the market price or marketability of HEI’s and/or Hawaiian Electric’s securities, which could increase the cost of capital of HEI and Hawaiian Electric, and such increased costs, including interest charges, under HEI’s and/or Hawaiian Electric’s debt securities and credit facilities, would result in reductions in HEI’s consolidated net income in future periods. Because HEI’s and Hawaiian Electric’s credit ratings were downgraded, HEI and Hawaiian Electric are unable to sell commercial paper and were required to draw on more expensive bank lines of credit and to defer capital or other expenditures. Neither HEI nor Hawaiian Electric management can predict the duration of the downgrades and future rating agency actions or their effects on the future cost of capital of HEI or Hawaiian Electric. Such ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold any securities; such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies; and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.21Changes in the U.S. capital markets can also have significant effects on the Company. For example, pension funding requirements are affected by the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for pension plans, and by the discount rate used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost and value obligations. The Utilities’ pension tracking mechanisms help moderate pension expense; however, a significant reduction in the discount rate or in the value of the Company’s defined benefit pension plan assets could result in a substantial increase in the gap between the projected benefit obligations under the plans and the value of plan assets, resulting in increases in funding requirements.Because the earnings of ASB depend primarily on net interest income, interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASB’s operations. HEI and the Utilities are also exposed to interest rate risk primarily due to their periodic borrowing requirements, the discount rate used to determine pension funding requirements and the possible effect of interest rates on the electric utilities’ rates of return. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors, including general economic conditions and the policies of government and regulatory authorities. HEI cannot predict future changes in interest rates, nor be certain that interest rate risk management strategies it or its subsidiaries have implemented will be successful in managing interest rate risk.Interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting the fair value of ASB’s investment securities. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair values of those instruments, respectively. Disruptions in the credit markets, a liquidity crisis in the banking industry or increased levels of residential mortgage delinquencies and defaults may result in decreases in the fair value of ASB’s investment securities and an impairment, requiring ASB to write down its investment securities. As of December 31, 2023, ASB’s investment in U.S. Treasury and federal agency obligations, and mortgage-backed securities have an implicit guarantee from the U.S. government. Decreases in the fair value of ASB’s investment securities may also result in lower equity capital balances as unrealized losses in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio are recorded as a decrease in equity capital through accumulated other comprehensive losses. The lower equity capital balance could result in a lower tangible equity capital ratio and restrict ASB’s permissible activities if the tangible equity capital ratio falls below 2%. A negative tangible equity capital ratio would impact ASB’s availability to borrow funds from the FHLB of Des Moines.Geographic Concentration Risk—The Company is subject to the risks associated with the geographic concentration of its businesses and current lack of interconnections that could result in service interruptions at the Utilities or higher default rates on loans held by ASB.  The business of the Utilities is concentrated on the individual islands they serve in the State of Hawaii. Their operations are more vulnerable to service interruptions than that of many U.S. mainland utilities because none of the systems of the Utilities are interconnected with the systems on the other islands they serve. Because of this lack of interconnections, it is necessary to maintain higher generation reserve margins than are typical for U.S. mainland utilities to help ensure reliable service. Service interruptions, including, in particular, extended interruptions that could result from a natural disaster or terrorist activity, could adversely impact the revenues and costs of some or all of the Utilities.Substantially all of ASB’s consumer loan customers are Hawaii residents. A significant portion of the commercial loan customers are also located in Hawaii. While a majority of customers are on Oahu, ASB also has customers on the neighbor islands (whose economies are smaller and less diverse than Oahu’s economy). Substantially all of the real estate underlying ASB’s residential and commercial real estate loans are located in Hawaii. These assets may be subject to a greater risk of default due to geographic concentration than other comparable assets held by financial institutions with more diverse geographic exposure in the event of adverse economic, political or business developments or natural disasters affecting Hawaii and affect the ability of ASB’s customers to make payments of principal and interest on their loans.Competitive and Technological Risk—Increasing competition and technological advances could cause HEI’s businesses to lose customers or render their operations obsolete.  The banking industry in Hawaii, and certain aspects of the electric utility industry, are competitive. The success of HEI’s subsidiaries in meeting competition and responding to technological advances will continue to have a direct impact on HEI’s consolidated financial performance. For example:•ASB, one of the largest financial institutions in the state, is in direct competition for deposits and loans not only with two larger institutions that have substantial capital, technology and marketing resources, but also with smaller Hawaii institutions and other U.S. institutions, including credit unions, mutual funds, mortgage brokers, finance companies, non-traditional providers of financial services and investment banking firms. Larger financial institutions may have greater access to capital at lower costs, which could impair ASB’s ability to compete effectively. New or significant advances in technology (e.g., significant advances in internet or mobile banking) or customer adoption of alternative banking channels could render the operations of ASB less competitive or obsolete. •The Utilities face competition from IPPs; customer self-generation, with or without cogeneration; customer energy storage; and the potential formation of community-based, cooperative ownership or municipality structures for electrical service on all islands it serves. With the exception of certain identified projects, the Utilities are required to use competitive bidding to acquire a future generation resource unless the PUC finds competitive bidding to be unsuitable. The PUC sets policies for distributed generation interconnection agreements and standby rates. The results 22of competitive bidding, competition from IPPs, customer self-generation, and potential cooperative ownership or municipality structures for electric utility service, and the rate at which technological developments facilitating nonutility generation of electricity, combined heat and power technology, off-grid microgrids, and customer energy storage may render the operations of the Utilities less competitive or outdated and adversely affect the Utilities and the results of their operations. Cybersecurity Risk—The Company is subject to information technology and operational system failures, network disruptions, cyber attacks and breaches in data security that could materially and adversely affect its businesses and reputation.  The Company and its subsidiaries rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed or hosted by third party service providers, to manage its business data, communications, and other business processes. Such information technology systems are vulnerable to cyberattacks or other security incidents, which could result in unauthorized access to confidential data, ransomware demands or disruptions to operations. In addition, there is increasing cybersecurity risk associated with the broad adoption of a remote working environment. If the Company is unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve an incident, it may have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.Utilities.  The Utilities rely on evolving and complex operational and information systems, networks and other technologies, which are interconnected with the systems and network infrastructure owned by third parties to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, invoicing and collection of payments, customer relationship management, human resource management, the acquisition, generation and delivery of electrical service to customers, and to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting and legal and tax requirements. The Utilities use their systems and infrastructure to create, collect, store, and process sensitive information, including personal information regarding customers, employees and their dependents, retirees, and other individuals. Their systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access caused by natural disasters, cybersecurity incidents, security breaches, user error, unintentional defects created by system changes, military or terrorist actions, nation-state threat actors, criminal organizations, power or communication failures or similar events. Any such failure could have a material adverse impact on the Utilities’ ability to process transactions and provide service, as well the Utilities’ financial condition and results of operations. Further, a data breach involving theft, improper disclosure, or other unauthorized access to or acquisition of confidential information could subject the Utilities to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, claims by third parties, and enforcement actions by government agencies. A data breach could also reduce the value of proprietary information, and harm the reputation of the Utilities.Private and public entities, such as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and the U.S. federal government, including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Energy, and the White House, have noted that cyberattacks targeting utility systems are increasing in sophistication, magnitude, and frequency. The Utilities’ systems have been, and will likely continue to be, a target of attacks. Further, the Utilities’ operational networks may be subject to unforeseen operational/cybersecurity risks due to the reliance on legacy operational components or modernizing and interconnecting existing infrastructure with new technologies and control systems, including those owned by third parties, such as independent power producers, distributed energy resource aggregators and customers. Although the Utilities have not experienced a material cybersecurity breach to date, such incidents may occur and may have a material adverse effect on the Utilities and the Company in the future. The Utilities continue to make investments in their cybersecurity program, including personnel, technologies, cyber insurance and training of Utilities personnel; however, there can be no assurance that these systems or their expected functionality will be implemented, maintained, or expanded effectively; nor can security measures completely eliminate the possibility of a cybersecurity breach. The Utilities maintain cyber liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents. However, there is no guarantee that adequate insurance will continue to be available at rates the Utilities believe are reasonable or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates. If the Utilities’ operational technologies or networks were to malfunction or fail or cybersecurity measures were to be breached, the Utilities could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to their reputations.Due to the size, scope and complexity of the Utilities’ business, the development and maintenance of information technology systems to process and track information is critical and challenging. The Utilities often rely on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems and these third-party vendors could cease to exist, fail to establish adequate processes to protect the Utilities systems and information, experience supply chain compromises or other internal or external security incidents. In addition, the Utilities are pursuing complex business transformation initiatives, which include the implementation of new systems and the upgrade or replacement of existing systems. Significant system changes increase the risk of system interruptions, which may occur. Further, delay or failure to complete the integration of information systems and processes may result in delays in regulatory cost recovery, or the failure to realize the benefits anticipated to be derived from these initiatives.23The Utilities’ disaster recovery plans may not be successful in preventing the loss of customer data, service interruptions and disruptions to operations or damage to important facilities. If any of these systems fail to operate properly or become disabled and the Utilities’ disaster recovery plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, the Utilities could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to their reputations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities’ and the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.ASB.  ASB is highly dependent on its ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions and relies heavily on communication and information systems, including those of third-party vendors and other service providers.  If any of these systems fail to operate properly or become disabled even for a brief period of time, ASB could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to its reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on ASB’s and the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.  Communication and information system failures can result from a variety of risks including, but not limited to, events that are wholly or partially out of ASB’s control, such as communication line integrity, weather, terrorist acts, natural disasters, accidental disasters, unauthorized breaches of security systems, energy delivery systems, cyberattacks and other events.ASB is under continuous threat of loss due to cyberattacks, especially as ASB continues to expand customer capabilities to utilize the Internet and other digital channels to transact business. Two of the most significant cyberattack risks that ASB faces are e-fraud and loss of sensitive customer data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals extract funds directly from ASB or its customers’ accounts using fraudulent schemes that may include Internet-based funds transfers. ASB has been subject to e-fraud incidents historically. Loss of sensitive customer data are attempts to steal sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, through unauthorized access to computer systems, including computer hacking. Such attacks could present significant reputational, legal and regulatory costs if successful. Intrusion detection and prevention systems, anti-virus software, firewalls and other general information technology controls have been put in place to help detect and prevent cyberattacks or information system breaches. Disaster recovery and incident response plans have been developed to respond to unplanned incidents such as natural disasters, cyberattacks and other disruptive events. However there can be no assurance that failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately protected or recovered by ASB or its vendors.Despite the security measures we have implemented, certain cyber incidents could materially disrupt operational systems; result in loss of trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information; compromise personally identifiable information regarding customers or employees; delay our ability to deliver products to customers; and/or jeopardize the security of our facilities. Additionally unauthorized access to our computer systems or stored data could result in the theft, including cyber-theft, or improper disclosure of confidential information, and the deletion or modification of records could cause interruptions in our operations.Further, a data breach involving theft, improper disclosure, or other unauthorized access to or acquisition of confidential information could subject the Bank to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, claims by third parties, and enforcement actions by government agencies. In addition, ASB’s operational systems may be subject to new cybersecurity risks due to modernizing and interconnecting existing infrastructure with new technologies and control systems, including those owned by third parties. Although ASB has not experienced a material cybersecurity breach to date, such incidents may occur and may have a material adverse effect on the Bank should a material incident occur.Uninsured Losses—HEI’s businesses could suffer losses that are uninsured due to a lack of affordable insurance coverage, unavailability of insurance coverage or limitations on the insurance coverage the Company does have.  In the ordinary course of business, HEI and its subsidiaries purchase insurance coverages (e.g., property and liability coverages) to protect against loss of, or damage to, their properties and against claims made by third parties and employees for property damage or personal injuries. However, the protection provided by such insurance is limited in significant respects and, in some instances, there is no coverage. Some of the insurance coverages have substantial deductibles or has limits on the maximum amounts that may be recovered. In common with other companies in its line of business, the Utilities’ overhead and underground transmission and distribution systems (with the exception of substation buildings and contents), which have a replacement value roughly estimated at $12 billion, are largely not insured against loss or damage because the amount of transmission and distribution system insurance capacity is limited and the premiums are cost prohibitive. Similarly, the Utilities have no business interruption insurance as the premiums for such insurance would be cost prohibitive, particularly since the Utilities are not interconnected to other systems. If a hurricane or other uninsured catastrophic natural disaster were to occur, and if the PUC did not allow the affected Utilities to recover from ratepayers restoration costs and revenues lost from business interruption, the lost revenues and repair expenses could result in a significant decrease in HEI’s consolidated net income or in significant net losses for the affected periods.Related to damages and costs incurred as a result of the Maui windstorm and wildfires, the Company has property insurance with a total policy limit of $500 million, subject to a $1 million retention, for wildfire damages related to Utility-owned non-generating assets, including overhead transmission and distribution assets within 1,000 feet of such assets. The 24Company also has $165 million of excess liability insurance, subject to a $0.3 million retention, for third party claims including claims related to wildfires, and $145 million directors and officers liability insurance, subject to a $1.0 million retention, to cover claims related to shareholder and derivative lawsuits. The aggregate damages and costs associated with the Maui windstorm and wildfires could significantly exceed the Company’s policy limits.ASB generally does not obtain credit enhancements, such as mortgagor bankruptcy insurance, but does require standard hazard and hurricane insurance and may require flood insurance for certain properties. ASB is subject to the risks of borrower defaults and bankruptcies, special hazard losses not covered by the required insurance and the insurance company’s inability to pay claims on existing policies.Environmental Regulation—Increased federal and state environmental regulation will require an increasing commitment of resources and funds and could result in construction delays or penalties and fines for non-compliance.  HEI and its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, hazardous substances, waste management, natural resources and health and safety, which regulate, among other matters, the operation of existing facilities, the construction and operation of new facilities and the proper cleanup and disposal of hazardous and toxic wastes and substances. These laws and regulations could result in increased capital, operating, and other costs. HEI or its subsidiaries are currently involved in investigatory or remedial actions at current, former or third-party sites and there is no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs relating to these sites. In addition, compliance with these legal requirements requires the Utilities to commit significant resources and funds toward, among other things, environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment and payment of emission fees. These laws and regulations, among other things, require that certain environmental permits be obtained in order to construct or operate certain facilities, and obtaining such permits can entail significant expense and cause substantial construction delays. Also, these laws and regulations may be amended from time to time, including amendments that increase the burden and cost of compliance. For example, emission and/or discharge limits may be tightened, more extensive permitting requirements may be imposed and additional substances may become regulated. In addition, significant regulatory uncertainty exists regarding the impact of federal or state greenhouse gas emission limits and reductions.If HEI or its subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond their control, that failure may result in civil or criminal penalties and fines or the cessation of operations that could have a material adverse on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Electric utility risks.    The following risks are generally specific to Hawaiian Electric, but could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Regulatory Risk—Actions of the PUC are outside the control of the Utilities and could result in inadequate or untimely rate increases, rate reductions or refunds or unanticipated delays, expenses or writedowns in connection with the construction of new projects.  The rates the Utilities are allowed to charge for their services and the timeliness of permitted rate increases are among the most important items influencing the Utilities’ results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The PUC has broad discretion over the rates that the Utilities charge their customers. On December 23, 2020, as part of the D&O establishing the PBR Framework, the PUC established a five-year Multi-year Rate Period (MRP) during which there will be no general rate cases. In the fourth year of the MRP, the PUC will comprehensively review the PBR Framework to determine if any modifications or revisions are appropriate. Any adverse decision by the PUC concerning the level or method of determining electric utility rates at the end of the MRP, including the items and amounts that may be included in rate base, the returns on equity or rate base found to be reasonable, the potential consequences of exceeding or not meeting such returns, the denial of exceptional project recovery applications during the MRP, adverse impact of adjustments made to the PBR Framework, decisions on recovery of exogenous items under the PBR Framework, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding could have a material adverse effect on Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.To improve the timing and certainty of the recovery of their costs, the Utilities have proposed and/or received approval of various cost recovery mechanisms, including an ECRC (includes a PUC-ordered 98%/2% risk-sharing split between customers and the Utilities for fossil fuel price variations from baseline prices, with a current annual aggregate exposure cap of +/- $3.7 million), a PPAC, and pension and OPEB tracking mechanisms, as well as a decoupling mechanism, an exceptional project recovery mechanism (EPRM) (formerly Major Project Interim Recovery (MPIR) adjustment mechanism), and a Renewable Energy Infrastructure Program surcharge. A change in, or the elimination of, any of these cost recovery mechanisms, could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities. See “Regulatory mechanisms” in Electric Utility’s Business.Under the PBR Framework, the Utilities’ annual revenue adjustment (ARA) includes a customer dividend consisting of a negative adjustment of 0.22% compounded annually and a flow through of the “pre-PBR” savings commitment from the 25management audit recommendations developed in the 2020 test year rate case. The ability of the Utilities to recover increasing costs and earn a reasonable return on capital investments not covered by the ARA or not achieving the customer dividend and cost savings commitment could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities. Under the PBR Framework, the existing PIMs continue, and the PUC established new PIMs and is working on additional PIMs with stakeholders. The assessment of penalties for not achieving performance goals or the failure to achieve PIMs rewards could affect the Utilities’ ability to achieve their allowed ROACEs and have a material adverse effect on the Utilities. Related to the Maui windstorm and wildfires, the Utilities received PUC approval to temporarily suspend Maui Electric’s Transmission and Distribution (T&D) System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) and System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) PIMs from August 8, 2023 through June 30, 2024. If the temporary suspension of Maui Electric’s T&D PIMs is not extended beyond June 30, 2024, Maui Electric’s maximum annual penalty for T&D SAIDI and SAIFI could have a $0.4 million impact on the Utilities’ results of operations. The Utilities also obtained PUC approval to defer certain non-labor expenses incurred from August 8, 2023 through December 31, 2024 that are not already a part of base rates. If the PUC denies recovery of any deferred costs, such costs would be charged to expense in the period that those costs are no longer considered probable of recovery. Additionally, on August 31, 2023, the PUC issued an order temporarily suspending the ESM until further notice. The intent of the order is to address the unintended consequence of customers potentially bearing the costs associated with the Maui windstorm and wildfires through the operation of the ESM without prior PUC review. See “Performance-based regulation framework” and “Regulatory assets for Maui windstorm and wildfires related costs” in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.Based on the current operations of the Utilities and regulatory framework, including the impact of the approved PBR Framework, the Utilities continue to follow regulatory accounting under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 980. Continued accounting in this manner requires that certain criteria relating to the recoverability of such costs through rates be met, including achieved financial results that support the recovery of costs. If events or circumstances should change, such that the criteria are no longer satisfied, the Utilities expect that their regulatory assets (amounting to $295 million as of December 31, 2023), net of regulatory liabilities (amounting to $1,151 million as of December 31, 2023), would be charged to the statement of income in the period of discontinuance. See “Performance-based regulation framework” in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.The Utilities could be required to refund to their customers, with interest, revenues that have been or may be received under interim rate orders in their rate case proceedings and other proceedings, if and to the extent they exceed the amounts allowed in final orders.Many public utility projects require PUC approval and various permits (e.g., environmental and land use permits) from other governmental agencies. Difficulties in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, the necessary approvals or permits, or any adverse decision or policy made or adopted, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision, by an agency with respect to such approvals and permits, can result in significantly increased project costs or even cancellation of projects. In the event a project does not proceed, or if the PUC disallows cost recovery for all or part of a project, or if project costs exceed caps imposed by the PUC in its approval of the project, project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could result in significant reductions in Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated net income. Weather Conditions Risk—Electric utility operations are significantly influenced by weather conditions and natural disasters.  The Utilities’ results of operations can be affected by the weather and natural disasters. Weather conditions, particularly temperature and humidity, directly influence the demand for electricity. Additionally, severe weather and natural disasters may become more intense and/or frequent because of global climate changes. Recent natural disasters such as the Kilauea eruption in 2018, Mauna Loa eruption in 2022, and the Maui windstorm and wildfires in 2023, resulted in disruption or destruction of electric utility operations. When these types of events occur, they can cause outages and property damage and require the Utilities to incur significant additional expenses that may not be recoverable.Climate Change Risk—Electric utility operations may be significantly influenced by climate change.  While the timing, extent and ultimate effects of climate change cannot be determined with any certainty, climate change is predicted to result in sea level rise, which could potentially impact coastal and other low-lying areas (where much of the Utilities’ electric infrastructure is sited), and could cause erosion of beaches, saltwater intrusion into aquifers and surface ecosystems, higher water tables and increased flooding and storm damage due to heavy rainfall. The effects of climate change on the weather (for example, floods, hurricanes, heat waves or drought conditions, the latter of which could increase wildfire risk), sea levels, and water availability and quality, all have the potential to materially adversely affect the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities. For example, severe weather and its related impacts could cause significant harm to the Utilities’ physical facilities. Third Party Performance Risk—Electric utility operations depend heavily on third-party suppliers of fuel and purchased power.  The Utilities rely on fuel suppliers and shippers, and IPPs to deliver fuel and power, respectively, in accordance with 26contractual agreements. Approximately 79% of the net energy generated or purchased by the Utilities in 2023 was generated from the burning of fossil fuel oil, and purchases of power by the Utilities provided about 38% of their total net energy generated and purchased for the same period. Failure or delay by fuel suppliers and shippers to provide fuel pursuant to existing contracts, or failure by a major IPP to deliver the firm capacity anticipated in its PPA, could disrupt the ability of the Utilities to deliver electricity, affect the Utilities’ maintenance schedules that could affect future reliability and require the Utilities to incur additional expenses to meet the needs of their customers that may not be recoverable. In addition, as the IPP contracts near the end of their terms, there may be less economic incentive for the IPPs to make investments in their units to ensure the availability of their units. Also, as these contractual agreements end, the Utilities may not be able to purchase fuel and power on terms equivalent to the current contractual agreements.Capacity Risk—The capacity provided by the Utilities’ generating resources and third-party purchased power may not be sufficient to meet customers’ energy requirements.  The Utilities rely upon their generating resources and purchased power from third parties to meet their customers’ energy requirements. The Utilities update their generation capacity evaluation each year to determine the Utilities’ ability to meet reasonably expected demands for service and provide reasonable reserves for emergencies and other unplanned events. These evaluations are impacted by a variety of factors, including customer energy demand, energy conservation and efficiency initiatives, economic conditions, and weather patterns. If the capacity provided by the Utilities’ generating resources and third-party purchased power is not adequate relative to customer demand, the Utilities may have to contract to buy more power from third parties, invest in additional generating facilities over the long-term, or extend the operating life of existing utility units. Any failure to meet customer energy requirements could negatively impact the satisfaction of the Utilities’ customers, which could have an adverse impact on the Utilities’ business, reputation and results of operations. Related to the Maui windstorm and wildfires, the Utilities continue to expect potential generation shortfalls on Maui in 2024. The Energy Reserve Margin, the planning criteria used to determine generation adequacy, is the percentage which the system generation capacity must exceed the system load in each hour. The Utilities’ Energy Reserve Margin analysis indicates shortfalls in 2024, but is satisfied from 2025 through 2028 with the addition of planned generation and storage resource additions. The Utilities have plans to address this issue in 2024 through managing maintenance schedules of existing generations, and if necessary, may request for voluntary customer conservation during periods of high power demands. The environment for resource planning has increased in complexity and uncertainty and the Utilities will continue using a portfolio approach to meet its obligation to serve. This includes increased renewable energy, energy storage, and other potential options, both supply side and customer programs. If the Utilities are unable to meet customer energy requirements, it could negatively impact the satisfaction of the Utilities’ customers, which could have an adverse impact on the Utilities’ business, reputation and results of operations.Stakeholder Activism Risk—Electric utility and third-party purchased power projects may be significantly impacted by stakeholder activism.  The potential impact of stakeholder activism could increase total utility project costs, and delay the permitting, construction and overall timing or preclude the completion of third-party or utility projects that are required to meet electricity demand, resilience and reliability objectives, and RPS and other climate related goals. If a utility project cannot be completed, the project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could result in significant reductions in Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated net income and negatively impact its financial condition and liquidity. Operational Risk—Electric utility generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated and/or increased operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs.  Operation of electric generating facilities involves certain risks which can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels. Included among these risks are facility shutdowns or power interruptions due to insufficient generation or a breakdown or failure of equipment or processes. In addition, operations could be negatively impacted by interruptions in fuel supply, inability to negotiate satisfactory collective bargaining agreements when existing agreements expire or other labor disputes, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements, disruptions in delivery of electricity, operator error, adverse weather or environmental conditions and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, fires, explosions, lava flows, floods or other similar occurrences affecting the Utilities’ generating facilities or transmission and distribution systems.Legislative Risk—The Utilities may be adversely affected by new legislation or administrative actions.  Congress, the Hawaii legislature and governmental agencies periodically consider legislation and other initiatives that could have uncertain or negative effects on the Utilities and their customers. Congress, the Hawaii legislature and governmental agencies have adopted, or are considering adopting, a number of measures that will significantly affect the Utilities, as described below.Renewable Portfolio Standards law.  The 2001 Hawaii Legislature adopted a law requiring the Utilities to meet a renewable portfolio standard, which has been amended over the years. The most recent amendment to Hawaii’s RPS law occurred in July 2022, which Governor Ige signed Act 240 (H.B.2089), that amended the RPS calculation from renewable energy as a percentage of sales to renewable energy as a percentage of total generation. The amended RPS calculation results in a lower calculated percentage than the amount calculated under the previous methodology. The change in the definition is to be 27applied prospectively to future milestone measurements and will require that the Utilities acquire more renewable energy than under the previous RPS calculation to comply with the RPS milestones. The Utilities are committed to achieving these goals and met the 2015 and 2020 RPS; however, due to the exclusion of energy savings in calculating RPS after 2014 and risks such as potential delays in IPPs being able to deliver contracted renewable energy, it is possible the Utilities may not attain the required renewable percentages in the future, and management cannot predict the future consequences of failure to do so (including potential penalties to be assessed by the PUC). On December 19, 2008, the PUC approved a penalty of $20 for every megawatt-hour (MWh) that an electric utility is deficient under Hawaii’s RPS law. The PUC noted, however, that this penalty may be reduced, in the PUC’s discretion, due to events or circumstances that are outside an electric utility’s reasonable control, to the extent the event or circumstance could not be reasonably foreseen and ameliorated, as described in the RPS law and in an RPS framework adopted by the PUC. In addition, the PUC ordered that the Utilities will be prohibited from recovering any RPS penalty costs through rates.Renewable energy.  In 2007, a measure was passed by the Hawaii legislature stating that the PUC may consider the need for increased renewable energy in rendering decisions on utility matters. Due to this measure, it is possible that, if energy from a renewable source is more expensive than energy from fossil fuel, the PUC may still approve the purchase of energy from the renewable source, resulting in higher costs.Global climate change and greenhouse gas emissions reduction.  National and international concern about climate change and the contribution of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (including carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels) to climate change have led to federal legislative and regulatory proposals and action by the state of Hawaii to reduce GHG emissions. In July 2007, the State Legislature passed Act 234, which requires a statewide reduction of GHG emissions by January 1, 2020 to levels at or below the statewide GHG emission levels in 1990. On June 20, 2014, the Governor signed the final rules required to implement Act 234 and these rules went into effect on June 30, 2014. In general, Act 234 and the GHG rule require affected sources that have the potential to emit GHGs in excess of established thresholds to reduce their GHG emissions by 16% below 2010 emission levels by 2020. In accordance with state requirements, the Utilities submitted an Emissions Reduction Plan (ERP) to the State of Hawaii Department of Health on June 30, 2015, with the most recent revision filed on June 9, 2020, to reflect the partnership established between the Utilities and several IPPs. In this plan, the partnership committed to a 16% reduction in GHG emissions in accordance with the rule, which the partnership achieved in 2017 in advance of the 2020 requirement. The State of Hawaii Department of Health issued the air permits incorporating the ERP, including provisions to address the period of unavailability of the PGV facility on Hawaii Island. It is expected that with the advent of additional renewable projects and the application to the PUC with respect to the expansion of the PPA for the PGV project, the goals should be attainable. Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 269-6(b) requires that “in making determinations of the reasonableness of the costs pertaining to electric or gas utility system capital improvements and operations, the PUC shall explicitly consider, quantitatively or qualitatively, the effect of the state’s reliance on fossil fuels on price volatility, export of funds for fuel imports, fuel supply reliability risk, and greenhouse gas emissions.” Based on HRS § 269-6(b) and recent case law discussing the scope of this section, the Utilities are performing GHG analyses to quantitatively or qualitatively describe the GHG emissions of proposed projects that are submitted to the PUC for approval.In June 2018, House Bill 2182 was signed into law as Act 15 and took effect on July 1, 2018. Among its provisions, Act 15 aligned the state’s clean energy and carbon sequestration efforts with climate initiative goals and established a statewide carbon neutral goal by 2045. Under this Act, efforts would be made to “sequester more atmospheric carbon and greenhouse gases than emitted within the state as quickly as practicable, but no later than 2045.” The Hawaii Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission, administratively placed under the State Department of Land and Natural Resources, was charged with endeavoring to achieve the target, and giving consideration to the impact of its plans, decisions and strategies on the state’s ability to attain the goal. The general functions, duties and powers of the Hawaii Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission are set forth in HRS § 225P-3. To achieve its mandates, the Hawaii Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission may recommend plans, decisions and strategies that could have an impact on various entities including the Utilities. In July 2022, House Bill 1800 was signed into law as Act 238 and took effect on July 1, 2022. The Act established a goal for the statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit to be at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030.The Utilities have taken, and continue to identify opportunities to take, direct action to reduce GHG emissions from their operations, including, but not limited to, supporting demand-side management programs that foster energy efficiency, using renewable resources for energy production and purchasing power from IPPs generated by renewable resources, and burning renewable biodiesel at selected Hawaiian Electric and Maui Electric generating units. In November 2021, the Utilities committed to a 70% reduction in power generation GHG emissions by 2030 compared to a 2005 baseline and achievement of net zero carbon emissions from power generation by 2045. While the reduction is not mandated by law, the Utilities could suffer reputational harm if it fails to achieve its commitments, which may negatively impact its business. Since the time the 282030 goal was established, delays and cancellations in the commercial operation of new renewable third-party generation resources and higher costs as a result of supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures, as well as federal policies related to solar panel imports, have slowed the pace of progress toward reducing GHG emissions. The downgrade of Hawaiian Electric’s credit ratings after the Maui windstorm and wildfires is anticipated to be an additional impediment to completion of new renewable energy and storage projects. As a result of these challenges, the Utilities expect the planned 70% reduction in carbon emissions to be achieved later than the original 2030 target date. However, the Utilities will continue to replace significant amounts of fossil fuel generation with renewable energy between now and 2030 and expect to meet or exceed the State of Hawaii’s RPS goals.The foregoing legislation or legislation that now is, or may in the future be, proposed, such as potential carbon “cap and trade” legislation that, if applicable, may fundamentally alter costs to produce electricity and accelerate the move to renewable generation, present risks and uncertainties for the Utilities.Renewable Transition Risk—The Utilities may be subject to increased operational challenges and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely impacted in meeting the commitments and objectives of clean energy initiatives, Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) and other climate related goals.  The far-reaching nature of the Utilities’ renewable energy commitments and the RPS and other climate related goals present risks to the Company. Among such risks are: (1) the potential delay by the Public Utilities Commission of the State of Hawaii (PUC) in considering (and potential disapproval of actual or proposed) renewable energy proposals and related costs; (2) the dependence on outside parties, such as the state, developers and third-party suppliers of renewable purchased energy, which if the Utilities are unsuccessful in negotiating purchased power agreements with such IPPs or if a major IPP delays or fails to deliver the anticipated capacity and/or energy in its purchased power agreement, could impact the Utilities’ achievement of their commitments to RPS and other climate related goals, eligibility for performance incentive mechanisms associated with the speed of increasing renewable generation, the ability to retire fossil fuel units, and/or the Utilities’ ability to deliver reliable service; (3) delays in acquiring or unavailability of non-fossil fuel supplies for renewable generation; (4) the impact of intermittent power to the electrical grid and reliability of service if appropriate supporting infrastructure is not installed or does not operate effectively; (5) the inability to recover the undepreciated cost of fossil fuel generating units if they are required to be retired before the end of their expected useful life; (6) uncertainties surrounding current and future renewable technologies, such as solar power, wind power, biofuels, battery storage, hydro, hydrogen, as well as related environmental assessments required to meet RPS and other climate related goals; (7) the impacts of implementation of the renewable energy proposals on future costs of electricity and potential penalties imposed by the PUC for delays in the commercial operations of renewable energy projects; (8) the likelihood that the Utilities may need to make substantial investments in related infrastructure, which could result in increased borrowings and, therefore, materially impact the financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities; (9) the imputed debt related to the pending renewable power purchase agreements under the stage 1, stage 2, stage 3 and other RFPs could result in a credit rating downgrade for the Utilities and the Company; and (10) the commitment to support a variety of initiatives, which, if approved by the PUC, may have a material impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the Utilities depending on their design and implementation. These initiatives include, but are not limited to, programs to enable more customer-sited generation. The implementation of these or other programs may adversely impact the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities.Bank risks.The following risks are generally specific to ASB, but could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Interest Rate Risk—Fluctuations in interest rates could result in lower net interest income, impair ASB’s ability to originate new loans, impair the ability of ASB’s adjustable-rate borrowers to make increased payment obligations or impact ASB’s ability to attract and retain deposits.  Interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASB’s operations. ASB’s net interest income consists primarily of interest income received on fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, mortgage-backed securities and investments, less interest expense consisting primarily of interest paid on deposits and other borrowings. Interest rate risk arises when earning assets mature or reprice in a time frame different from that of costing liabilities. Changes in interest rates, including changes in the relationship between short-term and long-term tenors (e.g., a flat or an inverted yield curve) or between different interest rate indices, can impact ASB’s net interest margin. See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.” Although ASB pursues an asset-liability management strategy designed to mitigate its risk from changes in interest rates, adverse movements in interest rates could result in lower net interest income or net interest margin. Residential 1-4 family fixed-rate mortgage loans comprised about 37% of ASB’s loan portfolio as of December 31, 2023.  Increases in market interest rates could have an adverse impact on ASB’s cost of funds. Higher market interest rates could lead to higher interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Significant increases in market interest rates, or the perception that an increase may occur, could adversely affect ASB’s ability to originate new loans. An increase in market interest rates, especially a sudden increase, 29similar to the rapid federal funds rate increases experienced in 2022, could also adversely affect the ability of ASB’s adjustable-rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations. If this occurred, it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets and charge-offs. Conversely, a decrease in interest rates or a mismatching of maturities of interest sensitive financial instruments could result in an acceleration in the prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities and impact ASB’s ability to reinvest its liquidity in similar yielding assets.ASB relies on customer deposits as a sizable source of relatively stable and low-cost funding. Changes in interest rates impact the interest paid on deposits and can significantly impact the Bank’s net interest income and net interest margin. Changes in interest rates may also impact the level of low-cost core deposits that the Bank’s customers maintain in their accounts, which may require ASB to seek higher costing wholesale borrowings.Credit Risk—ASB’s allowance for credit losses may not cover actual loan losses.  ASB’s allowance for credit losses is ASB’s estimate of lifetime expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit and is based on a continuing assessment of:•existing risks in the loan portfolio;•historical loss experience with ASB’s loans;•changes in collateral value; •current conditions (for example, economic conditions, real estate market conditions and interest rate environment); and•reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount.If ASB’s actual loan losses exceed its allowance for credit losses, it may incur losses, its financial condition may be materially and adversely affected, and additional capital may be required to enhance its capital position. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, regularly review the adequacy of ASB’s allowance. These agencies may require ASB to establish additional allowances based on their judgment of the information available at the time of their examinations. No assurance can be given that ASB will not sustain loan losses in excess of present or future levels of its allowance for credit losses.Operational Risk—ASB’s operations are affected by factors that are beyond its control, that could result in lower revenues, higher expenses or decreased demand for its products and services.  ASB’s results of operations depend primarily on the income generated by the supply of, and demand for, its products and services, which primarily consist of loans and deposit services. ASB also generates income from other non-deposit products and services.  ASB’s revenues and expenses may be adversely affected by various factors, including:•local, regional, national and other economic and political conditions that could result in declines in employment and real estate values, which in turn could adversely affect the ability of borrowers to make loan payments and the ability of ASB to recover the full amounts owing to it under defaulted loans;•the ability of borrowers to obtain insurance and the ability of ASB to place insurance where borrowers fail to do so, particularly in the event of catastrophic damage to collateral securing loans made by ASB;•faster than expected loan prepayments that can cause an acceleration of the amortization of premiums on loans and investments and the impairment of mortgage servicing assets of ASB;•changes in ASB’s loan portfolio credit profiles and asset quality, which may increase or decrease the required level of allowance for credit losses;•technological disruptions affecting ASB’s operations or financial or operational difficulties experienced by any outside vendor on whom ASB relies to provide key components of its business operations, such as business processing, network access or internet connections;•events of default and foreclosure of loans whereby ASB becomes the owner of mortgage properties that presents environmental risk or potential clean up liability;•the impact of legislative and regulatory changes, including changes affecting capital requirements, increasing oversight of and reporting by banks, or affecting the lending programs or other business activities of ASB;•additional legislative changes regulating the assessment of overdraft, interchange and credit card fees, which can have a negative impact on noninterest income;•public opinion about ASB and financial institutions in general, which, if negative, could impact the public’s trust and confidence in ASB and adversely affect ASB’s ability to attract and retain customers and expose ASB to adverse legal and regulatory consequences;•increases in operating costs (including employee compensation expense and benefits and regulatory compliance costs), inflation and other factors, that exceed increases in ASB’s net interest, fee and other income; and•the ability of ASB to maintain or increase the level of deposits, ASB’s lowest costing funds.30Banking Regulatory Risk—Banking and related regulations could result in significant restrictions being imposed on ASB’s business or in a requirement that HEI divest ASB.  ASB is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the Department of Treasury, the OCC and the FDIC, and is subject to reserve requirements established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In addition, the FRB is responsible for regulating ASB’s holding companies, HEI and ASB Hawaii. The regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies to address not only ASB’s compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations, but also capital adequacy, asset quality, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity and various other factors.Under certain circumstances, including any determination that ASB’s relationship with HEI results in an unsafe and unsound banking practice, these regulatory authorities have the authority to restrict the ability of ASB to transfer assets and to make distributions to its shareholders (including payment of dividends to HEI), or they could seek to require HEI to sever its relationship with or divest its ownership of ASB. Payment by ASB of dividends to HEI may also be restricted by the OCC and FRB under its prompt corrective action regulations or its capital distribution regulations if ASB’s capital position deteriorates. In order to maintain its status as a QTL, ASB is required to maintain at least 65% of its assets in “qualified thrift investments.” Institutions that fail to maintain QTL status are subject to various penalties, including limitations on their activities. In ASB’s case, the activities of HEI and HEI’s other subsidiaries would also be subject to restrictions, and a failure or inability to comply with those restrictions could effectively result in the required divestiture of ASB. Federal legislation has also been proposed in the past that could operate to eliminate the thrift charter or the grandfathered status of HEI as a unitary thrift holding company, which in turn would result in a required divestiture of ASB. In the event of a required divestiture, federal law substantially limits the types of entities that could potentially acquire ASB.Bank Regulatory Risk - Heightened regulatory requirements if ASB’s total assets exceed $10 billion.  As of December 31, 2023, ASB had total assets of approximately $9.7 billion and it is possible that total assets could exceed $10 billion in the near future. The Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations impose enhanced supervisory requirements on financial institutions with more than $10 billion in total assets. For financial institutions with more than $10 billion in total assets, such requirements include, among other things:•Applicability of Volcker Rule requirements and restrictions;•Increased capital leverage, liquidity and risk management standards;•Examinations by the CFPB for compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations; and•Limits on interchange fees on debit cards (Durbin Amendment).The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA), which was enacted in 2018, amended the Dodd-Frank Act to raise the $10 billion stress testing threshold to $250 billion, among other things. The federal financial regulators issued final rules in 2019 to increase the threshold for these stress testing requirements from $10 billion to $250 billion, consistent with the EGRRCPA.ASB is already subject to limits for its interchange fees on debit cards as the Bank’s parent company, HEI, has total assets exceeding $10 billion and the Durbin Amendment did not exclude unitary thrift holding companies from the threshold for holding company assets subject to interchange fee limits.Federal financial regulators may require ASB to take actions to prepare for compliance with the foregoing requirements before it exceeds $10 billion in total assets. ASB’s regulators may consider its preparation for compliance with these regulatory requirements when examining the Bank’s operations or considering any request for regulatory approval. ASB may, therefore, incur compliance costs before it reaches $10 billion in total assets and may be required to maintain the additional compliance procedures even if the Bank does not grow at the anticipated rate or at all.Failure to comply with these new requirements may negatively impact the results of ASB’s operations and financial condition. To ensure compliance, the Bank may be required to invest significant resources, which may necessitate hiring additional personnel and implementing additional internal controls. These additional compliance costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Legislative Risk—Legislative and regulatory initiatives could have an adverse effect on ASB’s business.  From time to time, new legislative and other regulatory initiatives are enacted, which could have an adverse effect on ASB’s business. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July 2010, has had a substantial impact on the financial services industry. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on ASB’s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Product Concentration Risk—A large percentage of ASB’s loans and securities are collateralized by real estate, and adverse changes in the real estate market and/or general economic or other conditions may result in loan losses and adversely 31affect the Company’s profitability.  As of December 31, 2023 approximately 84% of ASB’s loan portfolio was comprised of loans primarily collateralized by real estate, most of which was concentrated in the State of Hawaii. ASB’s financial results may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions, either nationally or in the state. ASB had been pursuing a strategy that included expanding its commercial, commercial real estate and consumer lines of business. Commercial and commercial real estate loans have a higher risk profile than residential loans, in part due to larger average balances than residential loans. Though both commercial and commercial real estate loans have shorter terms and earn higher spreads than residential mortgage loans, these loan types generally entail higher underwriting and other service costs and present greater credit risks than traditional residential mortgages. Commercial loans are secured by the assets of the business and, upon default, any collateral repossessed may not be sufficient to repay the outstanding loan balance. In addition, loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and, thus, are more likely to be affected by current economic conditions and adverse business developments. Commercial real estate properties tend to be unique and are more difficult to value than residential real estate properties. Commercial real estate loans may not be fully amortizing, meaning that they have a significant principal balance or “balloon” payment due at maturity. In addition, commercial real estate properties, particularly industrial and warehouse properties, are generally subject to relatively greater environmental risks than noncommercial properties and to the corresponding burdens and costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Also, there may be costs and delays involved in enforcing rights of a property owner against tenants in default under terms of leases with respect to commercial properties. For example, a tenant may seek protection under bankruptcy laws, which could result in termination of the tenant’s lease.ASB also has a national syndicated lending portfolio where ASB is a participant in credit facilities agented by established and reputable national lenders. Management selectively chooses each deal based on conservative credit criteria to ensure a high-quality, well diversified portfolio. In the event the borrower encounters financial difficulties and ASB is unable to sell its participation interest in the loan in the secondary market, ASB is typically reliant on the originating lender for managing any loan workout or foreclosure proceedings that may become necessary. Accordingly, ASB has less control over such proceedings than loans it originates and may be required to accommodate the interests of other participating lenders in resolving delinquencies or defaults on participated loans, which could result in outcomes that are not fully consistent with ASB’s preferred strategies. In addition, a significant proportion of ASB’s syndicated loans are originated in states other than Hawaii and are subject to the local regional and regulatory risks specific to those states.Similar to the national syndicated lending portfolio, ASB does not service commercial loans in which it has participation interests rather than being the lead or agent lender and is subject to the policies and practices of the agent lender, who is the loan servicer, in resolving delinquencies or defaults on participated loans.The consumer loan portfolio primarily consists of solar and sustainable home improvement loans as well as unsecured loans with risk-based pricing. Repayment is based on the borrower’s financial stability as these loans have no collateral and there is less assurance that ASB will be able to collect all payments due under these loans or have sufficient collateral to cover all outstanding loan balances.General Risk Factors
.Sustainability Risk—Increased scrutiny and changing stakeholder expectations with respect to our environmental, social and governance (sustainability) programs may result in increased costs and expenses and may expose the Company to new or incremental risks.  Companies across all industries, including HEI, face increasing stakeholder scrutiny related to sustainability practices. These stakeholders include investors, customers, consumers, employees, lenders and other stakeholders, and in recent years, certain stakeholders have placed increasing importance on the impact and social cost of their investments. This increased focus and activism related to sustainability may hinder the cost of, or access to, capital or financing as these investors or lenders may elect to increase their required returns on capital offered to the company, reallocate capital or not commit capital as a result of their assessment of a company’s sustainability risk profile. Additionally, if the Company fails to adapt, or is perceived to have failed in addressing investor, lender, and other stakeholder sustainability expectations or standards, which continue to evolve, or if the Company fails to fully and accurately report its progress on managing risk under its sustainability initiatives, the Company may suffer reputational damage and its business or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.Human Capital Risk—HEI’s businesses may be unable to attract, hire, engage and retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce, including senior management, which could affect the Company’s execution of its growth strategy and profitability and adversely affect its future performance.  The skill and experience of the Company’s employees, particularly with respect to the senior management team, are vital to the Company’s success. The management teams of HEI’s businesses have significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent, to develop and implement adequate succession plans for the senior management team, or to maintain a successful work culture that fosters collaboration, innovation, and good communication could disrupt the Company’s operations and adversely affect its businesses and its future success. In addition, a variety of economic and social factors are exacerbating the current labor supply shortage for qualified individuals, which may make it difficult to staff critical positions and retain key 32employees, and could result in significantly higher costs to maintain appropriate staffing levels with the right talent. The inability to fill these positions or a delay in staffing these positions could have a significant impact on the Company’s initiatives and strategies, which in turn would adversely affect the Company’s businesses and their future prospects.Inflation Risk—The Company’s costs and expenses could increase as a result of inflationary pressures and such increases may not be fully offset by an increase in revenues.  A variety of economic and social factors have recently driven inflation to levels above the Federal Reserve Board’s long-term target of 2%. Long-term inflationary pressures could result in higher labor, fuel oil, commodities, materials and supplies, outside services and capital costs, among others, that may not fully be offset by an increase in revenues, which would adversely affect the Company’s profitability and results of operations. For example, while the Utilities’ annual revenue adjustment mechanism provides for an annual inflationary adjustment, recent months’ annualized rates of inflation have surpassed the rate of the last inflationary adjustment for the Utilities’ target revenues. To the extent the Utilities’ increase in actual expenses exceeds the amount provided by the last inflationary adjustment and the Utilities are unable to offset such excess with other efficiencies or cost savings, the Utilities’ profitability could be adversely impacted. Similarly, to the extent that higher labor and other costs at ASB, due to inflation or other factors, is not fully offset by an increase in non-interest income or net interest income, which is dependent on interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, earning assets growth and low-cost deposit liabilities, the Bank’s profitability and results of operations would be adversely impacted.Pension Liability Risk—HEI and Hawaiian Electric and their subsidiaries may incur higher retirement benefits expenses and have and will likely continue to be subject to substantial liabilities for retirement benefits.  Retirement benefits expenses and cash funding requirements could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the performance of the U.S. equity markets, trends in interest rates and health care costs, plan amendments, mortality improvements, new laws relating to pension funding and changes in accounting principles. For the Utilities, however, retirement benefits expenses, as adjusted by the pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions (OPEB) tracking mechanisms, have been an allowable expense for rate-making purposes.Tax Legislation Risk—Adverse tax rulings or developments or changes in tax legislation could result in significant increases in tax payments and/or expense.  Governmental taxing authorities could challenge a tax return position taken by HEI or its subsidiaries and if the taxing authorities prevail, HEI’s consolidated tax payments and/or expense, including applicable penalties and interest, could increase significantly. Additionally, changes in tax legislation or IRS interpretations could increase the Company’s tax burden and adversely affect the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Litigation Risk—The Company could be subject to the risk of uninsured losses in excess of its accruals for litigation matters, such as litigation related to the Maui windstorm and wildfires. HEI and its subsidiaries are involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of their businesses, most of which is covered by insurance (subject to policy limits and deductibles). HEI and its subsidiaries are also involved, and may continue to become involved, in litigation that is not routine and/or involves claims that may not be fully covered by insurance, as may be the case with litigation related to the Maui windstorm and wildfires. Because of the uncertainties associated with the litigation related to the Maui windstorm and wildfires and other routine litigation, there is a risk that this litigation against HEI or its subsidiaries, even if vigorously defended, could result in costs of defense and judgment or settlement amounts not covered by insurance and in excess of reserves established in HEI’s consolidated financial statements.Changes in Accounting Estimates Risk—Changes in accounting principles and estimates could affect the reported amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities or revenues and expenses.  HEI’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Changes in accounting principles (including the possible adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards or new U.S. accounting standards), or changes in the Company’s application of existing accounting principles, could materially affect the financial statement presentation of HEI’s or the Utilities’ consolidated results of operations and/or financial condition. Further, in preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the amounts reported for electric utility revenues; allowance for credit losses; income taxes; investment securities, property, plant and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; derivatives; pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; and contingencies and litigation.Changes in accounting principles can also impact HEI’s consolidated financial statements. For example, if management determines that a PPA requires the consolidation of the IPP in the financial statements, the consolidation could have a material effect on Hawaiian Electric’s and HEI’s consolidated financial statements, including the recognition of a significant amount of assets and liabilities and, if such a consolidated IPP were operating at a loss and had insufficient equity, the potential recognition of such losses.  33"
16,HE,HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC INDS,2023-02-27,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORSThe businesses of HEI and its subsidiaries involve numerous risks which, if realized, could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements. For additional information for certain risk factors enumerated below and other risks of the Company and its operations, see “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” above and HEI’s MD&A, HEI’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Hawaiian Electric’s MD&A and Hawaiian Electric’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”Holding company and company-wide risks.COVID-19—Our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations have been affected and could continue to be adversely impacted by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic conditions.  While COVID-19 restrictions in Hawaii have been lifted as vaccination rates increased and new daily case counts moderated, which lead to improved economic conditions in the state, new COVID-19 variants could result in a reinstatement of restrictions that could threaten the ongoing economic recovery and have a material adverse effect on the Company. For example, an economic downturn or recession could result in an increase in late payments, non-payments, higher costs, and reduced access to credit, which could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. During the pandemic, the Utilities placed a moratorium on customer disconnections, which led to increasing past due past due accounts receivables that had an impact on liquidity. Although the Utilities have adequate access to liquidity sources, there can be no assurance that the Utilities will be able to secure additional liquidity sources at a reasonable cost, or at all, in the future. In addition to lower and lagged collections caused by the pandemic, the Utilities incurred higher costs and expenses. While the Utilities have been granted deferral treatment of certain COVID-19 related costs, such as higher bad debt expense, non-collection of late payment fees, higher financing costs, sequestration costs for mission-critical employees and other costs and expenses, there can be no assurance that the PUC will grant recovery of such costs, and the denial of such cost recovery could be material. Additionally, in light of the significant impact that economic conditions have had on residents and businesses in the state, a stipulated settlement between Hawaiian Electric and the Division of Consumer Advocacy of the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, reflecting no base rate increase, was submitted in the Hawaiian Electric 2020 test year rate case, and approved by the PUC in October 2020. While the Utilities were successful in offsetting the no base rate increase with 20corresponding cost decreases, such reduction of cost in future periods is not assured and, therefore, the inability to achieve targeted cost savings could adversely affect the Utilities’ results of operations in future periods. ASB’s balance sheet has historically been asset sensitive and its net interest income is highly sensitive to interest rates. Accordingly, an extended economic slowdown or recession could have a significant impact on its net interest income if interest rates decline. In addition, while economic conditions improved in 2022, the emergence of new COVID-19 variants could lead to an extended economic slowdown or recession that may affect the ability of borrowers to make payments on their loans, which would have an adverse impact on ASB’s provision for credit losses and its results of operations.While the Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to continue to operate under current economic conditions, there can be no assurance that sufficient liquidity will be available if there is a significant slowdown in economic activity for an extended period of time or if economic conditions worsen from current levels, leading to a recession. Holding Company Risk—HEI is a holding company that derives its income from its operating subsidiaries and depends on the ability of those subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI and on its own ability to raise capital.  HEI is a legal entity separate and distinct from its various subsidiaries. As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, HEI’s cash flows and consequent ability to service its obligations and pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon its receipt of dividends or other distributions from its operating subsidiaries and its ability to issue common stock or other equity securities and to incur additional debt. The ability of HEI’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI, in turn, is subject to the risks associated with their operations and to contractual and regulatory restrictions, including:•the provisions of an HEI agreement with the PUC, which could limit the ability of HEI’s principal electric public utility subsidiary, Hawaiian Electric, to pay dividends to HEI in the event that the consolidated common stock equity of the Utilities falls below 35% of total capitalization of the electric utilities;•the provisions of an HEI agreement entered into with federal bank regulators in connection with its acquisition of its bank subsidiary, ASB, which requires HEI to contribute additional capital to ASB (up to a maximum amount of additional capital of $28.3 million as of December 31, 2022 under the Regulatory Capital Maintenance/Dividend Agreement dated May 26, 1988, between HEI, HEIDI (HEI Diversified Inc.) and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation) upon request of the regulators in order to maintain ASB’s regulatory capital at the level required by regulation;•obligations under federal law and Federal Reserve Board policy, which require that a savings and loan holding company serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for any FDIC-insured depository institution that it controls, and accordingly, if ASB were to be in financial distress or to otherwise be viewed by the regulators as in unsatisfactory condition, HEI could be required to provide additional capital or liquidity support or take other action, in support of ASB;•the minimum capital and capital distribution regulations of the OCC that are applicable to ASB and capital regulations that become applicable to HEI and ASB Hawaii;•the receipt of a letter from the FRB communicating the OCC’s and the FRB’s non-objection to the payment of any dividend ASB proposes to declare and pay to ASB Hawaii and HEI; and•the provisions of preferred stock resolutions and debt instruments of HEI and its subsidiaries.Credit and Capital Market Risk—The Company, and its credit rating, is subject to risks associated with the Hawaii economy (in the aggregate and on an individual island basis), volatile U.S. capital markets and changes in the interest rate and credit market environment that have or could result in higher retirement benefit plan funding requirements, declines in ASB’s interest rate margins and investment values, higher delinquencies and charge-offs in ASB’s loan portfolio and restrictions on the ability of HEI or its subsidiaries to borrow money or issue securities.  The two largest components of Hawaii’s economy are tourism and the federal government (including the military). Because the core businesses of HEI’s subsidiaries are providing local public electric utility services (through Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries) and banking services (through ASB) in Hawaii, the Company’s operating results are significantly influenced by: Hawaii’s economy, which in turn is influenced by economic conditions in the mainland U.S. (particularly California) and Asia (particularly Japan) as a result of the impact of those conditions on tourism; by the impact of interest rates on the construction and real estate industries and by the impact of federal government spending in Hawaii, which can be affected by world conditions; and, from time to time, the expiration of federal government appropriations bills. In addition, the Hawaii economy could be directly or indirectly affected by implications and potential impacts of U.S. and foreign capital and credit market conditions and federal, state and international responses to those conditions and the potential impacts of global and local developments (including economic conditions and uncertainties; unrest, terrorist acts, wars (such as the Russia-Ukraine war), conflicts, political protests, deadly virus epidemic, pandemics, or other crisis; the effects of changes that have or may occur in U.S. policy, such as with respect to immigration and trade).    HEI’s and Hawaiian Electric’s credit ratings only reflect the view, at the time the ratings are issued, of the applicable rating agency. There is no assurance that any such credit rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such rating will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agency if, in such rating agency’s judgment, 21circumstances, such as current, past or future effects or events so warrant. Any such lowering, suspension or withdrawal of any rating may have an adverse effect on the availability of capital to the Company or the market price or marketability of HEI’s and/or Hawaiian Electric’s securities, which could increase the cost of capital of HEI and Hawaiian Electric, and such increased costs, including interest charges, under HEI’s and/or Hawaiian Electric’s debt securities and credit facilities, would result in reductions in HEI’s consolidated net income in future periods. Further, if HEI’s or Hawaiian Electric’s commercial paper ratings were to be downgraded, HEI and Hawaiian Electric might not be able to sell commercial paper and might be required to draw on more expensive bank lines of credit or to defer capital or other expenditures. Neither HEI nor Hawaiian Electric management can predict future rating agency actions or their effects on the future cost of capital of HEI or Hawaiian Electric. Such ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold any securities; such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies; and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.Changes in the U.S. capital markets can also have significant effects on the Company. For example, pension funding requirements are affected by the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for pension plans, and by the discount rate used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost and value obligations. The Utilities’ pension tracking mechanisms help moderate pension expense; however, a significant reduction in the discount rate or in the value of the Company’s defined benefit pension plan assets could result in a substantial increase in the gap between the projected benefit obligations under the plans and the value of plan assets, resulting in increases in funding requirements.Because the earnings of ASB depend primarily on net interest income, interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASB’s operations. HEI and the Utilities are also exposed to interest rate risk primarily due to their periodic borrowing requirements, the discount rate used to determine pension funding requirements and the possible effect of interest rates on the electric utilities’ rates of return. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors, including general economic conditions and the policies of government and regulatory authorities. HEI cannot predict future changes in interest rates, nor be certain that interest rate risk management strategies it or its subsidiaries have implemented will be successful in managing interest rate risk.Interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting the fair value of ASB’s investment securities. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair values of those instruments, respectively. Disruptions in the credit markets, a liquidity crisis in the banking industry or increased levels of residential mortgage delinquencies and defaults may result in decreases in the fair value of ASB’s investment securities and an impairment, requiring ASB to write down its investment securities. As of December 31, 2022, ASB’s investment in U.S. Treasury and federal agency obligations, and mortgage-backed securities have an implicit guarantee from the U.S. government. Decreases in the fair value of ASB’s investment securities may also result in lower equity capital balances as unrealized losses in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio are recorded as a decrease in equity capital through accumulated other comprehensive losses. The lower equity capital balance could result in a lower tangible equity capital ratio and restrict ASB’s permissible activities if the tangible equity capital ratio falls below 2%. A negative tangible equity capital ratio would impact ASB’s availability to borrow funds from the FHLB of Des Moines.Geographic Concentration Risk—The Company is subject to the risks associated with the geographic concentration of its businesses and current lack of interconnections that could result in service interruptions at the Utilities or higher default rates on loans held by ASB.  The business of the Utilities is concentrated on the individual islands they serve in the State of Hawaii. Their operations are more vulnerable to service interruptions than that of many U.S. mainland utilities because none of the systems of the Utilities are interconnected with the systems on the other islands they serve. Because of this lack of interconnections, it is necessary to maintain higher generation reserve margins than are typical for U.S. mainland utilities to help ensure reliable service. Service interruptions, including, in particular, extended interruptions that could result from a natural disaster or terrorist activity, could adversely impact the revenues and costs of some or all of the Utilities.Substantially all of ASB’s consumer loan customers are Hawaii residents. A significant portion of the commercial loan customers are also located in Hawaii. While a majority of customers are on Oahu, ASB also has customers on the neighbor islands (whose economies have traditionally been weaker than Oahu’s economy during economic downturns). Substantially all of the real estate underlying ASB’s residential and commercial real estate loans are located in Hawaii. These assets may be subject to a greater risk of default due to geographic concentration than other comparable assets held by financial institutions with more diverse geographic exposure in the event of adverse economic, political or business developments or natural disasters affecting Hawaii and affect the ability of ASB’s customers to make payments of principal and interest on their loans.Competitive and Technological Risk—Increasing competition and technological advances could cause HEI’s businesses to lose customers or render their operations obsolete.  The banking industry in Hawaii, and certain aspects of the electric utility industry, are competitive. The success of HEI’s subsidiaries in meeting competition and responding to technological advances will continue to have a direct impact on HEI’s consolidated financial performance. For example:22•ASB, one of the largest financial institutions in the state, is in direct competition for deposits and loans not only with two larger institutions that have substantial capital, technology and marketing resources, but also with smaller Hawaii institutions and other U.S. institutions, including credit unions, mutual funds, mortgage brokers, finance companies, non-traditional providers of financial services and investment banking firms. Larger financial institutions may have greater access to capital at lower costs, which could impair ASB’s ability to compete effectively. New or significant advances in technology (e.g., significant advances in internet or mobile banking) or customer adoption of alternative banking channels could render the operations of ASB less competitive or obsolete. •The Utilities face competition from IPPs; customer self-generation, with or without cogeneration; customer energy storage; and the potential formation of community-based, cooperative ownership or municipality structures for electrical service on all islands it serves. With the exception of certain identified projects, the Utilities are required to use competitive bidding to acquire a future generation resource unless the PUC finds competitive bidding to be unsuitable. The PUC sets policies for distributed generation interconnection agreements and standby rates. The results of competitive bidding, competition from IPPs, customer self-generation, and potential cooperative ownership or municipality structures for electric utility service, and the rate at which technological developments facilitating nonutility generation of electricity, combined heat and power technology, off-grid microgrids, and customer energy storage may render the operations of the Utilities less competitive or outdated and adversely affect the Utilities and the results of their operations. Cybersecurity Risk—The Company may be subject to information technology and operational system failures, network disruptions, cyber attacks and breaches in data security that could adversely affect its businesses and reputation.  The Company and its subsidiaries rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed or hosted by third party service providers, to manage its business data, communications, and other business processes. Such information technology systems may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or other security incidents, which could result in unauthorized access to confidential data, ransomware demands or disruptions to operations. In addition, there is increasing cybersecurity risk associated with the broad adoption of a remote working environment as a result of the pandemic. If the Company is unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve an incident, it may have a material impact on the Company’s operations or business reputation.Utilities.  The Utilities rely on evolving and increasingly complex operational and information systems, networks and other technologies, which are interconnected with the systems and network infrastructure owned by third parties to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, invoicing and collection of payments, customer relationship management, human resource management, the acquisition, generation and delivery of electrical service to customers, and to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting and legal and tax requirements. The Utilities use their systems and infrastructure to create, collect, store, and process sensitive information, including personal information regarding customers, employees and their dependents, retirees, and other individuals. Despite the Utilities security measures, all of their systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access caused by natural disasters, cybersecurity incidents, security breaches, user error, unintentional defects created by system changes, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures or similar events. Any such failure could have a material adverse impact on the Utilities’ ability to process transactions and provide service, as well the Utilities’ financial condition and results of operations. Further, a data breach involving theft, improper disclosure, or other unauthorized access to or acquisition of confidential information could subject the Utilities to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, claims by third parties, and enforcement actions by government agencies. A data breach could also reduce the value of proprietary information, and harm the reputation of the Utilities.Private and public entities, such as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and the U.S. federal government, including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Energy, and the White House, have noted that cyber-attacks targeting utility systems are increasing in sophistication, magnitude, and frequency.  The Utilities’ systems have been, and will likely continue to be, a target of attacks. Further, the Utilities’ operational networks may be subject to new cybersecurity risks due to modernizing and interconnecting existing infrastructure with new technologies and control systems, including those owned by third parties, such as independent power producers, distributed energy resource aggregators and customers. Although the Utilities have not experienced a material cybersecurity breach to date, such incidents may occur and may have a material adverse effect on the Utilities and the Company in the future. In order to address cybersecurity risks to their information systems, the Utilities maintain security measures designed to protect their information technology systems, network infrastructure and other assets. The Utilities actively monitor developments in the area of cybersecurity and are involved in various related government and industry groups, and brief the Company’s Board quarterly on relevant cybersecurity issues. Although the Utilities continue to make investments in their cybersecurity program, including personnel, technologies, cyber insurance and training of Utilities personnel, there can be no assurance that these systems or their expected functionality will be implemented, maintained, or expanded effectively; nor can security measures completely eliminate the possibility of a cybersecurity breach. The Utility maintains cyber liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents. However, there is no guarantee that adequate insurance will continue to be available at rates the Utility believes are reasonable or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered by insurance or recoverable 23in rates. If the Utilities’ cybersecurity measures were to be breached, the Utilities could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to their reputations.Due to the size, scope and complexity of the Utilities’ business, the development and maintenance of information technology systems to process and track information is critical and challenging. The Utilities often rely on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems and these third-party vendors could cease to exist, fail to establish adequate processes to protect the Utilities systems and information, experience supply chain compromises or other internal or external security incidents. In addition, the Utilities are pursuing complex business transformation initiatives, which include the implementation of new systems and the upgrade or replacement of existing systems. Significant system changes increase the risk of system interruptions. Although the Utilities maintain change control processes to mitigate this risk, system interruptions may occur. Further, delay or failure to complete the integration of information systems and processes may result in delays in regulatory cost recovery, or the failure to realize the benefits anticipated to be derived from these initiatives.The Utilities have disaster recovery and incident response plans in place to protect their businesses from information technology service interruptions. The disaster recovery plans, however, may not be successful in preventing the loss of customer data, service interruptions and disruptions to operations or damage to important facilities. If any of these systems fail to operate properly or become disabled and the Utilities’ disaster recovery plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, the Utilities could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to their reputations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities’ and the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.ASB.  ASB is highly dependent on its ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions and relies heavily on communication and information systems, including those of third-party vendors and other service providers. Communication and information system failures can result from a variety of risks including, but not limited to, events that are wholly or partially out of ASB’s control, such as communication line integrity, weather, terrorist acts, natural disasters, accidental disasters, unauthorized breaches of security systems, energy delivery systems, cyberattacks and other events.ASB is under continuous threat of loss due to cyberattacks, especially as ASB continues to expand customer capabilities to utilize the Internet and other digital channels to transact business. Two of the most significant cyberattack risks that ASB faces are e-fraud and loss of sensitive customer data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals extract funds directly from ASB or its customers’ accounts using fraudulent schemes that may include Internet-based funds transfers. ASB has been subject to e-fraud incidents historically. Loss of sensitive customer data are attempts to steal sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, through unauthorized access to computer systems, including computer hacking. Such attacks are less frequent, but could present significant reputational, legal and regulatory costs if successful. Intrusion detection and prevention systems, anti-virus software, firewalls and other general information technology controls have been put in place to detect and prevent cyberattacks or information system breaches. A disaster recovery plan has been developed in the event of a natural disaster, security breach, military or terrorist action, power or communication failure or similar event. The disaster recovery plan, however, may not be successful in preventing the loss of customer data, service interruptions, disruptions to operations or damage to important facilities. Although ASB devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of ASB’s computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to ASB and its customers, there can be no assurance that such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately corrected by ASB or its vendors.If any of these systems fail to operate properly or become disabled even for a brief period of time, ASB could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to its reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on ASB’s and the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. Uninsured Losses—HEI’s businesses could suffer losses that are uninsured due to a lack of affordable insurance coverage, unavailability of insurance coverage or limitations on the insurance coverage the Company does have.  In the ordinary course of business, HEI and its subsidiaries purchase insurance coverages (e.g., property and liability coverages) to protect against loss of, or damage to, their properties and against claims made by third parties and employees for property damage or personal injuries. However, the protection provided by such insurance is limited in significant respects and, in some instances, there is no coverage. Some of the insurance coverages have substantial deductibles or has limits on the maximum amounts that may be recovered. In common with other companies in its line of business, the Utilities’ overhead and underground transmission and distribution systems (with the exception of substation buildings and contents), which have a replacement value roughly estimated at $9 billion, are largely not insured against loss or damage because the amount of transmission and distribution system insurance capacity is limited and the premiums are cost prohibitive. Similarly, the Utilities have no business interruption insurance as the premiums for such insurance would be cost prohibitive, particularly since the Utilities are not interconnected to other systems. If a hurricane or other uninsured catastrophic natural disaster were to occur, and if the PUC did not allow the affected Utilities to recover from ratepayers restoration costs and revenues lost from business interruption, the lost revenues and 24repair expenses could result in a significant decrease in HEI’s consolidated net income or in significant net losses for the affected periods.ASB generally does not obtain credit enhancements, such as mortgagor bankruptcy insurance, but does require standard hazard and hurricane insurance and may require flood insurance for certain properties. ASB is subject to the risks of borrower defaults and bankruptcies, special hazard losses not covered by the required insurance and the insurance company’s inability to pay claims on existing policies.Environmental Regulation—Increased federal and state environmental regulation will require an increasing commitment of resources and funds and could result in construction delays or penalties and fines for non-compliance.  HEI and its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, hazardous substances, waste management, natural resources and health and safety, which regulate, among other matters, the operation of existing facilities, the construction and operation of new facilities and the proper cleanup and disposal of hazardous and toxic wastes and substances. These laws and regulations could result in increased capital, operating, and other costs. HEI or its subsidiaries are currently involved in investigatory or remedial actions at current, former or third-party sites and there is no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs relating to these sites. In addition, compliance with these legal requirements requires the Utilities to commit significant resources and funds toward, among other things, environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment and payment of emission fees. These laws and regulations, among other things, require that certain environmental permits be obtained in order to construct or operate certain facilities, and obtaining such permits can entail significant expense and cause substantial construction delays. Also, these laws and regulations may be amended from time to time, including amendments that increase the burden and cost of compliance. For example, emission and/or discharge limits may be tightened, more extensive permitting requirements may be imposed and additional substances may become regulated. In addition, significant regulatory uncertainty exists regarding the impact of federal or state greenhouse gas emission limits and reductions.If HEI or its subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond their control, that failure may result in civil or criminal penalties and fines or the cessation of operations that could have a material adverse on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Electric utility risks.    The following risks are generally specific to Hawaiian Electric, but could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Regulatory Risk—Actions of the PUC are outside the control of the Utilities and could result in inadequate or untimely rate increases, rate reductions or refunds or unanticipated delays, expenses or writedowns in connection with the construction of new projects.  The rates the Utilities are allowed to charge for their services and the timeliness of permitted rate increases are among the most important items influencing the Utilities’ results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The PUC has broad discretion over the rates that the Utilities charge their customers. On December 23, 2020, as part of the D&O establishing the PBR Framework, the PUC established a five-year Multi-year Rate Period (MRP) during which there will be no general rate cases. In the fourth year of the MRP, the PUC will comprehensively review the PBR Framework to determine if any modifications or revisions are appropriate. Any adverse decision by the PUC concerning the level or method of determining electric utility rates at the end of the MRP, including the items and amounts that may be included in rate base, the returns on equity or rate base found to be reasonable, the potential consequences of exceeding or not meeting such returns, the denial of exceptional project recovery applications during the MRP, adverse impact of adjustments made to the PBR Framework, decisions on recovery of exogenous items under the PBR Framework, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding could have a material adverse effect on Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.To improve the timing and certainty of the recovery of their costs, the Utilities have proposed and/or received approval of various cost recovery mechanisms, including an ECRC (includes a PUC-ordered 98%/2% risk-sharing split between customers and the Utilities for fossil fuel price variations from baseline prices, with a current annual aggregate exposure cap of +/- $3.7 million), a PPAC, and pension and OPEB tracking mechanisms, as well as a decoupling mechanism, an exceptional project recovery mechanism (EPRM) (formerly Major Project Interim Recovery (MPIR) adjustment mechanism), and a Renewable Energy Infrastructure Program surcharge. A change in, or the elimination of, any of these cost recovery mechanisms, could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities. See “Regulatory mechanisms” in Electric Utility’s Business.Under the PBR Framework, the Utilities’ annual revenue adjustment (ARA) includes a customer dividend consisting of a negative adjustment of 0.22% compounded annually and a flow through of the “pre-PBR” savings commitment from the management audit recommendations developed in the 2020 test year rate case. The ability of the Utilities to recover increasing costs and earn a reasonable return on capital investments not covered by the ARA or not achieving the customer dividend and 25cost savings commitment could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities. Under the PBR Framework, the existing PIMs continue, and the PUC established new PIMs and is working on additional PIMs with stakeholders. The assessment of penalties for not achieving performance goals or the failure to achieve PIMs rewards could affect the Utilities’ ability to achieve their allowed ROACEs and have a material adverse effect on the Utilities. Based on the current operations of the Utilities and regulatory framework, including the impact of the approved PBR Framework, the Utilities continue to follow regulatory accounting under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 980. Continued accounting in this manner requires that certain criteria relating to the recoverability of such costs through rates be met, including achieved financial results that support the recovery of costs. If events or circumstances should change, such that the criteria are no longer satisfied, the Utilities expect that their regulatory assets (amounting to $243 million as of December 31, 2022), net of regulatory liabilities (amounting to $1,056 million as of December 31, 2022), would be charged to the statement of income in the period of discontinuance. See “Performance-based regulation framework” in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.The Utilities could be required to refund to their customers, with interest, revenues that have been or may be received under interim rate orders in their rate case proceedings and other proceedings, if and to the extent they exceed the amounts allowed in final orders.Many public utility projects require PUC approval and various permits (e.g., environmental and land use permits) from other governmental agencies. Difficulties in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, the necessary approvals or permits, or any adverse decision or policy made or adopted, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision, by an agency with respect to such approvals and permits, can result in significantly increased project costs or even cancellation of projects. In the event a project does not proceed, or if the PUC disallows cost recovery for all or part of a project, or if project costs exceed caps imposed by the PUC in its approval of the project, project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could result in significant reductions in Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated net income. See risk factor, “COVID-19—Our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations are being and could continue to be adversely impacted by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic” in the “Holding company and company-wide” risk factor section for a discussion regarding the risks related to the recovery of deferred COVID-19 costs and expenses.Weather Conditions Risk—Electric utility operations are significantly influenced by weather conditions and natural disasters.  The Utilities’ results of operations can be affected by the weather and natural disasters. Weather conditions, particularly temperature and humidity, directly influence the demand for electricity. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, lava flows and lightning storms, some of which may become more severe or frequent as a result of global climate changes, have occurred in the past (such as the Kilauea eruption in 2018 which resulted in PGV’s shutdown, and the Mauna Loa eruption in 2022) and will likely continue to occur in the future. When these events occur, they can cause outages and property damage and require the Utilities to incur significant additional expenses that may not be recoverable.Climate Change Risk—Electric utility operations may be significantly influenced by climate change.  While the timing, extent and ultimate effects of climate change cannot be determined with any certainty, climate change is predicted to result in sea level rise, which could potentially impact coastal and other low-lying areas (where much of the Utilities’ electric infrastructure is sited), and could cause erosion of beaches, saltwater intrusion into aquifers and surface ecosystems, higher water tables and increased flooding and storm damage due to heavy rainfall. The effects of climate change on the weather (for example, floods, hurricanes, heat waves or drought conditions, the latter of which could increase wildfire risk), sea levels, and water availability and quality, all have the potential to materially adversely affect the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities. For example, severe weather and its related impacts could cause significant harm to the Utilities’ physical facilities. Third Party Performance Risk—Electric utility operations depend heavily on third-party suppliers of fuel and purchased power.  The Utilities rely on fuel suppliers and shippers, and IPPs to deliver fuel and power, respectively, in accordance with contractual agreements. Approximately 72% of the net energy generated or purchased by the Utilities in 2022 was generated from the burning of fossil fuel oil, and purchases of power by the Utilities provided about 43% of their total net energy generated and purchased for the same period. Failure or delay by fuel suppliers and shippers to provide fuel pursuant to existing contracts, or failure by a major IPP to deliver the firm capacity anticipated in its PPA, could disrupt the ability of the Utilities to deliver electricity, affect the Utilities’ maintenance schedules that could affect future reliability and require the Utilities to incur additional expenses to meet the needs of their customers that may not be recoverable. In addition, as the IPP contracts near the end of their terms, there may be less economic incentive for the IPPs to make investments in their units to ensure the availability of their units. Also, as these contractual agreements end, the Utilities may not be able to purchase fuel and power on terms equivalent to the current contractual agreements.26Capacity Risk—The capacity provided by the Utilities’ generating resources and third-party purchased power may not be sufficient to meet customers’ energy requirements.  The Utilities rely upon their generating resources and purchased power from third parties to meet their customers’ energy requirements. The Utilities update their generation capacity evaluation each year to determine the Utilities’ ability to meet reasonably expected demands for service and provide reasonable reserves for emergencies and other unplanned events. These evaluations are impacted by a variety of factors, including customer energy demand, energy conservation and efficiency initiatives, economic conditions, and weather patterns. If the capacity provided by the Utilities’ generating resources and third-party purchased power is not adequate relative to customer demand, the Utilities may have to contract to buy more power from third parties, invest in additional generating facilities over the long-term, or extend the operating life of existing utility units. Any failure to meet customer energy requirements could negatively impact the satisfaction of the Utilities’ customers, which could have an adverse impact on the Utilities’ business, reputation and results of operations. Stakeholder Activism Risk—Electric utility and third-party purchased power projects may be significantly impacted by stakeholder activism.  The potential impact of stakeholder activism could increase total utility project costs, and delay the permitting, construction and overall timing or preclude the completion of third-party or utility projects that are required to meet electricity demand, resilience and reliability objectives, and RPS and other climate related goals. If a utility project cannot be completed, the project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could result in significant reductions in Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated net income and negatively impact its financial condition and liquidity. Operational Risk—Electric utility generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated and/or increased operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs.  Operation of electric generating facilities involves certain risks which can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels. Included among these risks are facility shutdowns or power interruptions due to insufficient generation or a breakdown or failure of equipment or processes. In addition, operations could be negatively impacted by interruptions in fuel supply, inability to negotiate satisfactory collective bargaining agreements when existing agreements expire or other labor disputes, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements, disruptions in delivery of electricity, operator error and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, fires, explosions, lava flows, floods or other similar occurrences affecting the Utilities’ generating facilities or transmission and distribution systems.Legislative Risk—The Utilities may be adversely affected by new legislation or administrative actions.  Congress, the Hawaii legislature and governmental agencies periodically consider legislation and other initiatives that could have uncertain or negative effects on the Utilities and their customers. Congress, the Hawaii legislature and governmental agencies have adopted, or are considering adopting, a number of measures that will significantly affect the Utilities, as described below.Renewable Portfolio Standards law.  The 2001 Hawaii Legislature adopted a law requiring the Utilities to meet a renewable portfolio standard, which has been amended over the years. The most recent amendment to Hawaii’s RPS law occurred in 2015, which requires the electric utilities to meet an RPS of 15%, 30%, 40%, 70% and 100% by December 31, 2015, 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2045 respectively. Energy savings resulting from energy efficiency programs do not count toward the RPS after 2014. In July 2022, Governor Ige signed Act 240 (H.B.2089), that amended the RPS calculation from renewable energy as a percentage of sales to renewable energy as a percentage of total generation. The amended RPS calculation results in a lower calculated percentage than the amount calculated under the previous methodology. The change in the definition is to be applied prospectively to future milestone measurements and will require that the Utilities acquire more renewable energy than under the previous RPS calculation to comply with the RPS milestones. The Utilities are committed to achieving these goals and met the 2015 and 2020 RPS; however, due to the exclusion of energy savings in calculating RPS after 2014 and risks such as potential delays in IPPs being able to deliver contracted renewable energy, it is possible the Utilities may not attain the required renewable percentages in the future, and management cannot predict the future consequences of failure to do so (including potential penalties to be assessed by the PUC). On December 19, 2008, the PUC approved a penalty of $20 for every MWh that an electric utility is deficient under Hawaii’s RPS law. The PUC noted, however, that this penalty may be reduced, in the PUC’s discretion, due to events or circumstances that are outside an electric utility’s reasonable control, to the extent the event or circumstance could not be reasonably foreseen and ameliorated, as described in the RPS law and in an RPS framework adopted by the PUC. In addition, the PUC ordered that the Utilities will be prohibited from recovering any RPS penalty costs through rates.Renewable energy.  In 2007, a measure was passed by the Hawaii legislature stating that the PUC may consider the need for increased renewable energy in rendering decisions on utility matters. Due to this measure, it is possible that, if energy from a renewable source is more expensive than energy from fossil fuel, the PUC may still approve the purchase of energy from the renewable source, resulting in higher costs.Global climate change and greenhouse gas emissions reduction.  National and international concern about climate change and the contribution of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (including carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of 27fossil fuels) to climate change have led to federal legislative and regulatory proposals and action by the state of Hawaii to reduce GHG emissions. In July 2007, the State Legislature passed Act 234, which requires a statewide reduction of GHG emissions by January 1, 2020 to levels at or below the statewide GHG emission levels in 1990. On June 20, 2014, the Governor signed the final rules required to implement Act 234 and these rules went into effect on June 30, 2014. In general, Act 234 and the GHG rule require affected sources that have the potential to emit GHGs in excess of established thresholds to reduce their GHG emissions by 16% below 2010 emission levels by 2020. In accordance with state requirements, the Utilities submitted an Emissions Reduction Plan (ERP) to the DOH on June 30, 2015, with the most recent revision filed on June 9, 2020, to reflect the partnership established between the Utilities and several IPPs. In this plan, the partnership committed to a 16% reduction in GHG emissions in accordance with the rule, which the partnership achieved in 2017 in advance of the 2020 requirement. The DOH issued the air permits incorporating the ERP, including provisions to address the period of unavailability of the PGV facility on Hawaii Island. It is expected that with the advent of additional renewable projects and the application to the PUC with respect to the expansion of the PPA for the PGV project, the goals should be attainable. Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 269-6(b) requires that “in making determinations of the reasonableness of the costs pertaining to electric or gas utility system capital improvements and operations, the PUC shall explicitly consider, quantitatively or qualitatively, the effect of the state’s reliance on fossil fuels on price volatility, export of funds for fuel imports, fuel supply reliability risk, and greenhouse gas emissions.” Based on HRS § 269-6(b) and recent case law discussing the scope of this section, the Utilities are performing GHG analyses to quantitatively or qualitatively describe the GHG emissions of proposed projects that are submitted to the PUC for approval.In June 2018, House Bill 2182 was signed into law as Act 15 and took effect on July 1, 2018. Among its provisions, Act 15 aligned the state’s clean energy and carbon sequestration efforts with climate initiative goals and established a statewide carbon neutral goal by 2045. Under this Act, efforts would be made to “sequester more atmospheric carbon and greenhouse gases than emitted within the state as quickly as practicable, but no later than 2045.” The Hawaii Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission, administratively placed under the State Department of Land and Natural Resources, was charged with endeavoring to achieve the target, and giving consideration to the impact of its plans, decisions and strategies on the state’s ability to attain the goal. The general functions, duties and powers of the Hawaii Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission are set forth in HRS § 225P-3. To achieve its mandates, the Hawaii Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission may recommend plans, decisions and strategies that could have an impact on various entities including the Utilities. In July 2022, House Bill 1800 was signed into law as Act 238 and took effect on July 1, 2022. The Act established a goal for the statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit to be at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030.The Utilities have taken, and continue to identify opportunities to take, direct action to reduce GHG emissions from their operations, including, but not limited to, supporting demand-side management programs that foster energy efficiency, using renewable resources for energy production and purchasing power from IPPs generated by renewable resources, and burning renewable biodiesel at selected Hawaiian Electric and Maui Electric generating units. In November 2021, the Utilities committed to a 70% reduction in power generation GHG emissions by 2030 compared to a 2005 baseline and achievement of net zero carbon emissions from power generation by 2045. While the reduction is not mandated by law, the Utilities could suffer reputational harm if it fails to achieve its commitments, which may negatively impact its business.The foregoing legislation or legislation that now is, or may in the future be, proposed, such as potential carbon “cap and trade” legislation that, if applicable, may fundamentally alter costs to produce electricity and accelerate the move to renewable generation, present risks and uncertainties for the Utilities.Renewable Transition Risk—The Utilities may be subject to increased operational challenges and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely impacted in meeting the commitments and objectives of clean energy initiatives, Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) and other climate related goals.  The far-reaching nature of the Utilities’ renewable energy commitments and the RPS and other climate related goals present risks to the Company. Among such risks are: (1) the potential delay by the Public Utilities Commission of the State of Hawaii (PUC) in considering (and potential disapproval of actual or proposed) renewable energy proposals and related costs; (2) the dependence on outside parties, such as the state, developers and third-party suppliers of renewable purchased energy, which if the Utilities are unsuccessful in negotiating purchased power agreements with such IPPs or if a major IPP delays or fails to deliver the anticipated capacity and/or energy in its purchased power agreement, could impact the Utilities’ achievement of their commitments to RPS and other climate related goals, eligibility for performance incentive mechanisms associated with the speed of increasing renewable generation, the ability to retire fossil fuel units, and/or the Utilities’ ability to deliver reliable service; (3) delays in acquiring or unavailability of non-fossil fuel supplies for renewable generation; (4) the impact of intermittent power to the electrical grid and reliability of service if appropriate supporting infrastructure is not installed or does not operate effectively; (5) the inability to recover the undepreciated cost of fossil fuel generating units if they are required to be retired before the end of their expected useful life; (6) uncertainties surrounding current and future renewable technologies, 28such as solar power, wind power, biofuels, battery storage, hydro, hydrogen, as well as related environmental assessments required to meet RPS and other climate related goals; (7) the impacts of implementation of the renewable energy proposals on future costs of electricity and potential penalties imposed by the PUC for delays in the commercial operations of renewable energy projects; (8) the likelihood that the Utilities may need to make substantial investments in related infrastructure, which could result in increased borrowings and, therefore, materially impact the financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities; (9) the imputed debt related to the pending renewable power purchase agreements under the stage 1,  stage 2, stage 3 and other RFPs could result in a credit rating downgrade for the Utilities and the Company; and (10) the commitment to support a variety of initiatives, which, if approved by the PUC, may have a material impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the Utilities depending on their design and implementation. These initiatives include, but are not limited to, programs to enable more customer-sited generation. The implementation of these or other programs may adversely impact the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities.Bank risks.The following risks are generally specific to ASB, but could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Interest Rate Risk—Fluctuations in interest rates could result in lower net interest income, impair ASB’s ability to originate new loans or impair the ability of ASB’s adjustable-rate borrowers to make increased payments or cause such borrowers to repay their adjustable-rate loans or impact ASB’s ability to attract deposits.  Interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASB’s operations. ASB’s net interest income consists primarily of interest income received on fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, mortgage-backed securities and investments, less interest expense consisting primarily of interest paid on deposits and other borrowings. Interest rate risk arises when earning assets mature or when their interest rates change in a time frame different from that of the costing liabilities. Changes in market interest rates, including changes in the relationship between short-term and long-term market interest rates (e.g., a flat or an inverted yield curve) or between different interest rate indices, and the duration and severity of the changes in market interest rates can impact ASB’s net interest margin. See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.” Although ASB pursues an asset-liability management strategy designed to mitigate its risk from changes in market interest rates, unfavorable movements in interest rates could result in lower net interest income. Residential 1-4 family fixed-rate mortgage loans comprised about 38% of ASB’s loan portfolio as of December 31, 2022 and do not re-price with movements in interest rates. ASB continues to face a challenging interest rate environment. Increases in market interest rates could have an adverse impact on ASB’s cost of funds. Higher market interest rates could lead to higher interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Significant increases in market interest rates, or the perception that an increase may occur, could adversely affect ASB’s ability to originate new loans and grow. An increase in market interest rates, especially a sudden increase, similar to the rapid federal funds rate increases experienced in 2022, could also adversely affect the ability of ASB’s adjustable-rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations. If this occurred, it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets and charge-offs. Conversely, a decrease in interest rates or a mismatching of maturities of interest sensitive financial instruments could result in an acceleration in the prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities and impact ASB’s ability to reinvest its liquidity in similar yielding assets.ASB relies on customer deposits as a sizable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. Changes in market interest rates impact the interest paid on deposits and can significantly impact the Bank’s net interest income. Changes in interest rates may also impact the level of low-cost core deposits that the Bank’s customers maintain in their accounts, which may require ASB to seek higher costing wholesale borrowings.LIBOR Sunset Transition Risk—Changes in the method for determining London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the potential replacement of LIBOR may affect our loan portfolio and interest income on loans.  On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intended to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. On March 5, 2021, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (IBA), as administrator of LIBOR, publicly announced that it intended to cease publication of one week and two-month USD LIBOR tenors on December 31, 2021 and the remaining USD LIBOR tenors on June 30, 2023. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee composed of large U.S. financial institutions, announced replacement of U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by U.S. Treasury securities called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). ASB has loans and other financial instruments with rates that are either directly or indirectly tied to LIBOR. Failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact the Bank’s reputation.ASB has formed a cross-functional project team to oversee the transition. The project team reports to Management and the Board on a periodic basis. The project team is organized around key work streams which cover products, systems and operational processes impacted by the transition as well as client communication. The project team has completed an inventory 29of existing LIBOR-indexed products, which are monitored on an ongoing basis. In addition, the project team has retired all LIBOR-based originations as of December 31, 2021 and continues to offer floating rate loans with alternative indices, including SOFR. ASB will continue to monitor legacy contracts and will continue the orderly transition away from LIBOR by June 30, 2023 in accordance with the OCC and other federal financial institution regulatory agencies’ statement on LIBOR transition.Credit Risk—ASB’s allowance for credit losses may not cover actual loan losses.  ASB’s allowance for credit losses is ASB’s estimate of lifetime expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit and is based on a continuing assessment of:•existing risks in the loan portfolio;•historical loss experience with ASB’s loans;•changes in collateral value; •current conditions (for example, economic conditions, real estate market conditions and interest rate environment); and•reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount.If ASB’s actual loan losses exceed its allowance for credit losses, it may incur losses, its financial condition may be materially and adversely affected, and additional capital may be required to enhance its capital position. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, regularly review the adequacy of ASB’s allowance. These agencies may require ASB to establish additional allowances based on their judgment of the information available at the time of their examinations. No assurance can be given that ASB will not sustain loan losses in excess of present or future levels of its allowance for credit losses.Operational Risk—ASB’s operations are affected by factors that are beyond its control, that could result in lower revenues, higher expenses or decreased demand for its products and services.  ASB’s results of operations depend primarily on the income generated by the supply of, and demand for, its products and services, which primarily consist of loans and deposit services. ASB’s revenues and expenses may be adversely affected by various factors, including:•local, regional, national and other economic and political conditions that could result in declines in employment and real estate values, which in turn could adversely affect the ability of borrowers to make loan payments and the ability of ASB to recover the full amounts owing to it under defaulted loans;•the ability of borrowers to obtain insurance and the ability of ASB to place insurance where borrowers fail to do so, particularly in the event of catastrophic damage to collateral securing loans made by ASB;•faster than expected loan prepayments that can cause an acceleration of the amortization of premiums on loans and investments and the impairment of mortgage servicing assets of ASB;•changes in ASB’s loan portfolio credit profiles and asset quality, which may increase or decrease the required level of allowance for credit losses;•technological disruptions affecting ASB’s operations or financial or operational difficulties experienced by any outside vendor on whom ASB relies to provide key components of its business operations, such as business processing, network access or internet connections;•events of default and foreclosure of loans whereby ASB becomes the owner of mortgage properties that presents environmental risk or potential clean up liability;•the impact of legislative and regulatory changes, including changes affecting capital requirements, increasing oversight of and reporting by banks, or affecting the lending programs or other business activities of ASB;•additional legislative changes regulating the assessment of overdraft, interchange and credit card fees, which can have a negative impact on noninterest income;•public opinion about ASB and financial institutions in general, which, if negative, could impact the public’s trust and confidence in ASB and adversely affect ASB’s ability to attract and retain customers and expose ASB to adverse legal and regulatory consequences;•increases in operating costs (including employee compensation expense and benefits and regulatory compliance costs), inflation and other factors, that exceed increases in ASB’s net interest, fee and other income; and•the ability of ASB to maintain or increase the level of deposits, ASB’s lowest costing funds.Banking Regulatory Risk—Banking and related regulations could result in significant restrictions being imposed on ASB’s business or in a requirement that HEI divest ASB.  ASB is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the Department of Treasury, the OCC and the FDIC, and is subject to reserve requirements established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In addition, the FRB is responsible for regulating ASB’s holding companies, HEI and ASB Hawaii. The regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies to address not only ASB’s compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations, but also capital adequacy, asset quality, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity and various other factors.30Under certain circumstances, including any determination that ASB’s relationship with HEI results in an unsafe and unsound banking practice, these regulatory authorities have the authority to restrict the ability of ASB to transfer assets and to make distributions to its shareholders (including payment of dividends to HEI), or they could seek to require HEI to sever its relationship with or divest its ownership of ASB. Payment by ASB of dividends to HEI may also be restricted by the OCC and FRB under its prompt corrective action regulations or its capital distribution regulations if ASB’s capital position deteriorates. In order to maintain its status as a QTL, ASB is required to maintain at least 65% of its assets in “qualified thrift investments.” Institutions that fail to maintain QTL status are subject to various penalties, including limitations on their activities. In ASB’s case, the activities of HEI and HEI’s other subsidiaries would also be subject to restrictions, and a failure or inability to comply with those restrictions could effectively result in the required divestiture of ASB. Federal legislation has also been proposed in the past that could operate to eliminate the thrift charter or the grandfathered status of HEI as a unitary thrift holding company, which in turn would result in a required divestiture of ASB. In the event of a required divestiture, federal law substantially limits the types of entities that could potentially acquire ASB.Bank Regulatory Risk - Heightened regulatory requirements if ASB’s total assets exceed $10 billion.  As of December 31, 2022, ASB had total assets of approximately $9.5 billion and it is possible that total assets could exceed $10 billion in the near future. The Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations impose enhanced supervisory requirements on financial institutions with more than $10 billion in total assets. For financial institutions with more than $10 billion in total assets, such requirements include, among other things:•Applicability of Volcker Rule requirements and restrictions;•Increased capital leverage, liquidity and risk management standards;•Examinations by the CFPB for compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations; and•Limits on interchange fees on debit cards (Durbin Amendment).The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA), which was enacted in 2018, amended the Dodd-Frank Act to raise the $10 billion stress testing threshold to $250 billion, among other things. The federal financial regulators issued final rules in 2019 to increase the threshold for these stress testing requirements from $10 billion to $250 billion, consistent with the EGRRCPA.ASB is already subject to limits for its interchange fees on debit cards as the Bank’s parent company, HEI, has total assets exceeding $10 billion and the Durbin Amendment did not exclude unitary thrift holding companies from the threshold for holding company assets subject to interchange fee limits.Federal financial regulators may require ASB to take actions to prepare for compliance with the foregoing requirements before it exceeds $10 billion in total assets. ASB’s regulators may consider its preparation for compliance with these regulatory requirements when examining the Bank’s operations or considering any request for regulatory approval. ASB may, therefore, incur compliance costs before it reaches $10 billion in total assets and may be required to maintain the additional compliance procedures even if the Bank does not grow at the anticipated rate or at all.Failure to comply with these new requirements may negatively impact the results of ASB’s operations and financial condition. To ensure compliance, the Bank may be required to invest significant resources, which may necessitate hiring additional personnel and implementing additional internal controls. These additional compliance costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Legislative Risk—Legislative and regulatory initiatives could have an adverse effect on ASB’s business.  From time to time, new legislative and other regulatory initiatives are enacted, which could have an adverse effect on ASB’s business. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July 2010, has had a substantial impact on the financial services industry. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on ASB’s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Product Concentration Risk—A large percentage of ASB’s loans and securities are collateralized by real estate, and adverse changes in the real estate market and/or general economic or other conditions may result in loan losses and adversely affect the Company’s profitability.  As of December 31, 2022 approximately 83% of ASB’s loan portfolio was comprised of loans primarily collateralized by real estate, most of which was concentrated in the State of Hawaii. During 2022, ASB’s home equity lines of credit (HELOC) increased 20% and the residential 1-4 family portfolios increased by 8%, comprising approximately 70% of total real estate loans. ASB’s financial results may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions, either nationally or in the state. ASB had been pursuing a strategy that included expanding its commercial, commercial real estate and consumer lines of business. Commercial and commercial real estate loans have a higher risk profile than residential loans, in part due to larger average balances than residential loans. Though both commercial and commercial real estate loans have shorter terms and earn higher spreads than residential mortgage loans, these loan types 31generally entail higher underwriting and other service costs and present greater credit risks than traditional residential mortgages. Commercial loans are secured by the assets of the business and, upon default, any collateral repossessed may not be sufficient to repay the outstanding loan balance. In addition, loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and, thus, are more likely to be affected by current economic conditions and adverse business developments. Commercial real estate properties tend to be unique and are more difficult to value than residential real estate properties. Commercial real estate loans may not be fully amortizing, meaning that they have a significant principal balance or “balloon” payment due at maturity. In addition, commercial real estate properties, particularly industrial and warehouse properties, are generally subject to relatively greater environmental risks than noncommercial properties and to the corresponding burdens and costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Also, there may be costs and delays involved in enforcing rights of a property owner against tenants in default under terms of leases with respect to commercial properties. For example, a tenant may seek protection under bankruptcy laws, which could result in termination of the tenant’s lease.ASB also has a national syndicated lending portfolio where ASB is a participant in credit facilities agented by established and reputable national lenders. Management selectively chooses each deal based on conservative credit criteria to ensure a high-quality, well diversified portfolio. In the event the borrower encounters financial difficulties and ASB is unable to sell its participation interest in the loan in the secondary market, ASB is typically reliant on the originating lender for managing any loan workout or foreclosure proceedings that may become necessary. Accordingly, ASB has less control over such proceedings than loans it originates and may be required to accommodate the interests of other participating lenders in resolving delinquencies or defaults on participated loans, which could result in outcomes that are not fully consistent with ASB’s preferred strategies. In addition, a significant proportion of ASB’s syndicated loans are originated in states other than Hawaii and are subject to the local regional and regulatory risks specific to those states.Similar to the national syndicated lending portfolio, ASB does not service commercial loans in which it has participation interests rather than being the lead or agent lender and is subject to the policies and practices of the agent lender, who is the loan servicer, in resolving delinquencies or defaults on participated loans.The consumer loan portfolio primarily consists of personal unsecured loans with risk-based pricing. Repayment is based on the borrower’s financial stability as these loans have no collateral and there is less assurance that ASB will be able to collect all payments due under these loans or have sufficient collateral to cover all outstanding loan balances.General Risk Factors
.ESG Risk—Increased scrutiny and changing stakeholder expectations with respect to our environmental, social and governance (ESG) programs may result in increased costs and expenses and may expose the Company to new or incremental risks.  Companies across all industries, including HEI, face increasing stakeholder scrutiny related to ESG practices. These stakeholders include investors, customers, consumers, employees, lenders and other stakeholders, and in recent years, certain stakeholders have placed increasing importance on the impact and social cost of their investments. This increased focus and activism related to ESG may hinder the cost of, or access to, capital or financing as these investors or lenders may elect to increase their required returns on capital offered to the company, reallocate capital or not commit capital as a result of their assessment of a company’s ESG risk profile. Additionally, if the Company fails to adapt, or is perceived to have failed in addressing investor, lender, and other stakeholder ESG expectations or standards, which continue to evolve, or if the Company fails to fully and accurately report its progress on managing risk under its ESG initiatives, the Company may suffer reputational damage and its business or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.Human Capital Risk—HEI’s businesses may be unable to attract, hire, engage and retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce, including senior management, which could affect the Company’s execution of its growth strategy and profitability and adversely affect its future performance.  The skill and experience of the Company’s employees, particularly with respect to the senior management team, are vital to the Company’s success. The management teams of HEI’s businesses have significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent, to develop and implement adequate succession plans for the senior management team, or to maintain a successful work culture that fosters collaboration, innovation, and good communication could disrupt the Company’s operations and adversely affect its businesses and its future success. In addition, a variety of economic and social factors are exacerbating the current labor supply shortage, which may make it difficult to staff critical positions and retain key employees, and could result in significantly higher costs to maintain appropriate staffing levels with the right talent. The inability to fill these positions or a delay in staffing these positions could have a significant impact on the Company’s initiatives and strategies, which in turn would adversely affect the Company’s businesses and their future prospects.Inflation Risk—The Company’s costs and expenses could increase as a result of inflationary pressures and such increases may not be fully offset by an increase in revenues.  A variety of economic and social factors have recently driven inflation to levels above the Federal Reserve Board’s long-term target of 2%. Long-term inflationary pressures could result in higher labor, fuel oil, commodities, materials and supplies, outside services and capital costs, among others, that may not fully be offset by 32an increase in revenues, which would adversely affect the Company’s profitability and results of operations. For example, while the Utilities’ annual revenue adjustment mechanism provides for an annual inflationary adjustment, recent months’ annualized rates of inflation have surpassed the rate of the last inflationary adjustment for the Utilities’ target revenues. To the extent the Utilities’ increase in actual expenses exceeds the amount provided by the last inflationary adjustment and the Utilities are unable to offset such excess with other efficiencies or cost savings, the Utilities’ profitability could be adversely impacted. Similarly, to the extent that higher labor and other costs at ASB, due to inflation or other factors, is not fully offset by an increase in non-interest income or net interest income, which is dependent on interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, earning assets growth and low-cost deposit liabilities, the Bank’s profitability and results of operations would be adversely impacted.Pension Liability Risk—HEI and Hawaiian Electric and their subsidiaries may incur higher retirement benefits expenses and have and will likely continue to be subject to substantial liabilities for retirement benefits.  Retirement benefits expenses and cash funding requirements could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the performance of the U.S. equity markets, trends in interest rates and health care costs, plan amendments, mortality improvements, new laws relating to pension funding and changes in accounting principles. For the Utilities, however, retirement benefits expenses, as adjusted by the pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions (OPEB) tracking mechanisms, have been an allowable expense for rate-making purposes.Tax Legislation Risk—Adverse tax rulings or developments or changes in tax legislation could result in significant increases in tax payments and/or expense.  Governmental taxing authorities could challenge a tax return position taken by HEI or its subsidiaries and if the taxing authorities prevail, HEI’s consolidated tax payments and/or expense, including applicable penalties and interest, could increase significantly. Additionally, changes in tax legislation or IRS interpretations could increase the Company’s tax burden and adversely affect the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Litigation Risk—The Company could be subject to the risk of uninsured losses in excess of its accruals for litigation matters.  HEI and its subsidiaries are involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of their businesses, most of which is covered by insurance (subject to policy limits and deductibles). However, other litigation may arise that is not routine or involves claims that may not be covered by insurance. Because of the uncertainties associated with litigation, there is a risk that litigation against HEI or its subsidiaries, even if vigorously defended, could result in costs of defense and judgment or settlement amounts not covered by insurance and in excess of reserves established in HEI’s consolidated financial statements.Changes in Accounting Estimates Risk—Changes in accounting principles and estimates could affect the reported amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities or revenues and expenses.  HEI’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Changes in accounting principles (including the possible adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards or new U.S. accounting standards), or changes in the Company’s application of existing accounting principles, could materially affect the financial statement presentation of HEI’s or the Utilities’ consolidated results of operations and/or financial condition. Further, in preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the amounts reported for electric utility revenues; allowance for credit losses; income taxes; investment securities, property, plant and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; derivatives; pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; and contingencies and litigation.Changes in accounting principles can also impact HEI’s consolidated financial statements. For example, if management determines that a PPA requires the consolidation of the IPP in the financial statements, the consolidation could have a material effect on Hawaiian Electric’s and HEI’s consolidated financial statements, including the recognition of a significant amount of assets and liabilities and, if such a consolidated IPP were operating at a loss and had insufficient equity, the potential recognition of such losses"
17,HE,HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC INDS,2022-02-25,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORSThe businesses of HEI and its subsidiaries involve numerous risks which, if realized, could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements. For additional information for certain risk factors enumerated below and other risks of the Company and its operations, see “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” above and HEI’s MD&A, HEI’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Hawaiian Electric’s MD&A and Hawaiian Electric’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”Holding company and company-wide risks.COVID-19—Our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations are being and could continue to be adversely impacted by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Due to the numerous country, state, city and local jurisdictions that have imposed “shelter-in-place” orders or other restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including travel restrictions that directly impact the Hawaii economy, economic activity in the state has been adversely impacted. While many restrictions have been subsequently lifted as vaccination rates increased and new daily case counts moderated, leading to improved economic conditions, new COVID-19 variants, such as Omicron, could require a reinstatement of restrictions that would threaten the ongoing economic recovery. Until the economy recovers more broadly, the Utilities expect that demand for electricity will remain muted and past due accounts receivables at the Utilities could remain at an elevated level, which has an impact on liquidity. While the Utilities expect to recover the difference between PUC approved target revenues and recorded adjusted revenues (regardless of the level of kWh sales) through the revenue balancing account under the decoupling mechanism based on estimated sales, starting on January 1st of the following year, the collection occurs on a lagged basis. If the 20difference to be collected, which needs to be financed in the interim, exceeds the Utilities’ current liquidity sources, there can be no assurance that the Utilities will be able to secure additional liquidity sources at a reasonable cost, or at all, or if the difference becomes so large that it would result in a significant increase in customer bills, whether the PUC will allow recovery of such difference through the revenue balancing account. In addition to lower and lagged collections, the COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in higher costs and expenses. While the Utilities have been granted deferral treatment of certain COVID-19 related costs, such as higher bad debt expense, non-collection of late payment fees, higher financing costs, sequestration costs for mission-critical employees and other costs and expenses, there can be no assurance that the PUC will grant recovery of such costs, and such costs could be material. Additionally, in light of the significant impact that economic conditions have had on residents and businesses in the state, a stipulated settlement between Hawaiian Electric and the Division of Consumer Advocacy of the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, reflecting no base rate increase, was submitted in the Hawaiian Electric 2020 test year rate case, and approved by the PUC in October 2020. While the Utilities were successful in offsetting the no base rate increase with corresponding cost decreases in 2021, such reduction of cost in future periods is not assured and, therefore, the inability to achieve targeted cost savings could adversely affect the Utilities’ results of operations in future periods. ASB’s net interest income has also been adversely impacted by lower interest rates across the curve, which are influenced by economic conditions. Accordingly, an extended economic slowdown could have a significant continuing impact on its net interest income. In addition, while economic conditions improved in 2021, COVID-19 variants, such as Omicron, could lead to an extended economic slowdown that may affect the ability of borrowers to make payments on their loans, which would have an adverse impact on ASB’s provision for credit losses. While the Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to continue to operate through this crisis, there can be no assurance that sufficient liquidity will be available if the slowdown in economic activity continues for an extended period of time or worsens from current levels. The Company continues to closely monitor the situation and will continue to take appropriate actions to operate its businesses and protect its workforce while serving customers and the community. If the current weakness in economic activity persists for an extended period of time or worsens from current levels, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company. These effects could include, but are not limited to:•Disruptions or restrictions on employees’ ability to work effectively due to illness, travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders or other limitations.•The inability of customers, IPPs, contractors, suppliers, creditors and other business partners to fulfill their obligations due to various factors, including, but not limited to, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and wage inflation, which could result in unanticipated project costs. For example, several IPPs have declared force majeure, citing the pandemic, which could potentially result in significant project delays or project cancellations. In addition, several of the recently procured renewable projects have experienced delays or have been declared null and void by the independent power producers due to a number of issues, including supply chain disruptions.•Disruption and volatility in the global credit and financial markets, which may increase the cost of capital and could adversely impact access to capital for the Company and its customers and suppliers.•Further deterioration in economic conditions, or an extension of slow economic activity, which negatively impacts the Company’s earnings and liquidity, could also result in an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or long-lived assets. •Actions taken or may be taken, or decisions made or may be made by the Company, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in legal claims or litigation against the Company.Due to the unprecedented nature of the pandemic and the significant uncertainty it creates, including the unknown severity and duration of the pandemic and the resulting impact it may have on Hawaii businesses and residents of the state, which could also be affected by the pace of distribution, administration, and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine against variants, as well as the proportion of the population vaccinated and boosted, the Company is unable to predict the full extent of the future impact on the Company’s businesses at this time, and those impacts could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.Holding Company Risk—HEI is a holding company that derives its income from its operating subsidiaries and depends on the ability of those subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI and on its own ability to raise capital.  HEI is a legal entity separate and distinct from its various subsidiaries. As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, HEI’s cash flows and consequent ability to service its obligations and pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon its receipt of dividends or other distributions from its operating subsidiaries and its ability to issue common stock or other equity securities and to incur additional debt. The ability of HEI’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI, in turn, is subject to the risks associated with their operations and to contractual and regulatory restrictions, including:21•the provisions of an HEI agreement with the PUC, which could limit the ability of HEI’s principal electric public utility subsidiary, Hawaiian Electric, to pay dividends to HEI in the event that the consolidated common stock equity of the Utilities falls below 35% of total capitalization of the electric utilities;•the provisions of an HEI agreement entered into with federal bank regulators in connection with its acquisition of its bank subsidiary, ASB, which requires HEI to contribute additional capital to ASB (up to a maximum amount of additional capital of $28.3 million as of December 31, 2021 under the Regulatory Capital Maintenance/Dividend Agreement dated May 26, 1988, between HEI, HEIDI (HEI Diversified Inc.) and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation) upon request of the regulators in order to maintain ASB’s regulatory capital at the level required by regulation;•obligations under federal law and Federal Reserve Board policy, which require that a savings and loan holding company serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for any FDIC-insured depository institution that it controls, and accordingly, if ASB were to be in financial distress or to otherwise be viewed by the regulators as in unsatisfactory condition, HEI could be required to provide additional capital or liquidity support or take other action, in support of ASB;•the minimum capital and capital distribution regulations of the OCC that are applicable to ASB and capital regulations that become applicable to HEI and ASB Hawaii;•the receipt of a letter from the FRB communicating the OCC’s and the FRB’s non-objection to the payment of any dividend ASB proposes to declare and pay to ASB Hawaii and HEI; and•the provisions of preferred stock resolutions and debt instruments of HEI and its subsidiaries.Credit and Capital Market Risk—The Company, and its credit rating, is subject to risks associated with the Hawaii economy (in the aggregate and on an individual island basis), volatile U.S. capital markets and changes in the interest rate and credit market environment that have or could result in higher retirement benefit plan funding requirements, declines in ASB’s interest rate margins and investment values, higher delinquencies and charge-offs in ASB’s loan portfolio and restrictions on the ability of HEI or its subsidiaries to borrow money or issue securities.  The two largest components of Hawaii’s economy are tourism and the federal government (including the military). Because the core businesses of HEI’s subsidiaries are providing local public electric utility services (through Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries) and banking services (through ASB) in Hawaii, the Company’s operating results are significantly influenced by: Hawaii’s economy, which in turn is influenced by economic conditions in the mainland U.S. (particularly California) and Asia (particularly Japan) as a result of the impact of those conditions on tourism; by the impact of interest rates on the construction and real estate industries and by the impact of federal government spending in Hawaii, which can be affected by world conditions; and, from time to time, the expiration of federal government appropriations bills. In addition, the Hawaii economy could be directly or indirectly affected by implications and potential impacts of U.S. and foreign capital and credit market conditions and federal, state and international responses to those conditions and the potential impacts of global and local developments (including economic conditions and uncertainties; unrest, terrorist acts, wars, conflicts, political protests, deadly virus epidemic, pandemics, or other crisis; the effects of changes that have or may occur in U.S. policy, such as with respect to immigration and trade).    HEI’s and Hawaiian Electric’s securities ratings only reflect the view, at the time the ratings are issued, of the applicable rating agency. There is no assurance that any such credit rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such rating will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agency if, in such rating agency’s judgment, circumstances, such as current, past or future effects or events so warrant. Any such lowering, suspension or withdrawal of any rating may have an adverse effect on the availability of capital to the Company or the market price or marketability of HEI’s and/or Hawaiian Electric’s securities, which could increase the cost of capital of HEI and Hawaiian Electric, and such increased costs, including interest charges, under HEI’s and/or Hawaiian Electric’s debt securities and credit facilities, would result in reductions in HEI’s consolidated net income in future periods. Further, if HEI’s or Hawaiian Electric’s commercial paper ratings were to be downgraded, HEI and Hawaiian Electric might not be able to sell commercial paper and might be required to draw on more expensive bank lines of credit or to defer capital or other expenditures. Neither HEI nor Hawaiian Electric management can predict future rating agency actions or their effects on the future cost of capital of HEI or Hawaiian Electric. Such ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold any securities; such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies; and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.Changes in the U.S. capital markets can also have significant effects on the Company. For example, pension funding requirements are affected by the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for pension plans, and by the discount rate used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost and value obligations. The Utilities’ pension tracking mechanisms help moderate pension expense; however, a significant reduction in the discount rate or in the value of the Company’s defined benefit pension plan assets could result in a substantial increase in the gap between the projected benefit obligations under the plans and the value of plan assets, resulting in increases in funding requirements.22Because the earnings of ASB depend primarily on net interest income, interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASB’s operations. HEI and the Utilities are also exposed to interest rate risk primarily due to their periodic borrowing requirements, the discount rate used to determine pension funding requirements and the possible effect of interest rates on the electric utilities’ rates of return. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors, including general economic conditions and the policies of government and regulatory authorities. HEI cannot predict future changes in interest rates, nor be certain that interest rate risk management strategies it or its subsidiaries have implemented will be successful in managing interest rate risk.Interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting the fair value of ASB’s investment securities. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair values of those instruments, respectively. Disruptions in the credit markets, a liquidity crisis in the banking industry or increased levels of residential mortgage delinquencies and defaults may result in decreases in the fair value of ASB’s investment securities and an impairment, requiring ASB to write down its investment securities. As of December 31, 2021, ASB’s investment in U.S. Treasury, federal agency obligations, and mortgage-backed securities have an implicit guarantee from the U.S. government.Geographic Concentration Risk—The Company is subject to the risks associated with the geographic concentration of its businesses and current lack of interconnections that could result in service interruptions at the Utilities or higher default rates on loans held by ASB.  The business of the Utilities is concentrated on the individual islands they serve in the State of Hawaii. Their operations are more vulnerable to service interruptions than that of many U.S. mainland utilities because none of the systems of the Utilities are interconnected with the systems on the other islands they serve. Because of this lack of interconnections, it is necessary to maintain higher generation reserve margins than are typical for U.S. mainland utilities to help ensure reliable service. Service interruptions, including in particular extended interruptions that could result from a natural disaster or terrorist activity, could adversely impact the revenues and costs of some or all of the Utilities.Substantially all of ASB’s consumer loan customers are Hawaii residents. A significant portion of the commercial loan customers are also located in Hawaii. While a majority of customers are on Oahu, ASB also has customers on the neighbor islands (whose economies have been weaker than Oahu’s economy during the last economic downturn). Substantially all of the real estate underlying ASB’s residential and commercial real estate loans are located in Hawaii. These assets may be subject to a greater risk of default than other comparable assets held by financial institutions with other geographic concentrations in the event of adverse economic, political or business developments or natural disasters affecting Hawaii and affect the ability of ASB’s customers to make payments of principal and interest on their loans.Competitive and Technological Risk—Increasing competition and technological advances could cause HEI’s businesses to lose customers or render their operations obsolete.  The banking industry in Hawaii, and certain aspects of the electric utility industry, are competitive. The success of HEI’s subsidiaries in meeting competition and responding to technological advances will continue to have a direct impact on HEI’s consolidated financial performance. For example:•ASB, one of the largest financial institutions in the state, is in direct competition for deposits and loans not only with two larger institutions that have substantial capital, technology and marketing resources, but also with smaller Hawaii institutions and other U.S. institutions, including credit unions, mutual funds, mortgage brokers, finance companies, non-traditional providers of financial services and investment banking firms. Larger financial institutions may have greater access to capital at lower costs, which could impair ASB’s ability to compete effectively. New or significant advances in technology (e.g., significant advances in internet or mobile banking) or customer adoption of alternative banking channels could render the operations of ASB less competitive or obsolete. •The Utilities face competition from IPPs; customer self-generation, with or without cogeneration; customer energy storage; and the potential formation of community-based, cooperative ownership or municipality structures for electrical service on all islands it serves. With the exception of certain identified projects, the Utilities are required to use competitive bidding to acquire a future generation resource unless the PUC finds competitive bidding to be unsuitable. The PUC sets policies for distributed generation interconnection agreements and standby rates. The results of competitive bidding, competition from IPPs, customer self-generation, and potential cooperative ownership or municipality structures for electric utility service, and the rate at which technological developments facilitating nonutility generation of electricity, combined heat and power technology, off-grid microgrids, and customer energy storage may render the operations of the Utilities less competitive or outdated and adversely affect the Utilities and the results of their operations. Cybersecurity Risk—The Company may be subject to information technology and operational system failures, network disruptions, cyber attacks and breaches in data security that could adversely affect its businesses and reputation. The Company and its subsidiaries rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed or hosted by third party service providers, to manage its business data, communications, and other business processes. Such information technology systems may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or other security incidents, which could result in unauthorized access to confidential data, ransomware demands or disruptions to operations. In addition, there is increasing cybersecurity risk associated with the broad 23adoption of a remote working environment as a result of the pandemic. If the Company is unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve an incident, it may have a material impact on the Company’s operations or business reputation.Utilities.  The Utilities rely on evolving and increasingly complex operational and information systems, networks and other technologies, which are interconnected with the systems and network infrastructure owned by third parties to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, invoicing and collection of payments, customer relationship management, human resource management, the acquisition, generation and delivery of electrical service to customers, and to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting and legal and tax requirements. The Utilities use their systems and infrastructure to create, collect, store, and process sensitive information, including personal information regarding customers, employees and their dependents, retirees, and other individuals. Despite the Utilities security measures, all of their systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access caused by natural disasters, cybersecurity incidents, security breaches, user error, unintentional defects created by system changes, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures or similar events. Any such failure could have a material adverse impact on the Utilities’ ability to process transactions and provide service, as well the Utilities’ financial condition and results of operations. Further, a data breach involving theft, improper disclosure, or other unauthorized access to or acquisition of confidential information could subject the Utilities to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, claims by third parties, and enforcement actions by government agencies. A data breach could also reduce the value of proprietary information, and harm the reputation of the Utilities.As noted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the utility industry is continuing to experience an increase in the frequency and sophistication of cybersecurity incidents. The Utilities’ systems have been, and will likely continue to be, a target of attacks. Further, the Utilities’ operational networks may be subject to new cybersecurity risks due to modernizing and interconnecting existing infrastructure with new technologies and control systems, including those owned by third parties.  Although the Utilities have not experienced a material cybersecurity breach to date, such incidents may occur and may have a material adverse effect on the Utilities and the Company in the future. In order to address cybersecurity risks to their information systems, the Utilities maintain security measures designed to protect their information technology systems, network infrastructure and other assets. The Utilities actively monitor developments in the area of cybersecurity and are involved in various related government and industry groups, and brief the Company’s Board quarterly on relevant cybersecurity issues. Although the Utilities continue to make investments in their cybersecurity program, including personnel, technologies, cyber insurance and training of Utilities personnel, there can be no assurance that these systems or their expected functionality will be implemented, maintained, or expanded effectively; nor can security measures completely eliminate the possibility of a cybersecurity breach. The Utility maintains cyber liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents. However, there is no guarantee that adequate insurance will continue to be available at rates the Utility believes are reasonable or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates. If the Utilities’ cybersecurity measures were to be breached, the Utilities could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to their reputations.Due to the size, scope and complexity of the Utilities’ business, the development and maintenance of information technology systems to process and track information is critical and challenging. The Utilities often rely on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems and these third-party vendors could cease to exist, fail to establish adequate processes to protect the Utilities systems and information, experience supply chain compromises or other internal or external security incidents. In addition, the Utilities are pursuing complex business transformation initiatives, which include the implementation of new systems and the upgrade or replacement of existing systems. Significant system changes increase the risk of system interruptions. Although the Utilities maintain change control processes to mitigate this risk, system interruptions may occur. Further, delay or failure to complete the integration of information systems and processes may result in delays in regulatory cost recovery, or the failure to realize the benefits anticipated to be derived from these initiatives.The Utilities have disaster recovery plans in place to protect their businesses from information technology service interruptions. The disaster recovery plans, however, may not be successful in preventing the loss of customer data, service interruptions and disruptions to operations or damage to important facilities. If any of these systems fail to operate properly or becomes disabled and the Utilities’ disaster recovery plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, the Utilities could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to their reputations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities’ and the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.ASB.  ASB is highly dependent on its ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions and relies heavily on communication and information systems, including those of third-party vendors and other service providers. Communication and information system failures can result from a variety of risks including, but not limited to, events that are wholly or partially out of ASB’s control, such as communication line integrity, weather, terrorist acts, natural disasters, accidental disasters, unauthorized breaches of security systems, energy delivery systems, cyberattacks and other events.24ASB is under continuous threat of loss due to cyberattacks, especially as ASB continues to expand customer capabilities to utilize the Internet and other digital channels to transact business. Two of the most significant cyberattack risks that ASB faces are e-fraud and loss of sensitive customer data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals extract funds directly from customers’ or ASB’s accounts using fraudulent schemes that may include Internet-based funds transfers. ASB has been subject to e-fraud incidents historically. Loss of sensitive customer data are attempts to steal sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, through unauthorized access to computer systems, including computer hacking. Such attacks are less frequent, but could present significant reputational, legal and regulatory costs if successful. Intrusion detection and prevention systems, anti-virus software, firewalls and other general information technology controls have been put in place to detect and prevent cyberattacks or information system breaches. A disaster recovery plan has been developed in the event of a natural disaster, security breach, military or terrorist action, power or communication failure or similar event. The disaster recovery plan, however, may not be successful in preventing the loss of customer data, service interruptions, disruptions to operations or damage to important facilities. Although ASB devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of ASB’s computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to ASB and its customers, there can be no assurance that such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately corrected by ASB or its vendors.If any of these systems fail to operate properly or become disabled even for a brief period of time, ASB could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to its reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on ASB’s and the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. Uninsured Losses—HEI’s businesses could suffer losses that are uninsured due to a lack of affordable insurance coverage, unavailability of insurance coverage or limitations on the insurance coverage the Company does have.  In the ordinary course of business, HEI and its subsidiaries purchase insurance coverages (e.g., property and liability coverages) to protect against loss of, or damage to, their properties and against claims made by third parties and employees for property damage or personal injuries. However, the protection provided by such insurance is limited in significant respects and, in some instances, there is no coverage. Some of the insurance coverages have substantial deductibles or has limits on the maximum amounts that may be recovered. In common with other companies in its line of business, the Utilities’ overhead and underground transmission and distribution systems (with the exception of substation buildings and contents), which have a replacement value roughly estimated at $8 billion, are largely not insured against loss or damage because the amount of transmission and distribution system insurance capacity is limited and the premiums are cost prohibitive. Similarly, the Utilities have no business interruption insurance as the premiums for such insurance would be cost prohibitive, particularly since the Utilities are not interconnected to other systems. If a hurricane or other uninsured catastrophic natural disaster were to occur, and if the PUC did not allow the affected Utilities to recover from ratepayers restoration costs and revenues lost from business interruption, the lost revenues and repair expenses could result in a significant decrease in HEI’s consolidated net income or in significant net losses for the affected periods.ASB generally does not obtain credit enhancements, such as mortgagor bankruptcy insurance, but does require standard hazard and hurricane insurance and may require flood insurance for certain properties. ASB is subject to the risks of borrower defaults and bankruptcies, special hazard losses not covered by the required insurance and the insurance company’s inability to pay claims on existing policies.Environmental Regulation—Increased federal and state environmental regulation will require an increasing commitment of resources and funds and could result in construction delays or penalties and fines for non-compliance. HEI and its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, hazardous substances, waste management, natural resources and health and safety, which regulate, among other matters, the operation of existing facilities, the construction and operation of new facilities and the proper cleanup and disposal of hazardous and toxic wastes and substances. These laws and regulations could result in increased capital, operating, and other costs. HEI or its subsidiaries are currently involved in investigatory or remedial actions at current, former or third-party sites and there is no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs relating to these sites. In addition, compliance with these legal requirements requires the Utilities to commit significant resources and funds toward, among other things, environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment and payment of emission fees. These laws and regulations, among other things, require that certain environmental permits be obtained in order to construct or operate certain facilities, and obtaining such permits can entail significant expense and cause substantial construction delays. Also, these laws and regulations may be amended from time to time, including amendments that increase the burden and cost of compliance. For example, emission and/or discharge limits may be tightened, more extensive permitting requirements may be imposed and additional substances may become regulated. In addition, significant regulatory uncertainty exists regarding the impact of federal or state greenhouse gas emission limits and reductions.25If HEI or its subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond their control, that failure may result in civil or criminal penalties and fines or the cessation of operations that could have a material adverse on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Electric utility risks.    The following risks are generally specific to Hawaiian Electric, but could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Regulatory Risk—Actions of the PUC are outside the control of the Utilities and could result in inadequate or untimely rate increases, in rate reductions or refunds or in unanticipated delays, expenses or writedowns in connection with the construction of new projects.  The rates the Utilities are allowed to charge for their services and the timeliness of permitted rate increases are among the most important items influencing the Utilities’ results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The PUC has broad discretion over the rates that the Utilities charge their customers. On December 23, 2020, as part of the D&O establishing a new PBR Framework, there will be a five-year Multi-year Rate Period (MRP) during which there will be no general rate cases. In the fourth year of the MRP, the PUC will comprehensively review the PBR Framework to determine if any modifications or revisions are appropriate. Any adverse decision by the PUC concerning the level or method of determining electric utility rates at the end of the multi-year rate period including the items and amounts that may be included in rate base, the returns on equity or rate base found to be reasonable, the potential consequences of exceeding or not meeting such returns, the denial of exceptional project recovery applications during the multi-year rate period, adverse impact of adjustments made to the PBR Framework, decisions on recovery of exogenous items under the PBR Framework, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding could have a material adverse effect on Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.To improve the timing and certainty of the recovery of their costs, the Utilities have proposed and/or received approval of various cost recovery mechanisms, including an ECRC (includes a PUC-ordered 98%/2% risk-sharing split between customers and the Utilities for fossil fuel price variations from baseline prices, with a current annual aggregate exposure cap of +/- $3.7 million), a PPAC, and pension and OPEB tracking mechanisms, as well as a decoupling mechanism, an exceptional project recovery mechanism (EPRM) (formerly major project interim recovery (MPIR) adjustment mechanism), and a Renewable Energy Infrastructure Program (REIP) surcharge. A change in, or the elimination of, any of these cost recovery mechanisms, could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities. See “Regulatory mechanisms” in Electric Utility’s Business.Under the new PBR Framework, the Utilities’ annual revenue adjustment (ARA) includes a customer dividend consisting of a negative adjustment of 0.22% compounded annually and a flow through of the “pre-PBR” savings commitment from the management audit recommendations developed in the 2020 test year rate case. The ability of the Utilities to recover increasing costs and earn a reasonable return on capital investments not covered by the annual revenue adjustment (ARA) or not achieving the customer dividend and cost savings commitment could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities. Under the new PBR Framework, the existing PIMs continue, and the PUC established new PIMs and is working on additional PIMs with stakeholders. Not meeting the PIMs that have penalties for not achieving performance incentive goals or PIMs that would contribute to the Utilities’ ability to achieve their allowed ROACEs could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities. Based on the current operations of the Utilities and regulatory framework, including the impact of the newly approved PBR Framework, the Utilities continue to follow regulatory accounting under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 980. Continued accounting in this manner requires that certain criteria relating to the recoverability of such costs through rates be met, including achieved financial results that support the recovery of costs. If events or circumstances should change, such that the criteria are no longer satisfied, the Utilities expect that their regulatory assets (amounting to $566 million as of December 31, 2021), net of regulatory liabilities (amounting to $997 million as of December 31, 2021), would be charged to the statement of income in the period of discontinuance. See “Performance-based regulation framework” in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.The Utilities could be required to refund to their customers, with interest, revenues that have been or may be received under interim rate orders in their rate case proceedings and other proceedings, if and to the extent they exceed the amounts allowed in final orders.Many public utility projects require PUC approval and various permits (e.g., environmental and land use permits) from other governmental agencies. Difficulties in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, the necessary approvals or permits, or any adverse decision or policy made or adopted, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision, by an agency with respect to such approvals and permits, can result in significantly increased project costs or even cancellation of projects. In the event a project does not proceed, or if the PUC disallows cost recovery for all or part of a project, or if project costs exceed caps imposed by 26the PUC in its approval of the project, project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could result in significant reductions in Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated net income. There is significant uncertainty around the potential impacts related to the recent surge in COVID-19 and the variant strains. See risk factor, “COVID-19—Our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations are being and could continue to be adversely impacted by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic” in the “Holding company and company-wide” risk factor section for a discussion regarding the risks related to the recovery of deferred COVID-19 costs and expenses.Weather Conditions Risk—Electric utility operations are significantly influenced by weather conditions and natural disasters.  The Utilities’ results of operations can be affected by the weather and natural disasters. Weather conditions, particularly temperature and humidity, directly influence the demand for electricity. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, lava flows and lightning storms, some of which may become more severe or frequent as a result of global climate changes, have occurred in the past and will likely continue to occur in the future. When these events occur, they can cause outages and property damage and require the Utilities to incur significant additional expenses that may not be recoverable.Climate Change Risk—Electric utility operations may be significantly influenced by climate change.  While the timing, extent and ultimate effects of climate change cannot be determined with any certainty, climate change is predicted to result in sea level rise, which could potentially impact coastal and other low-lying areas (where much of the Utilities’ electric infrastructure is sited), and could cause erosion of beaches, saltwater intrusion into aquifers and surface ecosystems, higher water tables and increased flooding and storm damage due to heavy rainfall. The effects of climate change on the weather (for example, floods, hurricanes, heat waves or drought conditions, the latter of which could increase wildfire risk), sea levels, and water availability and quality, all have the potential to materially adversely affect the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities. For example, severe weather and its related impacts could cause significant harm to the Utilities’ physical facilities. Third Party Performance Risk—Electric utility operations depend heavily on third-party suppliers of fuel and purchased power.  The Utilities rely on fuel suppliers and shippers, and IPPs to deliver fuel and power, respectively, in accordance with contractual agreements. Approximately 67% of the net energy generated or purchased by the Utilities in 2021 was generated from the burning of fossil fuel oil, and purchases of power by the Utilities provided about 48% of their total net energy generated and purchased for the same period. Failure or delay by fuel suppliers and shippers to provide fuel pursuant to existing contracts, or failure by a major IPP to deliver the firm capacity anticipated in its PPA, could disrupt the ability of the Utilities to deliver electricity, affect the Utilities’ maintenance schedules that could affect future reliability and require the Utilities to incur additional expenses to meet the needs of their customers that may not be recoverable. In addition, as the IPP contracts near the end of their terms, there may be less economic incentive for the IPPs to make investments in their units to ensure the availability of their units. Also, as these contractual agreements end, the Utilities may not be able to purchase fuel and power on terms equivalent to the current contractual agreements.Capacity Risk—The capacity provided by the Utilities’ generating resources and third-party purchased power may not be sufficient to meet customers’ energy requirements.  The Utilities rely upon their generating resources and purchased power from third parties to meet their customers’ energy requirements. The Utilities update their evaluation of long-term generation capacity every three years to determine the Utilities’ ability to meet reasonably expected demands for service and provide reasonable reserves for emergencies and other unplanned events. These evaluations are impacted by a variety of factors, including customer energy demand, energy conservation and efficiency initiatives, economic conditions, and weather patterns. If the capacity provided by the Utilities’ generating resources and third-party purchased power is not adequate relative to customer demand, the Utilities may have to contract to buy more power from third parties, invest in additional generating facilities over the long-term, or extend the operating life of existing utility units. Any failure to meet customer energy requirements could negatively impact the satisfaction of the Utilities’ customers, which could have an adverse impact on the Utilities’ business, reputation and results of operations. Stakeholder Activism Risk—Electric utility and third-party purchased power projects may be significantly impacted by stakeholder activism.  The potential impact of stakeholder activism could increase total utility project costs, and delay the permitting, construction and overall timing or preclude the completion of third-party or utility projects that are required to meet electricity demand, resilience and reliability objectives, and RPS and other climate related goals. If a utility project cannot be completed, the project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could result in significant reductions in Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated net income and negatively impact its financial condition and liquidity. Operational Risk—Electric utility generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated and/or increased operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs.  Operation of electric generating facilities involves certain risks which can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels. Included among these risks are facility shutdowns or power interruptions due to insufficient generation or a breakdown or 27failure of equipment or processes. In addition, operations could be negatively impacted by interruptions in fuel supply, inability to negotiate satisfactory collective bargaining agreements when existing agreements expire or other labor disputes, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements, disruptions in delivery of electricity, operator error and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, fires, explosions, lava flows, floods or other similar occurrences affecting the Utilities’ generating facilities or transmission and distribution systems.Legislative Risk—The Utilities may be adversely affected by new legislation or administrative actions.  Congress, the Hawaii legislature and governmental agencies periodically consider legislation and other initiatives that could have uncertain or negative effects on the Utilities and their customers. Congress, the Hawaii legislature and governmental agencies have adopted, or are considering adopting, a number of measures that will significantly affect the Utilities, as described below.Renewable Portfolio Standards law.  In 2015, Hawaii’s RPS law was amended to require electric utilities to meet an RPS of 15%, 30%, 40%, 70% and 100% by December 31, 2015, 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2045 respectively. Energy savings resulting from energy efficiency programs do not count toward the RPS after 2014. The Utilities are committed to achieving these goals and met the 2015 and 2020 RPS; however, due to the exclusion of energy savings in calculating RPS after 2014 and risks such as potential delays in IPPs being able to deliver contracted renewable energy, it is possible the Utilities may not attain the required renewable percentages in the future, and management cannot predict the future consequences of failure to do so (including potential penalties to be assessed by the PUC). On December 19, 2008, the PUC approved a penalty of $20 for every MWh that an electric utility is deficient under Hawaii’s RPS law. The PUC noted, however, that this penalty may be reduced, in the PUC’s discretion, due to events or circumstances that are outside an electric utility’s reasonable control, to the extent the event or circumstance could not be reasonably foreseen and ameliorated, as described in the RPS law and in an RPS framework adopted by the PUC. In addition, the PUC ordered that the Utilities will be prohibited from recovering any RPS penalty costs through rates.Renewable energy.  In 2007, a measure was passed by the Hawaii legislature stating that the PUC may consider the need for increased renewable energy in rendering decisions on utility matters. Due to this measure, it is possible that, if energy from a renewable source is more expensive than energy from fossil fuel, the PUC may still approve the purchase of energy from the renewable source, resulting in higher costs.Global climate change and greenhouse gas emissions reduction.  National and international concern about climate change and the contribution of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (including carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels) to climate change have led to federal legislative and regulatory proposals and action by the state of Hawaii to reduce GHG emissions. In July 2007, the State Legislature passed Act 234, which requires a statewide reduction of GHG emissions by January 1, 2020 to levels at or below the statewide GHG emission levels in 1990. On June 20, 2014, the Governor signed the final rules required to implement Act 234 and these rules went into effect on June 30, 2014. In general, Act 234 and the GHG rule require affected sources that have the potential to emit GHGs in excess of established thresholds to reduce their GHG emissions by 16% below 2010 emission levels by 2020. In accordance with state requirements, the Utilities submitted an Emissions Reduction Plan (ERP) to the DOH on June 30, 2015, with the most recent revision filed on June 9, 2020, to reflect the partnership established between the Utilities and several IPPs. In this plan, the partnership committed to a 16% reduction in GHG emissions in accordance with the rule, which the partnership achieved in 2017 in advance of the 2020 requirement. The DOH issued the air permits incorporating the ERP including provisions to address the period of unavailability of the PGV facility on Hawaii Island. It is expected that with the advent of additional renewable projects and the application to the PUC with respect to the expansion of the PPA for the PGV project, the goals should be attainable. Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 269-6(b) requires that “in making determinations of the reasonableness of the costs pertaining to electric or gas utility system capital improvements and operations, the PUC shall explicitly consider, quantitatively or qualitatively, the effect of the state’s reliance on fossil fuels on price volatility, export of funds for fuel imports, fuel supply reliability risk, and greenhouse gas emissions.” Based on HRS § 269-6(b) and recent case law discussing the scope of this section, the Utilities are performing GHG analyses to quantitatively or qualitatively describe the GHG emissions of proposed projects that are submitted to the PUC for approval.In June 2018, House Bill 2182 was signed into law as Act 15 and took effect on July 1, 2018. Among its provisions, Act 15 aligned the state’s clean energy and carbon sequestration efforts with climate initiative goals and established a statewide carbon neutral goal by 2045. Under this Act, efforts would be made to “sequester more atmospheric carbon and greenhouse gases than emitted within the state as quickly as practicable, but no later than 2045.” The Hawaii Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission, administratively placed under the State Department of Land and Natural Resources, was charged with endeavoring to achieve the target, and giving consideration to the impact of its plans, decisions and strategies on the state’s ability to attain the goal. The general functions, duties and powers of the Hawaii Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission are set forth in HRS § 225P-3. To achieve its mandates, the Hawaii Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation 28Commission may recommend plans, decisions and strategies that could have an impact on various entities including the Utilities. The Utilities have taken, and continue to identify opportunities to take, direct action to reduce GHG emissions from their operations, including, but not limited to, supporting demand-side management programs that foster energy efficiency, using renewable resources for energy production and purchasing power from IPPs generated by renewable resources, and burning renewable biodiesel at selected Hawaiian Electric and Maui Electric generating units. In November 2021, the Utilities committed to a 70% reduction in power generation GHG emissions by 2030 compared to a 2005 baseline and achievement of net zero carbon emissions from power generation by 2045. While the reduction is not mandated by law, the Utilities could suffer reputational harm if it fails to achieve its commitments, which may negatively impact its business.The foregoing legislation or legislation that now is, or may in the future be, proposed, such as potential carbon “cap and trade” legislation that, if applicable, may fundamentally alter costs to produce electricity and accelerate the move to renewable generation, present risks and uncertainties for the Utilities.Renewable Transition Risk—The Utilities may be subject to increased operational challenges and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely impacted in meeting the commitments and objectives of clean energy initiatives, Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) and other climate related goals.  The far-reaching nature of the Utilities’ renewable energy commitments and the RPS and other climate related goals present risks to the Company. Among such risks are: (1) the potential delay by the Public Utilities Commission of the State of Hawaii (PUC) in considering (and potential disapproval of actual or proposed) renewable energy proposals and related costs; (2) the dependence on outside parties, such as the state, developers and third-party suppliers of renewable purchased energy, which if the Utilities are unsuccessful in negotiating purchased power agreements with such IPPs or if a major IPP delays or fails to deliver the anticipated capacity and/or energy in its purchased power agreement, could impact the Utilities’ achievement of their commitments to RPS and other climate related goals, eligibility for performance incentive mechanisms associated with the speed of increasing renewable generation, the ability to retire fossil fuel units, and/or the Utilities’ ability to deliver reliable service; (3) delays in acquiring or unavailability of non-fossil fuel supplies for renewable generation; (4) the impact of intermittent power to the electrical grid and reliability of service if appropriate supporting infrastructure is not installed or does not operate effectively; (5) the inability to recover the undepreciated cost of fossil fuel generating units if they are required to be retired before the end of their expected useful life; (6) uncertainties surrounding current and future renewable technologies, such as solar power, wind power, biofuels, battery storage, hydro, hydrogen, as well as related environmental assessments required to meet RPS and other climate related goals; (7) the impacts of implementation of the renewable energy proposals on future costs of electricity and potential penalties imposed by the PUC for delays in the commercial operations of renewable energy projects; (8) the likelihood that the Utilities may need to make substantial investments in related infrastructure, which could result in increased borrowings and, therefore, materially impact the financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities; (9) the imputed debt related to the pending renewable power purchase agreements under the stage 1 and stage 2 RFPs could result in a credit rating downgrade for the Utilities and the Company; and (10) the commitment to support a variety of initiatives, which, if approved by the PUC, may have a material impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the Utilities depending on their design and implementation. These initiatives include, but are not limited to, programs to enable more customer-sited generation. The implementation of these or other programs may adversely impact the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities.Retirement of the AES coal plant—Hawaiian Electric’s ability to deliver reliable power could be impacted by the availability of AES’ coal plant for the remainder of the PPA term and by the availability of other generating units with the planned retirement of AES’ coal plant. The AES coal plant provides 180 MW of capacity (approximately 10% of generation) on Oahu and is scheduled for retirement on September 1, 2022. The availability of the AES coal plant as well as the availability of other IPP and utility units directly affects Hawaiian Electric’s maintenance schedules for its own and other IPP generation resources, which in turn could impact Hawaiian Electric’s ability to provide reliable service to its customers. On September 1, 2022, the PPA with AES will terminate and will not be renewed, which will require replacement capacity from other generating resources. Hawaiian Electric believes its plans, including contingency plans, are adequate to ensure reliable service through the transition period. These plans include the anticipated addition of ten renewable energy/storage projects, reserve capacity from existing generation sources, the acceleration of maintenance work during periods with anticipated higher reserve levels, multiple demand response/distributed energy resources programs and a proposed battery project. However, if there were unexpected issues with existing generation, or Hawaiian Electric is not able to implement its plans for replacement generation after September 1, 2022, it could disrupt the ability of Hawaiian Electric to deliver reliable service, result in financial loss that may not be recoverable, cause business disruptions, result in liability to customers, invite regulatory intervention or result in damage to Hawaiian Electric’s reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities’ and the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.29Bank risks.The following risks are generally specific to ASB, but could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Interest Rate Risk—Fluctuations in interest rates could result in lower net interest income, impair ASB’s ability to originate new loans or impair the ability of ASB’s adjustable-rate borrowers to make increased payments or cause such borrowers to repay their adjustable-rate loans.  Interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASB’s operations. ASB’s net interest income consists primarily of interest income received on fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, mortgage-backed securities and investments, less interest expense consisting primarily of interest paid on deposits and other borrowings. Interest rate risk arises when earning assets mature or when their interest rates change in a time frame different from that of the costing liabilities. Changes in market interest rates, including changes in the relationship between short-term and long-term market interest rates (e.g., a flat or an inverted yield curve) or between different interest rate indices, and the duration and severity of the changes in market interest rates can impact ASB’s net interest margin. See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.” Although ASB pursues an asset-liability management strategy designed to mitigate its risk from changes in market interest rates, unfavorable movements in interest rates could result in lower net interest income. Residential 1-4 family fixed-rate mortgage loans comprised about 42% of ASB’s loan portfolio as of December 31, 2021 and do not re-price with movements in interest rates. ASB continues to face a challenging interest rate environment. Increases in market interest rates could have an adverse impact on ASB’s cost of funds. Higher market interest rates could lead to higher interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Significant increases in market interest rates, or the perception that an increase may occur, could adversely affect ASB’s ability to originate new loans and grow. An increase in market interest rates, especially a sudden increase, could also adversely affect the ability of ASB’s adjustable-rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations. If this occurred, it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets and charge-offs. Conversely, a decrease in interest rates or a mismatching of maturities of interest sensitive financial instruments could result in an acceleration in the prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities and impact ASB’s ability to reinvest its liquidity in similar yielding assets.LIBOR Sunset Transition Risk—Changes in the method for determining London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the potential replacement of LIBOR may affect our loan portfolio and interest income on loans.  On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. On March 5, 2021, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (IBA), as administrator of LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to cease publication of one week and two month USD LIBOR tenors on December 31, 2021 and the remaining USD LIBOR tenors on June 30, 2023. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee composed of large U.S. financial institutions, announced replacement of U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by U.S. Treasury securities called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). ASB has loans and other financial instruments with rates that are either directly or indirectly tied to LIBOR. Failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact the Bank’s reputation.ASB has formed a cross-functional project team to oversee the transition. The project team reports to Management and the Board on a periodic basis. The project team is organized around key work streams which cover products, systems and operational processes impacted by the transition as well as client communication. The project team has completed an inventory of existing LIBOR-indexed products, which are monitored on an ongoing basis. In addition, the project team has retired all LIBOR-based originations as of December 31, 2021 and continues to offer floating rate loans with alternative indices, including SOFR. ASB will continue to monitor legacy contracts and will continue the orderly transition away from LIBOR by June 30, 2023 in accordance with the OCC and other federal financial institution regulatory agencies’ statement on LIBOR transition.Credit Risk—ASB’s allowance for credit losses may not cover actual loan losses. ASB’s allowance for credit losses is ASB’s estimate of lifetime expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit and is based on a continuing assessment of:•existing risks in the loan portfolio;•historical loss experience with ASB’s loans;•changes in collateral value; •current conditions (for example, economic conditions, real estate market conditions and interest rate environment) and;•reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount.If ASB’s actual loan losses exceed its allowance for credit losses, it may incur losses, its financial condition may be materially and adversely affected, and additional capital may be required to enhance its capital position. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, regularly review the adequacy of ASB’s allowance. These agencies may require ASB to establish additional allowances based on their judgment of the information available at the time of 30their examinations. No assurance can be given that ASB will not sustain loan losses in excess of present or future levels of its allowance for credit losses.Operational Risk—ASB’s operations are affected by factors that are beyond its control, that could result in lower revenues, higher expenses or decreased demand for its products and services.  ASB’s results of operations depend primarily on the income generated by the supply of, and demand for, its products and services, which primarily consist of loans and deposit services. ASB’s revenues and expenses may be adversely affected by various factors, including:•local, regional, national and other economic and political conditions that could result in declines in employment and real estate values, which in turn could adversely affect the ability of borrowers to make loan payments and the ability of ASB to recover the full amounts owing to it under defaulted loans;•the ability of borrowers to obtain insurance and the ability of ASB to place insurance where borrowers fail to do so, particularly in the event of catastrophic damage to collateral securing loans made by ASB;•faster than expected loan prepayments that can cause an acceleration of the amortization of premiums on loans and investments and the impairment of mortgage servicing assets of ASB;•changes in ASB’s loan portfolio credit profiles and asset quality, which may increase or decrease the required level of allowance for credit losses;•technological disruptions affecting ASB’s operations or financial or operational difficulties experienced by any outside vendor on whom ASB relies to provide key components of its business operations, such as business processing, network access or internet connections;•events of default and foreclosure of loans whereby ASB becomes the owner of mortgage properties that presents environmental risk or potential clean up liability;•the impact of legislative and regulatory changes, including changes affecting capital requirements, increasing oversight of and reporting by banks, or affecting the lending programs or other business activities of ASB;•additional legislative changes regulating the assessment of overdraft, interchange and credit card fees, which can have a negative impact on noninterest income;•public opinion about ASB and financial institutions in general, which, if negative, could impact the public’s trust and confidence in ASB and adversely affect ASB’s ability to attract and retain customers and expose ASB to adverse legal and regulatory consequences;•increases in operating costs (including employee compensation expense and benefits and regulatory compliance costs), inflation and other factors, that exceed increases in ASB’s net interest, fee and other income; and•the ability of ASB to maintain or increase the level of deposits, ASB’s lowest costing funds.Banking Regulatory Risk—Banking and related regulations could result in significant restrictions being imposed on ASB’s business or in a requirement that HEI divest ASB.  ASB is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the Department of Treasury, the OCC and the FDIC, and is subject to reserve requirements established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In addition, the FRB is responsible for regulating ASB’s holding companies, HEI and ASB Hawaii. The regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies to address not only ASB’s compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations, but also capital adequacy, asset quality, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity and various other factors.Under certain circumstances, including any determination that ASB’s relationship with HEI results in an unsafe and unsound banking practice, these regulatory authorities have the authority to restrict the ability of ASB to transfer assets and to make distributions to its shareholders (including payment of dividends to HEI), or they could seek to require HEI to sever its relationship with or divest its ownership of ASB. Payment by ASB of dividends to HEI may also be restricted by the OCC and FRB under its prompt corrective action regulations or its capital distribution regulations if ASB’s capital position deteriorates. In order to maintain its status as a QTL, ASB is required to maintain at least 65% of its assets in “qualified thrift investments.” Institutions that fail to maintain QTL status are subject to various penalties, including limitations on their activities. In ASB’s case, the activities of HEI and HEI’s other subsidiaries would also be subject to restrictions, and a failure or inability to comply with those restrictions could effectively result in the required divestiture of ASB. Federal legislation has also been proposed in the past that could operate to eliminate the thrift charter or the grandfathered status of HEI as a unitary thrift holding company, which in turn would result in a required divestiture of ASB. In the event of a required divestiture, federal law substantially limits the types of entities that could potentially acquire ASB.Bank Regulatory Risk - Heightened regulatory requirements if ASB’s total assets exceed $10 billion.  As of December 31, 2021, ASB had total assets of approximately $9.2 billion and it is possible that total assets could exceed $10 billion in the near future. The Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations impose enhanced supervisory requirements on financial institutions with more than $10 billion in total assets. For financial institutions with more than $10 billion in total assets, such requirements include, among other things:31•Applicability of Volcker Rule requirements and restrictions;•Increased capital leverage, liquidity and risk management standards;•Examinations by the CFPB for compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations; and•Limits on interchange fees on debit cards (Durbin Amendment)The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA), which was enacted in 2018, amended the Dodd-Frank Act to raise the $10 billion stress testing threshold to $250 billion, among other things. The federal financial regulators issued final rules in 2019 to increase the threshold for these stress testing requirements from $10 billion to $250 billion, consistent with the EGRRCPA.ASB is already subject to limits for its interchange fees on debit cards as the Bank’s parent company, HEI, has total assets exceeding $10 billion and the Durbin Amendment did not exclude unitary thrift holding companies from the threshold for holding company assets subject to interchange fee limits.Federal financial regulators may require ASB to take actions to prepare for compliance with the foregoing requirements before it exceeds $10 billion in total assets. ASB’s regulators may consider its preparation for compliance with these regulatory requirements when examining the Bank’s operations or considering any request for regulatory approval. ASB may, therefore, incur compliance costs before it reaches $10 billion in total assets and may be required to maintain the additional compliance procedures even if the Bank does not grow at the anticipated rate or at all.Failure to comply with these new requirements may negatively impact the results of ASB’s operations and financial condition. To ensure compliance, the Bank may be required to invest significant resources, which may necessitate hiring additional personnel and implementing additional internal controls. These additional compliance costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Legislative Risk—Legislative and regulatory initiatives could have an adverse effect on ASB’s business.  From time to time, new legislative and other regulatory initiatives are enacted, which could have an adverse effect on ASB’s business. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July 2010, has had a substantial impact on the financial services industry. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on ASB’s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Product Concentration Risk—A large percentage of ASB’s loans and securities are collateralized by real estate, and adverse changes in the real estate market and/or general economic or other conditions may result in loan losses and adversely affect the Company’s profitability.  As of December 31, 2021 approximately 83% of ASB’s loan portfolio was comprised of loans primarily collateralized by real estate, most of which was concentrated in the State of Hawaii. During 2021, ASB’s home equity lines of credit (HELOC) decreased 13% and the residential 1-4 family portfolios increased by 7%, comprising 73% of total real estate loans. ASB’s financial results may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions, either nationally or in the state. ASB had been pursuing a strategy that included expanding its commercial, commercial real estate and consumer lines of business. Commercial and commercial real estate loans have a higher risk profile than residential loans. Though both commercial and commercial real estate loans have shorter terms and earn higher spreads than residential mortgage loans, these loan types generally entail higher underwriting and other service costs and present greater credit risks than traditional residential mortgages. Commercial loans are secured by the assets of the business and, upon default, any collateral repossessed may not be sufficient to repay the outstanding loan balance. In addition, loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and, thus, are more likely to be affected by current economic conditions and adverse business developments. Commercial real estate properties tend to be unique and are more difficult to value than residential real estate properties. Commercial real estate loans may not be fully amortizing, meaning that they have a significant principal balance or “balloon” payment due at maturity. In addition, commercial real estate properties, particularly industrial and warehouse properties, are generally subject to relatively greater environmental risks than noncommercial properties and to the corresponding burdens and costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Also, there may be costs and delays involved in enforcing rights of a property owner against tenants in default under terms of leases with respect to commercial properties. For example, a tenant may seek protection under bankruptcy laws, which could result in termination of the tenant’s lease.ASB also has a national syndicated lending portfolio where ASB is a participant in credit facilities agented by established and reputable national lenders. Management selectively chooses each deal based on conservative credit criteria to ensure a high-quality, well diversified portfolio. In the event the borrower encounters financial difficulties and ASB is unable to sell its participation interest in the loan in the secondary market, ASB is typically reliant on the originating lender for managing any loan workout or foreclosure proceedings that may become necessary. Accordingly, ASB has less control over such proceedings than loans it originates and may be required to accommodate the interests of other participating lenders in resolving 32delinquencies or defaults on participated loans, which could result in outcomes that are not fully consistent with ASB’s preferred strategies. In addition, a significant proportion of ASB’s syndicated loans are originated in states other than Hawaii and are subject to the local regional and regulatory risks specific to those states.Similar to the national syndicated lending portfolio, ASB does not service commercial loans in which it has participation interests rather than being the lead or agent lender and is subject to the policies and practices of the agent lender, who is the loan servicer, in resolving delinquencies or defaults on participated loans.The consumer loan portfolio primarily consists of personal unsecured loans with risk-based pricing. Repayment is based on the borrower’s financial stability as these loans have no collateral and there is less assurance that ASB will be able to collect all payments due under these loans or have sufficient collateral to cover all outstanding loan balances.General Risk Factors
.ESG Risk—Increased scrutiny and changing stakeholder expectations with respect to our environmental, social and governance (ESG) programs may result in increased costs and expenses and may expose the Company to new or incremental risks.  Companies across all industries, including HEI, face increasing stakeholder scrutiny related to ESG practices. These stakeholders include investors, customers, consumers, employees, lenders and other stakeholders, and in recent years, certain stakeholders have placed increasing importance on the impact and social cost of their investments. This increased focus and activism related to ESG may hinder the cost of, or access to, capital or financing as these investors or lenders may elect to increase their required returns on capital offered to the company, reallocate capital or not commit capital as a result of their assessment of a company’s ESG profile. Additionally, if the Company fails to adapt, or is perceived to have failed in addressing investor, lender, and other stakeholder ESG expectations or standards, which continue to evolve, or if the Company fails to fully and accurately report its progress on ESG initiatives, the Company may suffer reputational damage and its business or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.Human Capital Risk—HEI’s businesses may be unable to attract, hire, engage and retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce, including senior management, which could affect the Company’s execution of its growth strategy and profitability and adversely affect its future performance. The skill and experience of the Company’s employees, particularly with respect to the senior management team, are vital to the Company’s success. The management teams of HEI’s businesses have significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent, to develop and implement adequate succession plans for the senior management team, or to maintain a successful work culture that fosters collaboration, innovation, and communications could disrupt the Company’s operations and adversely affect its businesses and its future success. In addition, a variety of economic and social factors are exacerbating the current labor supply shortage, which may make it difficult to staff critical positions, retain key employees, and could result in significantly higher costs to maintain appropriate staffing levels with the right talent. The inability to fill these positions or a delay in staffing these positions could have a significant impact on the Company’s initiatives and strategies, which in turn would adversely affect the Company’s businesses and their future prospects.Inflation Risk—The Company’s costs and expenses could increase as a result of inflationary pressures and such increases may not be fully offset by an increase in revenues. A variety of economic and social factors have recently driven inflation to levels above the Federal Reserve Board’s long-term target of 2%. Long-term inflationary pressures could result in higher labor, commodities, materials and supplies, outside services and capital costs, among others, that may not fully be offset by an increase in revenues, which would adversely affect the Company’s profitability and results of operations. For example, while the Utilities’ annual revenue adjustment mechanism provides for an annual inflationary adjustment, recent months’ annualized rates of inflation have surpassed the rate of the last inflationary adjustment for the Utilities’ target revenues. To the extent the Utilities increase in actual expenses exceeds the amount provided by the last inflationary adjustment and the Utilities are unable to offset such excess with other efficiencies or cost savings, the Utilities’ profitability could be adversely impacted. Similarly, to the extent that higher labor and other costs at ASB, due to inflation or other factors, is not fully offset by an increase in non-interest income or net interest income, which is dependent on interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, earning assets growth and low-cost deposit liabilities, the Bank’s profitability and results of operations would be adversely impacted.Pension Liability Risk—HEI and Hawaiian Electric and their subsidiaries may incur higher retirement benefits expenses and have and will likely continue to be subject to substantial liabilities for retirement benefits.  Retirement benefits expenses and cash funding requirements could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the performance of the U.S. equity markets, trends in interest rates and health care costs, plan amendments, mortality improvements, new laws relating to pension funding and changes in accounting principles. For the Utilities, however, retirement benefits expenses, as adjusted by the pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions (OPEB) tracking mechanisms, have been an allowable expense for rate-making purposes.33Tax Legislation Risk—Adverse tax rulings or developments or changes in tax legislation could result in significant increases in tax payments and/or expense.  Governmental taxing authorities could challenge a tax return position taken by HEI or its subsidiaries and if the taxing authorities prevail, HEI’s consolidated tax payments and/or expense, including applicable penalties and interest, could increase significantly. Additionally, changes in tax legislation or IRS interpretations could increase the Company’s tax burden and adversely affect the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Litigation Risk—The Company could be subject to the risk of uninsured losses in excess of its accruals for litigation matters.  HEI and its subsidiaries are involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of their businesses, most of which is covered by insurance (subject to policy limits and deductibles). However, other litigation may arise that is not routine or involves claims that may not be covered by insurance. Because of the uncertainties associated with litigation, there is a risk that litigation against HEI or its subsidiaries, even if vigorously defended, could result in costs of defense and judgment or settlement amounts not covered by insurance and in excess of reserves established in HEI’s consolidated financial statements.Changes in Accounting Estimates Risk—Changes in accounting principles and estimates could affect the reported amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities or revenues and expenses.  HEI’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Changes in accounting principles (including the possible adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards or new U.S. accounting standards), or changes in the Company’s application of existing accounting principles, could materially affect the financial statement presentation of HEI’s or the Utilities’ consolidated results of operations and/or financial condition. Further, in preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the amounts reported for electric utility revenues; allowance for credit losses; income taxes; investment securities, property, plant and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; derivatives; pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; and contingencies and litigation.Changes in accounting principles can also impact HEI’s consolidated financial statements. For example, if management determines that a PPA requires the consolidation of the IPP in the financial statements, the consolidation could have a material effect on Hawaiian Electric’s and HEI’s consolidated financial statements, including the recognition of a significant amount of assets and liabilities and, if such a consolidated IPP were operating at a loss and had insufficient equity, the potential recognition of such losses"
12,HE,HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC INDS,2021-02-26,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSThe businesses of HEI and its subsidiaries involve numerous risks which, if realized, could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements. For additional information for certain risk factors enumerated below and other risks of the Company and its operations, see “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” above and HEI’s MD&A, HEI’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Hawaiian Electric’s MD&A and Hawaiian Electric’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”Holding company and company-wide risks.COVID-19—Our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations are being and could continue to be adversely impacted by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Due to the numerous country, state, city and local jurisdictions that have imposed “shelter-in-place” orders or other restrictions, including travel restrictions that directly impact the Hawaii economy, economic activity in the state has been adversely impacted. As a result of the swift economic contraction and reduction in tourism that has occurred in the state to date, the Utilities expect that demand for electricity will remain depressed and the provision for bad debt and write-offs at the Utilities will remain at an elevated level and impact liquidity as long as measures to contain the virus that severely restrict economic activity remain in place. In 2020, overall kWh sales have declined 7.1% as compared to 2019. While the Utilities expect to recover the difference between PUC approved target revenues and recorded adjusted revenues (regardless of the level of kWh sales) through the revenue balancing account under the decoupling mechanism based on estimated sales, starting on June 1st of the following year, the collection occurs on a lagged basis. If the difference to be collected, which needs to be financed in the interim, exceeds the Utilities’ current liquidity sources, there can be no assurance that the Utilities will be able to secure additional liquidity sources at a reasonable cost, or at all, or if the difference becomes so large that it would result in a significant increase in customer bills, whether the PUC will allow recovery of such difference through the revenue balancing account. In addition to lower and lagged collections, the COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in higher costs and expenses. While the Utilities have been granted deferral treatment of certain COVID-19 related costs, such as higher bad debt expense, non-collection of late payment fees, higher financing costs, sequestration costs for mission-critical employees and other costs and expenses, there can be no assurance that the PUC will grant recovery of such costs, and such costs could be material. Additionally, in light of the significant impact that economic conditions have had on residents and businesses in the state, a stipulated settlement between Hawaiian Electric and the Division of Consumer Advocacy of the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, reflecting no base rate increase, was submitted in the Hawaiian Electric 2020 test year rate case, and approved by the PUC in October 2020. While the Utilities intend to offset the no base rate increase with corresponding cost decreases, such reduction of cost is not assured and, therefore, the inability to achieve targeted cost savings could adversely affect the Utilities’ results of operations in future periods. ASB’s net interest income has also been adversely impacted by lower interest rates across the curve, which are influenced by economic conditions. Accordingly, an extended economic slowdown could have a significant continuing impact on its net interest income. In addition, an extended economic slowdown may also affect the ability of borrowers to make payments on their loans, which would have an adverse impact on ASB’s provision for credit losses. While the Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to operate through this crisis, there can be no assurance that sufficient liquidity will be available if the slowdown in economic activity continues for an extended period of time. The Company is closely monitoring the situation and taking appropriate actions to operate its businesses and protect its workforce while serving customers and the community. The slowdown in economic activity to date has had a significant adverse effect on the Company’s financial performance. If the slowdown in economic activity continues for an extended period of time, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company. These effects could include, but are not limited to:•Disruptions or restrictions on employees’ ability to work effectively due to illness, travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders or other limitations.•The inability of customers, IPPs, contractors, suppliers, creditors and other business partners to fulfill their obligations. For example, several IPPs have declared force majeure as a protective measure, citing the pandemic, which could potentially result in significant project delays. •Disruption and volatility in the global credit and financial markets, which may increase the cost of capital and could adversely impact access to capital for the Company and its customers and suppliers.18•Further deterioration in economic conditions, or an extension of slow economic activity, which negatively impacts the Company’s earnings and liquidity, could also result in an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or long-lived assets. •Actions taken or may be taken, or decisions made or may be made by the Company, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in legal claims or litigation against the Company.Due to the unprecedented nature of the pandemic and the significant uncertainty it creates, including the unknown severity and duration of the pandemic and the resulting impact it may have on Hawaii businesses and residents of the state, which could also be affected by the pace of distribution, administration, and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine, as well as the proportion of the population vaccinated, the Company is unable to predict the full extent of the future impact on the Company’s businesses at this time, and those impacts could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.Holding Company Risk—HEI is a holding company that derives its income from its operating subsidiaries and depends on the ability of those subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI and on its own ability to raise capital.  HEI is a legal entity separate and distinct from its various subsidiaries. As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, HEI’s cash flows and consequent ability to service its obligations and pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon its receipt of dividends or other distributions from its operating subsidiaries and its ability to issue common stock or other equity securities and to incur additional debt. The ability of HEI’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI, in turn, is subject to the risks associated with their operations and to contractual and regulatory restrictions, including:•the provisions of an HEI agreement with the PUC, which could limit the ability of HEI’s principal electric public utility subsidiary, Hawaiian Electric, to pay dividends to HEI in the event that the consolidated common stock equity of the Utilities falls below 35% of total capitalization of the electric utilities;•the provisions of an HEI agreement entered into with federal bank regulators in connection with its acquisition of its bank subsidiary, ASB, which requires HEI to contribute additional capital to ASB (up to a maximum amount of additional capital of $28.3 million as of December 31, 2020 under the Regulatory Capital Maintenance/Dividend Agreement dated May 26, 1988, between HEI, HEIDI (HEI Diversified Inc.) and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation) upon request of the regulators in order to maintain ASB’s regulatory capital at the level required by regulation;•the minimum capital and capital distribution regulations of the OCC that are applicable to ASB and capital regulations that become applicable to HEI and ASB Hawaii;•the receipt of a letter from the FRB communicating the OCC’s and the FRB’s non-objection to the payment of any dividend ASB proposes to declare and pay to ASB Hawaii and HEI; and•the provisions of preferred stock resolutions and debt instruments of HEI and its subsidiaries.Credit and Capital Market Risk—The Company, and its credit rating, is subject to risks associated with the Hawaii economy (in the aggregate and on an individual island basis), volatile U.S. capital markets and changes in the interest rate and credit market environment that have or could result in higher retirement benefit plan funding requirements, declines in ASB’s interest rate margins and investment values, higher delinquencies and charge-offs in ASB’s loan portfolio and restrictions on the ability of HEI or its subsidiaries to borrow money or issue securities.  The two largest components of Hawaii’s economy are tourism and the federal government (including the military). Because the core businesses of HEI’s subsidiaries are providing local public electric utility services (through Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries) and banking services (through ASB) in Hawaii, the Company’s operating results are significantly influenced by: Hawaii’s economy, which in turn is influenced by economic conditions in the mainland U.S. (particularly California) and Asia (particularly Japan) as a result of the impact of those conditions on tourism; by the impact of interest rates on the construction and real estate industries and by the impact of federal government spending in Hawaii, which can be affected by world conditions; and, from time to time, the expiration of federal government appropriations bills. In addition, the Hawaii economy could be directly or indirectly affected by implications and potential impacts of U.S. and foreign capital and credit market conditions and federal, state and international responses to those conditions and the potential impacts of global and local developments (including economic conditions and uncertainties; unrest, terrorist acts, wars, conflicts, political protests, deadly virus epidemic, pandemics, or other crisis; the effects of changes that have or may occur in U.S. policy, such as with respect to immigration and trade).    HEI’s and Hawaiian Electric’s securities ratings only reflect the view, at the time the ratings are issued, of the applicable rating agency. There is no assurance that any such credit rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such rating will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agency if, in such rating agency’s judgment, circumstances, such as current, past or future effects or events so warrant. Any such lowering, suspension or withdrawal of any rating may have an adverse effect on the availability of capital to the Company or the market price or marketability of HEI’s and/or Hawaiian Electric’s securities, which could increase the cost of capital of HEI and Hawaiian Electric, and such increased costs, including interest charges, under HEI’s and/or Hawaiian Electric’s debt securities and credit facilities, would result in reductions in HEI’s consolidated net income in future periods. Further, if HEI’s or Hawaiian Electric’s 19commercial paper ratings were to be downgraded, HEI and Hawaiian Electric might not be able to sell commercial paper and might be required to draw on more expensive bank lines of credit or to defer capital or other expenditures. Neither HEI nor Hawaiian Electric management can predict future rating agency actions or their effects on the future cost of capital of HEI or Hawaiian Electric. Such ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold any securities; such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies; and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.Changes in the U.S. capital markets can also have significant effects on the Company. For example, pension funding requirements are affected by the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for pension plans, and by the discount rate used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost and value obligations. The Utilities’ pension tracking mechanisms help moderate pension expense; however, a significant reduction in the discount rate or in the value of the Company’s defined benefit pension plan assets could result in a substantial increase in the gap between the projected benefit obligations under the plans and the value of plan assets, resulting in increases in funding requirements.Because the earnings of ASB depend primarily on net interest income, interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASB’s operations. HEI and the Utilities are also exposed to interest rate risk primarily due to their periodic borrowing requirements, the discount rate used to determine pension funding requirements and the possible effect of interest rates on the electric utilities’ rates of return. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors, including general economic conditions and the policies of government and regulatory authorities. HEI cannot predict future changes in interest rates, nor be certain that interest rate risk management strategies it or its subsidiaries have implemented will be successful in managing interest rate risk.Interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting the fair value of ASB’s investment securities. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair values of those instruments, respectively. Disruptions in the credit markets, a liquidity crisis in the banking industry or increased levels of residential mortgage delinquencies and defaults may result in decreases in the fair value of ASB’s investment securities and an impairment, requiring ASB to write down its investment securities. As of December 31, 2020, ASB’s investment in U.S. Treasury, federal agency obligations, and mortgage-backed securities have an implicit guarantee from the U.S. government.Geographic Concentration Risk—The Company is subject to the risks associated with the geographic concentration of its businesses and current lack of interconnections that could result in service interruptions at the Utilities or higher default rates on loans held by ASB.  The business of the Utilities is concentrated on the individual islands they serve in the State of Hawaii. Their operations are more vulnerable to service interruptions than are many U.S. mainland utilities because none of the systems of the Utilities are interconnected with the systems on the other islands they serve. Because of this lack of interconnections, it is necessary to maintain higher generation reserve margins than are typical for U.S. mainland utilities to help ensure reliable service. Service interruptions, including in particular extended interruptions that could result from a natural disaster or terrorist activity, could adversely impact the revenues and costs of some or all of the Utilities.Substantially all of ASB’s consumer loan customers are Hawaii residents. A significant portion of the commercial loan customers are also located in Hawaii. While a majority of customers are on Oahu, ASB also has customers on the neighbor islands (whose economies have been weaker than Oahu’s economy during the last economic downturn). Substantially all of the real estate underlying ASB’s residential and commercial real estate loans are located in Hawaii. These assets may be subject to a greater risk of default than other comparable assets held by financial institutions with other geographic concentrations in the event of adverse economic, political or business developments or natural disasters affecting Hawaii and affect the ability of ASB’s customers to make payments of principal and interest on their loans.Competitive and Technological Risk—Increasing competition and technological advances could cause HEI’s businesses to lose customers or render their operations obsolete.  The banking industry in Hawaii, and certain aspects of the electric utility industry, are competitive. The success of HEI’s subsidiaries in meeting competition and responding to technological advances will continue to have a direct impact on HEI’s consolidated financial performance. For example:•ASB, one of the largest financial institutions in the state, is in direct competition for deposits and loans not only with two larger institutions that have substantial capital, technology and marketing resources, but also with smaller Hawaii institutions and other U.S. institutions, including credit unions, mutual funds, mortgage brokers, finance companies and investment banking firms. Larger financial institutions may have greater access to capital at lower costs, which could impair ASB’s ability to compete effectively. New or significant advances in technology (e.g., significant advances in internet or mobile banking) could render the operations of ASB less competitive or obsolete. •The Utilities face competition from IPPs; customer self-generation, with or without cogeneration; customer energy storage; and the potential formation of community-based, cooperative ownership or municipality structures for electrical service on all islands it serves. With the exception of certain identified projects, the Utilities are required to use competitive bidding to acquire a future generation resource unless the PUC finds competitive bidding to be 20unsuitable. The PUC sets policies for distributed generation interconnection agreements and standby rates. The results of competitive bidding, competition from IPPs, customer self-generation, and potential cooperative ownership or municipality structures for electric utility service, and the rate at which technological developments facilitating nonutility generation of electricity, combined heat and power technology, off-grid microgrids, and customer energy storage may render the operations of the Utilities less competitive or outdated and adversely affect the Utilities and the results of their operations. Cybersecurity Risk—The Company may be subject to information technology and operational system failures, network disruptions, cyber attacks and breaches in data security that could adversely affect its businesses and reputation. The Company and its subsidiaries rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed or hosted by third party service providers, to manage its business data, communications, and other business processes. Such information technology systems may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or other security incidents, which could result in unauthorized access to confidential data or disruptions to operations. In addition, there is increasing cybersecurity risk associated with the broad adoption of a remote working environment as a result of the pandemic. If the Company is unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve an incident, it may have a material impact on the Company’s operations or business reputation.Utilities.  The Utilities rely on evolving and increasingly complex operational and information systems, networks and other technologies, which are interconnected with the systems and network infrastructure owned by third parties to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, invoicing and collection of payments, customer relationship management, human resource management, the acquisition, generation and delivery of electrical service to customers, and to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting and legal and tax requirements. The Utilities use their systems and infrastructure to create, collect, store, and process sensitive information, including personal information regarding customers, employees and their dependents, retirees, and other individuals. Despite the Utilities security measures, all of their systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access caused by natural disasters, cybersecurity incidents, security breaches, user error, unintentional defects created by system changes, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures or similar events. Any such failure could have a material adverse impact on the Utilities’ ability to process transactions and provide service, as well the Utilities’ financial condition and results of operations. Further, a data breach involving theft, improper disclosure, or other unauthorized access to or acquisition of confidential information could subject the Utilities to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, claims by third parties, and enforcement actions by government agencies. A data breach could also reduce the value of proprietary information, and harm the reputation of the Utilities.As noted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the utility industry is continuing to experience an increase in the frequency and sophistication of cybersecurity incidents. The Utilities’ systems have been, and will likely continue to be, a target of attacks. Further, the Utilities’ operational networks may be subject to new cybersecurity risks due to modernizing and interconnecting existing infrastructure with new technologies and control systems, including those owned by third parties.  Although the Utilities have not experienced a material cybersecurity breach to date, such incidents may occur and may have a material adverse effect on the Utilities and the Company in the future. In order to address cybersecurity risks to their information systems, the Utilities maintain security measures designed to protect their information technology systems, network infrastructure and other assets. The Utilities actively monitor developments in the area of cybersecurity and are involved in various related government and industry groups, and brief the Company’s Board quarterly on relevant cybersecurity issues. Although the Utilities continue to make investments in their cybersecurity program, including personnel, technologies, cyber insurance and training of Utilities personnel, there can be no assurance that these systems or their expected functionality will be implemented, maintained, or expanded effectively; nor can security measures completely eliminate the possibility of a cybersecurity breach. The Utility maintains cyber liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents. However, there is no guarantee that adequate insurance will continue to be available at rates the Utility believes are reasonable or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates. If the Utilities’ cybersecurity measures were to be breached, the Utilities could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to their reputation.Due to the size, scope and complexity of the Utilities’ business, the development and maintenance of information technology systems to process and track information is critical and challenging. The Utilities often rely on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems and these third-party vendors could cease to exist, fail to establish adequate processes to protect the Utilities systems and information, experience supply chain compromises or other internal or external security incidents. In addition, the Utilities are pursuing complex business transformation initiatives, which include the implementation of new systems and the upgrade or replacement of existing systems. Significant system changes increase the risk of system interruptions. Although the Utilities maintain change control processes to mitigate this risk, system interruptions may occur. Further, delay or failure to complete the integration of information systems and processes may result in delays in regulatory cost recovery, or the failure to realize the benefits anticipated to be derived from these initiatives.21The Utilities have disaster recovery plans in place to protect their businesses from information technology service interruptions. The disaster recovery plans, however, may not be successful in preventing the loss of customer data, service interruptions and disruptions to operations or damage to important facilities. If any of these systems fail to operate properly or becomes disabled and the Utilities’ disaster recovery plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, the Utilities could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to their reputations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities’ and the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.ASB.  ASB is highly dependent on its ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions and relies heavily on communication and information systems, including those of third-party vendors and other service providers. Communication and information system failures can result from a variety of risks including, but not limited to, events that are wholly or partially out of ASB’s control, such as communication line integrity, weather, terrorist acts, natural disasters, accidental disasters, unauthorized breaches of security systems, energy delivery systems, cyberattacks and other events.ASB is under continuous threat of loss due to cyberattacks, especially as ASB continues to expand customer capabilities to utilize the Internet and other remote channels to transact business. Two of the most significant cyberattack risks that ASB faces are e-fraud and loss of sensitive customer data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals extract funds directly from customers’ or ASB’s accounts using fraudulent schemes that may include Internet-based funds transfers. ASB has been subject to e-fraud incidents historically. Loss of sensitive customer data are attempts to steal sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, through unauthorized access to computer systems, including computer hacking. Such attacks are less frequent, but could present significant reputational, legal and regulatory costs if successful. Intrusion detection and prevention systems, anti-virus software, firewalls and other general information technology controls have been put in place to detect and prevent cyberattacks or information system breaches. A disaster recovery plan has been developed in the event of a natural disaster, security breach, military or terrorist action, power or communication failure or similar event. The disaster recovery plan, however, may not be successful in preventing the loss of customer data, service interruptions, disruptions to operations or damage to important facilities. Although ASB devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of ASB’s computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to ASB and its customers, there can be no assurance that such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately corrected by ASB or its vendors.If any of these systems fail to operate properly or become disabled even for a brief period of time, ASB could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to its reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on ASB’s and the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. Uninsured Losses—HEI’s businesses could suffer losses that are uninsured due to a lack of affordable insurance coverage, unavailability of insurance coverage or limitations on the insurance coverage the Company does have.  In the ordinary course of business, HEI and its subsidiaries purchase insurance coverages (e.g., property and liability coverages) to protect against loss of, or damage to, their properties and against claims made by third parties and employees for property damage or personal injuries. However, the protection provided by such insurance is limited in significant respects and, in some instances, there is no coverage. Some of the insurance coverages have substantial deductibles or has limits on the maximum amounts that may be recovered. In common with other companies in its line of business, the Utilities’ overhead and underground transmission and distribution systems (with the exception of substation buildings and contents), which have a replacement value roughly estimated at $8 billion, are largely not insured against loss or damage because the amount of transmission and distribution system insurance capacity is limited and the premiums are cost prohibitive. Similarly, the Utilities have no business interruption insurance as the premiums for such insurance would be cost prohibitive, particularly since the Utilities are not interconnected to other systems. If a hurricane or other uninsured catastrophic natural disaster were to occur, and if the PUC did not allow the affected Utilities to recover from ratepayers restoration costs and revenues lost from business interruption, the lost revenues and repair expenses could result in a significant decrease in HEI’s consolidated net income or in significant net losses for the affected periods.ASB generally does not obtain credit enhancements, such as mortgagor bankruptcy insurance, but does require standard hazard and hurricane insurance and may require flood insurance for certain properties. ASB is subject to the risks of borrower defaults and bankruptcies, special hazard losses not covered by the required insurance and the insurance company’s inability to pay claims on existing policies.Environmental Regulation—Increased federal and state environmental regulation will require an increasing commitment of resources and funds and could result in construction delays or penalties and fines for non-compliance. HEI and its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, hazardous substances, waste management, natural resources and health and safety, which regulate, among other matters, the operation of existing facilities, the construction and operation of new facilities and the proper cleanup and disposal of hazardous 22and toxic wastes and substances. These laws and regulations could result in increased capital, operating, and other costs. HEI or its subsidiaries are currently involved in investigatory or remedial actions at current, former or third-party sites and there is no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs relating to these sites. In addition, compliance with these legal requirements requires the Utilities to commit significant resources and funds toward, among other things, environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment and payment of emission fees. These laws and regulations, among other things, require that certain environmental permits be obtained in order to construct or operate certain facilities, and obtaining such permits can entail significant expense and cause substantial construction delays. Also, these laws and regulations may be amended from time to time, including amendments that increase the burden and cost of compliance. For example, emission and/or discharge limits may be tightened, more extensive permitting requirements may be imposed and additional substances may become regulated. In addition, significant regulatory uncertainty exists regarding the impact of federal or state greenhouse gas emission limits and reductions.If HEI or its subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond their control, that failure may result in civil or criminal penalties and fines or the cessation of operations that could have a material adverse on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Electric utility risks.    The following risks are generally specific to Hawaiian Electric, but could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Regulatory Risk—Actions of the PUC are outside the control of the Utilities and could result in inadequate or untimely rate increases, in rate reductions or refunds or in unanticipated delays, expenses or writedowns in connection with the construction of new projects.  The rates the Utilities are allowed to charge for their services and the timeliness of permitted rate increases are among the most important items influencing the Utilities’ results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The PUC has broad discretion over the rates that the Utilities charge their customers. On December 23, 2020, as part of the D&O establishing a new PBR Framework, there will be a five-year Multi-year Rate Period (MRP) during which there will be no general rate cases. In the fourth year of the MRP, the PUC will comprehensively review the PBR Framework to determine if any modifications or revisions are appropriate. Any adverse decision by the PUC concerning the level or method of determining electric utility rates at the end of the multi-year rate period including the items and amounts that may be included in rate base, the returns on equity or rate base found to be reasonable, the potential consequences of exceeding or not meeting such returns, the denial of exception project recovery applications during the multi-year rate period, adverse impact of adjustments made to the PBR Framework, decisions on recovery of exogenous items, under the PBR Framework, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding could have a material adverse effect on Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.To improve the timing and certainty of the recovery of their costs, the Utilities have proposed and/or received approval of various cost recovery mechanisms, including an ECRC (changed from ECAC in 2019, now also includes a PUC-ordered risk-sharing split between ratepayers and the Utilities for fossil fuel price variations from baseline prices, with a current annual aggregate exposure cap of +/- $3.7 million), a PPAC, and pension and OPEB tracking mechanisms, as well as a decoupling mechanism, an exceptional project recovery mechanism (EPRM), formerly major project interim recovery (MPIR) adjustment mechanism, and a Renewable Energy Infrastructure Program (REIP) surcharge. A change in, or the elimination of, any of these cost recovery mechanisms, could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities. See “Regulatory mechanisms” in Electric Utility’s Business.Under the new PBR Framework, the Utilities’ the annual revenue adjustment (ARA) includes a customer dividend consisting of a negative adjustment of 0.22% compounded annually and a flow through of the “pre-PBR” savings commitment from the management audit recommendations developed in the 2020 test year rate case.  Not achieving the cost savings commitment could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities. Under the new PBR Framework, the existing PIMs continue, and the PUC established new PIMs.  Not meeting the PIMs that have penalties for not achieving performance incentive goals could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities.  Based on the current operations of the Utilities and regulatory framework, including the impact of the newly approved PBR Framework, the Utilities continue to follow regulatory accounting under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 980. Continued accounting in this manner requires that certain criteria relating to the recoverability of such costs through rates be met, including achieved financial results that support the recovery of costs. If events or circumstances should change, such that the criteria are no longer satisfied, the Utilities expect that their regulatory assets (amounting to $767 million as of December 31, 2020), net of regulatory liabilities (amounting to $960 million as of December 31, 2020), would be charged to the 23statement of income in the period of discontinuance. See “Performance-based regulation framework” in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.The Utilities could be required to refund to their customers, with interest, revenues that have been or may be received under interim rate orders in their rate case proceedings and other proceedings, if and to the extent they exceed the amounts allowed in final orders.Many public utility projects require PUC approval and various permits (e.g., environmental and land use permits) from other governmental agencies. Difficulties in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, the necessary approvals or permits, or any adverse decision or policy made or adopted, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision, by an agency with respect to such approvals and permits, can result in significantly increased project costs or even cancellation of projects. In the event a project does not proceed, or if the PUC disallows cost recovery for all or part of a project, or if project costs exceed caps imposed by the PUC in its approval of the project, project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could result in significant reductions in Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated net income. Weather Conditions Risk—Electric utility operations are significantly influenced by weather conditions.  The Utilities’ results of operations can be affected by the weather and natural disasters. Weather conditions, particularly temperature and humidity, directly influence the demand for electricity. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, lava flows and lightning storms, some of which may become more severe or frequent as a result of global climate changes, can cause outages and property damage and require the Utilities to incur significant additional expenses that may not be recoverable.Climate Change Risk—Electric utility operations may be significantly influenced by climate change.  While the timing, extent and ultimate effects of climate change cannot be determined with any certainty, climate change is predicted to result in sea level rise, which could potentially impact coastal and other low-lying areas (where much of the Utilities’ electric infrastructure is sited), and could cause erosion of beaches, saltwater intrusion into aquifers and surface ecosystems, higher water tables and increased flooding and storm damage due to heavy rainfall. The effects of climate change on the weather (for example, floods, hurricanes, heat waves or drought conditions, the latter of which could increase wildfire risk), sea levels, and water availability and quality, all have the potential to materially adversely affect the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities. For example, severe weather and its related impacts could cause significant harm to the Utilities’ physical facilities. Third Party Performance Risk—Electric utility operations depend heavily on third-party suppliers of fuel and purchased power.  The Utilities rely on fuel suppliers and shippers, and IPPs to deliver fuel and power, respectively, in accordance with contractual agreements. Approximately 69% of the net energy generated or purchased by the Utilities in 2020 was generated from the burning of fossil fuel oil, and purchases of power by the Utilities provided about 46% of their total net energy generated and purchased for the same period. Failure or delay by fuel suppliers and shippers to provide fuel pursuant to existing contracts, or failure by a major IPP to deliver the firm capacity anticipated in its PPA, could disrupt the ability of the Utilities to deliver electricity and require the Utilities to incur additional expenses to meet the needs of their customers that may not be recoverable. In addition, as the IPP contracts near the end of their terms, there may be less economic incentive for the IPPs to make investments in their units to ensure the availability of their units. Also, as these contractual agreements end, the Utilities may not be able to purchase fuel and power on terms equivalent to the current contractual agreements.Capacity Risk—The capacity provided by the Utilities’ generating resources and third-party purchased power may not be sufficient to meet customers’ energy requirements.  The Utilities rely upon their generating resources and purchased power from third parties to meet their customers’ energy requirements. The Utilities update their generation capacity evaluation each year to determine the Utilities’ ability to meet reasonably expected demands for service and provide reasonable reserves for emergencies. These evaluations are impacted by a variety of factors, including customer energy demand, energy conservation and efficiency initiatives, economic conditions, and weather patterns. If the capacity provided by the Utilities’ generating resources and third-party purchased power is not adequate relative to customer demand, the Utilities may have to contract to buy more power from third parties, invest in additional generating facilities over the long-term, or extend the operating life of existing utility units. Any failure to meet customer energy requirements could negatively impact the satisfaction of the Utilities’ customers, which could have an adverse impact on the Utilities’ business and results of operations. Stakeholder Activism Risk—Electric utility and third-party purchased power projects may be significantly impacted by stakeholder activism.  The potential impact of stakeholder activism could increase total utility project costs, and delay the permitting, construction and overall timing or preclude the completion of third-party or utility projects that are required to meet electricity demand, resilience and reliability objectives, and RPS goals. If a utility project cannot be completed, the project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could result in significant reductions in Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated net income. 24Operational Risk—Electric utility generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated and/or increased operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs.  Operation of electric generating facilities involves certain risks which can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels. Included among these risks are facility shutdowns or power interruptions due to insufficient generation or a breakdown or failure of equipment or processes. In addition, operations could be negatively impacted by interruptions in fuel supply, inability to negotiate satisfactory collective bargaining agreements when existing agreements expire or other labor disputes, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements, disruptions in delivery of electricity, operator error and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, fires, explosions, lava flows, floods or other similar occurrences affecting the Utilities’ generating facilities or transmission and distribution systems.Legislative Risk—The Utilities may be adversely affected by new legislation or administrative actions.  Congress, the Hawaii legislature and governmental agencies periodically consider legislation and other initiatives that could have uncertain or negative effects on the Utilities and their customers. Congress, the Hawaii legislature and governmental agencies have adopted, or are considering adopting, a number of measures that will significantly affect the Utilities, as described below.Renewable Portfolio Standards law.  In 2015, Hawaii’s RPS law was amended to require electric utilities to meet an RPS of 15%, 30%, 40%, 70% and 100% by December 31, 2015, 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2045 respectively. Energy savings resulting from energy efficiency programs do not count toward the RPS after 2014. The Utilities are committed to achieving these goals and met the 2015 and 2020 RPS; however, due to the exclusion of energy savings in calculating RPS after 2014 and risks such as potential delays in IPPs being able to deliver contracted renewable energy, it is possible the Utilities may not attain the required renewable percentages in the future, and management cannot predict the future consequences of failure to do so (including potential penalties to be assessed by the PUC). On December 19, 2008, the PUC approved a penalty of $20 for every MWh that an electric utility is deficient under Hawaii’s RPS law. The PUC noted, however, that this penalty may be reduced, in the PUC’s discretion, due to events or circumstances that are outside an electric utility’s reasonable control, to the extent the event or circumstance could not be reasonably foreseen and ameliorated, as described in the RPS law and in an RPS framework adopted by the PUC. In addition, the PUC ordered that the Utilities will be prohibited from recovering any RPS penalty costs through rates.Renewable energy.  In 2007, a measure was passed by the Hawaii legislature stating that the PUC may consider the need for increased renewable energy in rendering decisions on utility matters. Due to this measure, it is possible that, if energy from a renewable source is more expensive than energy from fossil fuel, the PUC may still approve the purchase of energy from the renewable source, resulting in higher costs.Global climate change and greenhouse gas emissions reduction.  National and international concern about climate change and the contribution of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (including carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels) to climate change have led to federal legislative and regulatory proposals and action by the state of Hawaii to reduce GHG emissions. In July 2007, the State Legislature passed Act 234, which requires a statewide reduction of GHG emissions by January 1, 2020 to levels at or below the statewide GHG emission levels in 1990. On June 20, 2014, the Governor signed the final rules required to implement Act 234 and these rules went into effect on June 30, 2014. In general, Act 234 and the GHG rule require affected sources that have the potential to emit GHGs in excess of established thresholds to reduce their GHG emissions by 16% below 2010 emission levels by 2020. In accordance with State requirements, the Utilities submitted an Emissions Reduction Plan (ERP) to the DOH on June 30, 2015, with the most recent revision filed on June 9, 2020, to reflect the partnership established between the Utilities and several IPPs. In this plan, the partnership has committed to a 16% reduction in GHG emissions in accordance with the rule. The DOH issued the air permits incorporating the ERP including provisions to address the period of unavailability of the PGV facility on Hawaii Island. It is expected that with the advent of additional renewable projects and the application to the PUC with respect to the expansion of the PPA for the PGV project, the goals should be attainable. Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Section 269-6(b) requires that “in making determinations of the reasonableness of the costs of utility system capital improvements and operations, the PUC shall explicitly consider, quantitatively or qualitatively, the effect of the State’s reliance on fossil fuels on price volatility, export of funds for fuel imports, fuel supply reliability risk, and greenhouse gas emissions.” Based on HRS Section 269-6(b) and recent case law discussing the scope of this section, the Utilities are performing GHG analyses to quantitatively or qualitatively describe the GHG emissions of proposed projects that are submitted to the PUC for approval.In June 2018, House Bill 2182 was signed into law as Act 15 and took effect on July 1, 2018. Among its provisions, Act 15 aligned the State’s clean energy and carbon sequestration efforts with climate initiative goals and established a statewide carbon neutral goal by 2045. Under this Act, efforts would be made to “sequester more atmospheric carbon and greenhouse gases than emitted within the State as quickly as practicable, but no later than 2045.” The Hawaii Climate Change Mitigation and 25Adaptation Commission, administratively placed under the State Department of Land and Natural Resources, was charged with endeavoring to achieve the target, and giving consideration to the impact of its plans, decisions and strategies on the State’s ability to attain the goal. The general functions, duties and powers of the Hawaii Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission are set forth in HRS Section 225P-3. To achieve its mandates, the Hawaii Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission may recommend plans, decisions and strategies that could have an impact on various entities including the Utilities. The Utilities have taken, and continue to identify opportunities to take, direct action to reduce GHG emissions from their operations, including, but not limited to, supporting demand-side management programs that foster energy efficiency, using renewable resources for energy production and purchasing power from IPPs generated by renewable resources, and burning renewable biodiesel at selected Hawaiian Electric and Maui Electric generating units. The foregoing legislation or legislation that now is, or may in the future be, proposed present risks and uncertainties for the Utilities.Renewable Transition Risk—The Utilities may be subject to increased operational challenges and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely impacted in meeting the commitments and objectives of clean energy initiatives and Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS).  The far-reaching nature of the Utilities’ renewable energy commitments and the RPS goals present risks to the Company. Among such risks are: (1) the dependence on third-party suppliers of renewable purchased energy, which if the Utilities are unsuccessful in negotiating purchased power agreements with such IPPs or if a major IPP fails to deliver the anticipated capacity and/or energy in its purchased power agreement, could impact the Utilities’ achievement of their commitments to RPS goals and/or the Utilities’ ability to deliver reliable service; (2) delays in acquiring or unavailability of non-fossil fuel supplies for renewable generation; (3) the impact of intermittent power to the electrical grid and reliability of service if appropriate supporting infrastructure is not installed or does not operate effectively; (4) the likelihood that the Utilities may need to make substantial investments in related infrastructure, which could result in increased borrowings and, therefore, materially impact the financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities; (5) the imputed debt related to the pending renewable power purchase agreements under the stage 1 and stage 2 RFPs could result in a credit rating downgrade for the Utilities and the Company; and (6) the commitment to support a variety of initiatives, which, if approved by the PUC, may have a material impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the Utilities depending on their design and implementation. These initiatives include, but are not limited to, programs to enable more customer-sited generation. The implementation of these or other programs may adversely impact the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities.Bank risks.The following risks are generally specific to ASB, but could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Interest Rate Risk—Fluctuations in interest rates could result in lower net interest income, impair ASB’s ability to originate new loans or impair the ability of ASB’s adjustable-rate borrowers to make increased payments or cause such borrowers to repay their adjustable-rate loans.  Interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASB’s operations. ASB’s net interest income consists primarily of interest income received on fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, mortgage-backed securities and investments, less interest expense consisting primarily of interest paid on deposits and other borrowings. Interest rate risk arises when earning assets mature or when their interest rates change in a time frame different from that of the costing liabilities. Changes in market interest rates, including changes in the relationship between short-term and long-term market interest rates (e.g., a flat or an inverted yield curve) or between different interest rate indices, and the duration and severity of the changes in market interest rates can impact ASB’s net interest margin. See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.” Although ASB pursues an asset-liability management strategy designed to mitigate its risk from changes in market interest rates, unfavorable movements in interest rates could result in lower net interest income. Residential 1-4 family fixed-rate mortgage loans comprised about 37% of ASB’s loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and do not re-price with movements in interest rates. ASB continues to face a challenging interest rate environment. Increases in market interest rates could have an adverse impact on ASB’s cost of funds. Higher market interest rates could lead to higher interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Significant increases in market interest rates, or the perception that an increase may occur, could adversely affect ASB’s ability to originate new loans and grow. An increase in market interest rates, especially a sudden increase, could also adversely affect the ability of ASB’s adjustable-rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations. If this occurred, it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets and charge-offs. Conversely, a decrease in interest rates or a mismatching of maturities of interest sensitive financial instruments could result in an acceleration in the prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities and impact ASB’s ability to reinvest its liquidity in similar yielding assets.26LIBOR Sunset Transition Risk—Changes in the method for determining London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the potential replacement of LIBOR may affect our loan portfolio and interest income on loans. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee composed of large U.S. financial institutions, announced replacement of U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by U.S. Treasury securities called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The potential effect of the elimination of LIBOR on ASB’s LIBOR-indexed loan portfolio and interest income on loans cannot yet be determined.Credit Risk—ASB’s allowance for credit losses may not cover actual loan losses. ASB’s allowance for credit losses is ASB’s estimate of lifetime expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit and is based on a continuing assessment of:•existing risks in the loan portfolio;•historical loss experience with ASB’s loans;•changes in collateral value; •current conditions (for example, economic conditions, real estate market conditions and interest rate environment) and;•reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount.If ASB’s actual loan losses exceed its allowance for credit losses, it may incur losses, its financial condition may be materially and adversely affected, and additional capital may be required to enhance its capital position. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, regularly review the adequacy of ASB’s allowance. These agencies may require ASB to establish additional allowances based on their judgment of the information available at the time of their examinations. No assurance can be given that ASB will not sustain loan losses in excess of present or future levels of its allowance for credit losses.Operational Risk—ASB’s operations are affected by factors that are beyond its control, that could result in lower revenues, higher expenses or decreased demand for its products and services.  ASB’s results of operations depend primarily on the income generated by the supply of, and demand for, its products and services, which primarily consist of loans and deposit services. ASB’s revenues and expenses may be adversely affected by various factors, including:•local, regional, national and other economic and political conditions that could result in declines in employment and real estate values, which in turn could adversely affect the ability of borrowers to make loan payments and the ability of ASB to recover the full amounts owing to it under defaulted loans;•the ability of borrowers to obtain insurance and the ability of ASB to place insurance where borrowers fail to do so, particularly in the event of catastrophic damage to collateral securing loans made by ASB;•faster than expected loan prepayments that can cause an acceleration of the amortization of premiums on loans and investments and the impairment of mortgage servicing assets of ASB;•changes in ASB’s loan portfolio credit profiles and asset quality, which may increase or decrease the required level of allowance for credit losses;•technological disruptions affecting ASB’s operations or financial or operational difficulties experienced by any outside vendor on whom ASB relies to provide key components of its business operations, such as business processing, network access or internet connections;•events of default and foreclosure of loans whereby ASB becomes the owner of mortgage properties that presents environmental risk or potential clean up liability;•the impact of legislative and regulatory changes, including changes affecting capital requirements, increasing oversight of and reporting by banks, or affecting the lending programs or other business activities of ASB;•additional legislative changes regulating the assessment of overdraft, interchange and credit card fees, which can have a negative impact on noninterest income;•public opinion about ASB and financial institutions in general, which, if negative, could impact the public’s trust and confidence in ASB and adversely affect ASB’s ability to attract and retain customers and expose ASB to adverse legal and regulatory consequences;•increases in operating costs (including employee compensation expense and benefits and regulatory compliance costs), inflation and other factors, that exceed increases in ASB’s net interest, fee and other income; and•the ability of ASB to maintain or increase the level of deposits, ASB’s lowest costing funds.Banking Regulatory Risk—Banking and related regulations could result in significant restrictions being imposed on ASB’s business or in a requirement that HEI divest ASB.  ASB is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the Department of Treasury, the OCC and the FDIC, and is subject to reserve requirements established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In addition, the FRB is responsible for regulating ASB’s holding companies, HEI and ASB Hawaii. The regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and 27examination policies to address not only ASB’s compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations, but also capital adequacy, asset quality, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity and various other factors.Under certain circumstances, including any determination that ASB’s relationship with HEI results in an unsafe and unsound banking practice, these regulatory authorities have the authority to restrict the ability of ASB to transfer assets and to make distributions to its shareholders (including payment of dividends to HEI), or they could seek to require HEI to sever its relationship with or divest its ownership of ASB. Payment by ASB of dividends to HEI may also be restricted by the OCC and FRB under its prompt corrective action regulations or its capital distribution regulations if ASB’s capital position deteriorates. In order to maintain its status as a QTL, ASB is required to maintain at least 65% of its assets in “qualified thrift investments.” Institutions that fail to maintain QTL status are subject to various penalties, including limitations on their activities. In ASB’s case, the activities of HEI and HEI’s other subsidiaries would also be subject to restrictions, and a failure or inability to comply with those restrictions could effectively result in the required divestiture of ASB. Federal legislation has also been proposed in the past that could operate to eliminate the thrift charter or the grandfathered status of HEI as a unitary thrift holding company, which in turn would result in a required divestiture of ASB. In the event of a required divestiture, federal law substantially limits the types of entities that could potentially acquire ASB.Legislative Risk—Legislative and regulatory initiatives could have an adverse effect on ASB’s business.  From time to time, new legislative and other regulatory initiatives are enacted, which could have an adverse effect on ASB’s business. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July 2010, has had a substantial impact on the financial services industry. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on ASB’s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Product Concentration Risk—A large percentage of ASB’s loans and securities are collateralized by real estate, and adverse changes in the real estate market and/or general economic or other conditions may result in loan losses and adversely affect the Company’s profitability.  As of December 31, 2020 approximately 79% of ASB’s loan portfolio was comprised of loans primarily collateralized by real estate, most of which was concentrated in the State of Hawaii. During 2020, ASB’s home equity lines of credit (HELOC) and residential 1-4 family portfolios decreased by 12% and 2%, respectively, and now comprise 73% of total real estate loans. ASB’s financial results may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions, either nationally or in the state of Hawaii, including decreases in real estate values, adverse employment conditions, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal and state government and other significant external events. Adverse changes in the economy may have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans. A deterioration of the economic environment in Hawaii, including a material decline in the real estate market, further declines in home resales, a material external shock, or any environmental clean-up obligation, may also significantly impair the value of ASB’s collateral and ASB’s ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. In the event of a default, amounts received upon sale of the collateral may be insufficient to recover outstanding principal and interest. In addition, if poor economic conditions result in decreased demand for real estate loans, ASB’s profits may decrease if its alternative investments earn less income than real estate loans.Commercial and Consumer Lending Risk—Expanding commercial, commercial real estate and consumer lending activities may result in higher costs and greater credit risk than residential lending activities due to the unique characteristics of these markets.  ASB had been pursuing a strategy that included expanding its commercial, commercial real estate and consumer lines of business. Commercial and commercial real estate loans have a higher risk profile than residential loans. Though both commercial and commercial real estate loans have shorter terms and earn higher spreads than residential mortgage loans, these loan types generally entail higher underwriting and other service costs and present greater credit risks than traditional residential mortgages. Commercial loans are secured by the assets of the business and, upon default, any collateral repossessed may not be sufficient to repay the outstanding loan balance. In addition, loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and, thus, are more likely to be affected by current economic conditions and adverse business developments. Commercial real estate properties tend to be unique and are more difficult to value than residential real estate properties. Commercial real estate loans may not be fully amortizing, meaning that they have a significant principal balance or “balloon” payment due at maturity. In addition, commercial real estate properties, particularly industrial and warehouse properties, are generally subject to relatively greater environmental risks than noncommercial properties and to the corresponding burdens and costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Also, there may be costs and delays involved in enforcing rights of a property owner against tenants in default under terms of leases with respect to commercial properties. For example, a tenant may seek protection under bankruptcy laws, which could result in termination of the tenant’s lease.ASB also has a national syndicated lending portfolio where ASB is a participant in credit facilities agented by established and reputable national lenders. Management selectively chooses each deal based on conservative credit criteria to ensure a high-quality, well diversified portfolio. In the event the borrower encounters financial difficulties and ASB is unable to sell its participation interest in the loan in the secondary market, ASB is typically reliant on the originating lender for managing any loan workout or foreclosure proceedings that may become necessary. Accordingly, ASB has less control over such proceedings 28than loans it originates and may be required to accommodate the interests of other participating lenders in resolving delinquencies or defaults on participated loans, which could result in outcomes that are not fully consistent with ASB’s preferred strategies. In addition, a significant proportion of ASB’s syndicated loans are originated in states other than Hawaii and are subject to the local regional and regulatory risks specific to those states.Similar to the national syndicated lending portfolio, ASB does not service commercial loans in which it has participation interests rather than being the lead or agent lender and is subject to the policies and practices of the agent lender, who is the loan servicer, in resolving delinquencies or defaults on participated loans.The consumer loan portfolio primarily consists of personal unsecured loans with risk-based pricing. Repayment is based on the borrower’s financial stability as these loans have no collateral and there is less assurance that ASB will be able to collect all payments due under these loans or have sufficient collateral to cover all outstanding loan balances.General Risk Factors
.ESG Risk—Increased scrutiny and changing stakeholder expectations with respect to our environmental, social and governance (ESG) programs may result in increased costs and expenses and may expose us to new or incremental risks.  Companies across all industries, including our businesses, face increasing stakeholder scrutiny related to ESG practices. These stakeholders include investors, customers, consumers, employees, lenders and other stakeholders, and in recent years, certain stakeholders have placed increasing importance on the impact and social cost of their investments. This increased focus and activism related to ESG may hinder the cost of, or access to, capital or financing as these investors or lenders may elect to increase their required returns on capital offered to the company, reallocate capital or not commit capital as a result of their assessment of a company’s ESG profile. Additionally, if we fail to adapt, or perceived to have failed in addressing investor, lender, and other stakeholder ESG expectations or standards, which continue to evolve, or if we fail to fully and accurately report our progress on ESG initiatives, we may suffer reputational damage and our business or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.Human Capital Risk—HEI’s businesses may be unable to attract, hire, engage and retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce, including senior management, which could affect the Company’s execution of its growth strategy and profitability and adversely affect its future performance. The skill and experience of the Company’s employees, particularly with respect to the senior management team, are vital to the Company’s success. The management teams of HEI’s businesses have significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent, to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the senior management team, or to maintain a successful work culture that fosters collaboration, innovation, and communications could disrupt the Company’s operations and adversely affect its businesses and its future success. Pension Liability Risk—HEI and Hawaiian Electric and their subsidiaries may incur higher retirement benefits expenses and have and will likely continue to recognize substantial liabilities for retirement benefits.  Retirement benefits expenses and cash funding requirements could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the performance of the U.S. equity markets, trends in interest rates and health care costs, plan amendments, mortality improvements, new laws relating to pension funding and changes in accounting principles. For the Utilities, however, retirement benefits expenses, as adjusted by the pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions (OPEB) tracking mechanisms, have been an allowable expense for rate-making purposes.Tax Legislation Risk—Adverse tax rulings or developments or changes in tax legislation could result in significant increases in tax payments and/or expense.  Governmental taxing authorities could challenge a tax return position taken by HEI or its subsidiaries and, if the taxing authorities prevail, HEI’s consolidated tax payments and/or expense, including applicable penalties and interest, could increase significantly. Additionally, changes in tax legislation or IRS interpretations could increase the Company’s tax burden and adversely affect the Company's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Litigation Risk—The Company could be subject to the risk of uninsured losses in excess of its accruals for litigation matters.  HEI and its subsidiaries are involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of their businesses, most of which is covered by insurance (subject to policy limits and deductibles). However, other litigation may arise that is not routine or involves claims that may not be covered by insurance. Because of the uncertainties associated with litigation, there is a risk that litigation against HEI or its subsidiaries, even if vigorously defended, could result in costs of defense and judgment or settlement amounts not covered by insurance and in excess of reserves established in HEI’s consolidated financial statements.Changes in Accounting Estimates Risk—Changes in accounting principles and estimates could affect the reported amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities or revenues and expenses.  HEI’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Changes in accounting principles (including the possible adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards or new U.S. accounting standards), or changes in the Company’s application of existing accounting principles, could materially affect the financial statement presentation of HEI’s or the 29Utilities’ consolidated results of operations and/or financial condition. Further, in preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the amounts reported for electric utility revenues; allowance for credit losses; income taxes; investment securities, property, plant and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; derivatives; goodwill; pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; and contingencies and litigation.Changes in accounting principles can also impact HEI’s consolidated financial statements. For example, if management determines that a PPA requires the consolidation of the IPP in the financial statements, the consolidation could have a material effect on Hawaiian Electric’s and HEI’s consolidated financial statements, including the recognition of a significant amount of assets and liabilities and, if such a consolidated IPP were operating at a loss and had insufficient equity, the potential recognition of such losses"
0,HE,HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC INDS,2020-02-28,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSThe businesses of HEI and its subsidiaries involve numerous risks which, if realized, could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements. For additional information for certain risk factors enumerated below and other risks of the Company and its operations, see “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” above and HEI’s MD&A, HEI’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Hawaiian Electric’s MD&A and Hawaiian Electric’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”Holding company and company-wide risks.HEI is a holding company that derives its income from its operating subsidiaries and depends on the ability of those subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI and on its own ability to raise capital.  HEI is a legal entity separate and distinct from its various subsidiaries. As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, HEI’s cash flows and consequent ability to service its obligations and pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon its receipt of dividends or other distributions from its operating subsidiaries and its ability to issue common stock or other equity securities and to incur additional debt. The ability of HEI’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI, in turn, is subject to the risks associated with their operations and to contractual and regulatory restrictions, including:•the provisions of an HEI agreement with the PUC, which could limit the ability of HEI’s principal electric public utility subsidiary, Hawaiian Electric, to pay dividends to HEI in the event that the consolidated common stock equity of the Utilities falls below 35% of total capitalization of the electric utilities;•the provisions of an HEI agreement entered into with federal bank regulators in connection with its acquisition of its bank subsidiary, ASB, which require HEI to contribute additional capital to ASB (up to a maximum amount of additional capital of $28.3 million as of December 31, 2019 under the Regulatory Capital Maintenance/Dividend Agreement dated May 26, 1988, between HEI, HEIDI (HEI Diversified Inc.) and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation) upon request of the regulators in order to maintain ASB’s regulatory capital at the level required by regulation;•the minimum capital and capital distribution regulations of the OCC that are applicable to ASB and capital regulations that become applicable to HEI and ASB Hawaii;•the receipt of a letter from the FRB communicating the OCC’s and FRB’s non-objection to the payment of any dividend ASB proposes to declare and pay to ASB Hawaii and HEI; and•the provisions of preferred stock resolutions and debt instruments of HEI and its subsidiaries.The Company, and its credit rating, is subject to risks associated with the Hawaii economy (in the aggregate and on an individual island basis), volatile U.S. capital markets and changes in the interest rate and credit market environment that have or could result in higher retirement benefit plan funding requirements, declines in ASB’s interest rate margins and investment values, higher delinquencies and charge-offs in ASB’s loan portfolio and restrictions on the ability of HEI or its subsidiaries to borrow money or issue securities.  The two largest components of Hawaii’s economy are tourism and the federal government (including the military). Because the core businesses of HEI’s subsidiaries are providing local public electric utility services (through Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries) and banking services (through ASB) in Hawaii, the Company’s operating results are significantly influenced by Hawaii’s economy, which in turn is influenced by economic conditions in the mainland U.S. (particularly California) and Asia (particularly Japan) as a result of the impact of those conditions on tourism, by the impact of interest rates on the construction and real estate industries and by the impact of federal government spending in Hawaii, which can be affected by world conditions and, from time to time, the expiration of federal government appropriations bills. In addition, the Hawaii economy could be directly or indirectly affected by implications and potential impacts of U.S. and foreign capital and credit market conditions and federal, state and international responses to those conditions and the potential impacts of global and local developments (including economic conditions and uncertainties; unrest, terrorist acts, wars, conflicts, political protests, deadly virus epidemic, potential pandemics, or other crisis; the effects of changes that have or may occur in U.S. policy, such as with respect to immigration and trade).The recent outbreak of the coronavirus, COVID-19, first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, has the potential to impact economic conditions in Hawaii, for example, through a reduction of tourism and business travel to Hawaii. Further, a prolonged outbreak could potentially impact the ability of the Company’s customers, contractors, suppliers, IPPs, and other business partners to perform or fulfill their obligations, which could adversely affect the Company’s businesses. For instance, restrictions on business activities due to COVID-19 may disrupt the global renewable energy supply chain that relies on Chinese manufacturing capacity for key components (such as solar modules, inverters, wind turbine components) creating project delays or material price increases for Hawaii renewable projects and procurement processes, which could potentially jeopardize the Company’s ability to achieve its RPS goals. While the Company has not been materially impacted by COVID-19 to date, the extent of the outbreak and its future impact on the Company’s businesses and its business partners is uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.17HEI’s and Hawaiian Electric’s securities ratings only reflect the view, at the time the ratings are issued, of the applicable rating agency. There is no assurance that any such credit rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such rating will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agency if, in such rating agency’s judgment, circumstances, such as current, past or future effects or events so warrant. Any such lowering, suspension or withdrawal of any rating may have an adverse effect on the availability of capital to the Company or the market price or marketability of HEI’s and/or Hawaiian Electric’s securities, which could increase the cost of capital of HEI and Hawaiian Electric, and such increased costs, including interest charges, under HEI’s and/or Hawaiian Electric’s debt securities and credit facilities, would result in reductions in HEI’s consolidated net income in future periods. Further, if HEI’s or Hawaiian Electric’s commercial paper ratings were to be downgraded, HEI and Hawaiian Electric might not be able to sell commercial paper and might be required to draw on more expensive bank lines of credit or to defer capital or other expenditures. Neither HEI nor Hawaiian Electric management can predict future rating agency actions or their effects on the future cost of capital of HEI or Hawaiian Electric. Such ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold any securities; such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies; and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.Changes in the U.S. capital markets can also have significant effects on the Company. For example, pension funding requirements are affected by the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for pension plans, and by the discount rate used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost and value obligations. The Utilities’ pension tracking mechanisms help moderate pension expense; however, the significant decline in 2008 in the value of the Company’s defined benefit pension plan assets resulted in a substantial gap between the projected benefit obligations under the plans and the value of plan assets, resulting in increases in funding requirements. The increases have moderated in recent years as investment performance has improved.Because the earnings of ASB depend primarily on net interest income, interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASB’s operations. HEI and the Utilities are also exposed to interest rate risk primarily due to their periodic borrowing requirements, the discount rate used to determine pension funding requirements and the possible effect of interest rates on the electric utilities’ rates of return. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors, including general economic conditions and the policies of government and regulatory authorities. HEI cannot predict future changes in interest rates, nor be certain that interest rate risk management strategies it or its subsidiaries have implemented will be successful in managing interest rate risk.Interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting the fair value of ASB’s investment securities. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair values of those instruments, respectively. Disruptions in the credit markets, a liquidity crisis in the banking industry or increased levels of residential mortgage delinquencies and defaults may result in decreases in the fair value of ASB’s investment securities and an impairment that is other-than-temporary, requiring ASB to write down its investment securities. As of December 31, 2019, ASB’s investment in U.S. Treasury, federal agency obligations, and mortgage-backed securities have an implicit guarantee from the U.S. government.HEI and Hawaiian Electric and their subsidiaries may incur higher retirement benefits expenses and have and will likely continue to recognize substantial liabilities for retirement benefits.  Retirement benefits expenses and cash funding requirements could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the performance of the U.S. equity markets, trends in interest rates and health care costs, plan amendments, mortality improvements, new laws relating to pension funding and changes in accounting principles. For the Utilities, however, retirement benefits expenses, as adjusted by the pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions (OPEB) tracking mechanisms, have been an allowable expense for rate-making purposes.The Company is subject to the risks associated with the geographic concentration of its businesses and current lack of interconnections that could result in service interruptions at the Utilities or higher default rates on loans held by ASB.  The business of the Utilities is concentrated on the individual islands they serve in the State of Hawaii. Their operations are more vulnerable to service interruptions than are many U.S. mainland utilities because none of the systems of the Utilities are interconnected with the systems on the other islands they serve. Because of this lack of interconnections, it is necessary to maintain higher generation reserve margins than are typical for U.S. mainland utilities to help ensure reliable service. Service interruptions, including in particular extended interruptions that could result from a natural disaster or terrorist activity, could adversely impact the revenues and costs of some or all of the Utilities.Substantially all of ASB’s consumer loan customers are Hawaii residents. A significant portion of the commercial loan customers are located in Hawaii. While a majority of customers are on Oahu, ASB also has customers on the neighbor islands (whose economies have been weaker than Oahu during the last economic downturn). Substantially all of the real estate underlying ASB’s residential and commercial real estate loans are located in Hawaii. These assets may be subject to a greater risk of default than other comparable assets held by financial institutions with other geographic concentrations in the event of 18adverse economic, political or business developments or natural disasters affecting Hawaii and affect the ability of ASB’s customers to make payments of principal and interest on their loans.Increasing competition and technological advances could cause HEI’s businesses to lose customers or render their operations obsolete.  The banking industry in Hawaii, and certain aspects of the electric utility industry, are competitive. The success of HEI’s subsidiaries in meeting competition and responding to technological advances will continue to have a direct impact on HEI’s consolidated financial performance. For example:•ASB, one of the largest financial institutions in the state, is in direct competition for deposits and loans not only with two larger institutions that have substantial capital, technology and marketing resources, but also with smaller Hawaii institutions and other U.S. institutions, including credit unions, mutual funds, mortgage brokers, finance companies and investment banking firms. Larger financial institutions may have greater access to capital at lower costs, which could impair ASB’s ability to compete effectively. New or significant advances in technology (e.g., significant advances in internet banking) could render the operations of ASB less competitive or obsolete. •The Utilities face competition from IPPs; customer self-generation, with or without cogeneration; customer energy storage; and the potential formation of community-based, cooperative ownership or municipality structures for electrical service on all islands it serves. With the exception of certain identified projects, the Utilities are required to use competitive bidding to acquire a future generation resource unless the PUC finds competitive bidding to be unsuitable. The PUC sets policies for distributed generation (DG) interconnection agreements and standby rates. The results of competitive bidding, competition from IPPs, customer self-generation, and potential cooperative ownership or municipality structures for electric utility service, and the rate at which technological developments facilitating nonutility generation of electricity, combined heat and power technology, off-grid microgrids, and customer energy storage may render the operations of the Utilities less competitive or outdated and adversely affect the Utilities and the results of their operations. The Company may be subject to information technology and operational system failures, network disruptions, cyber attacks and breaches in data security that could adversely affect its businesses and reputation. The Company and its subsidiaries rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed or hosted by third party service providers, to manage its business data, communications, and other business processes. Such information technology systems may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or other security incidents, which could result in unauthorized access to confidential data or disruptions to operations. If the Company is unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve an incident, it may have a material impact on the Company’s operations or business reputation.Utilities.  The Utilities rely on evolving and increasingly complex operational and information systems, networks and other technologies, which are interconnected with the systems and network infrastructure owned by third parties to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, invoicing and collection of payments, customer relationship management, human resource management, the acquisition, generation and delivery of electrical service to customers, and to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting and legal and tax requirements. The Utilities use their systems and infrastructure to create, collect, store, and process sensitive information, including personal information regarding customers, employees and their dependents, retirees, and other individuals. Despite the Utilities security measures, all of their systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access caused by natural disasters, cybersecurity incidents, security breaches, user error, unintentional defects created by system changes, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures or similar events. Any such failure could have a material adverse impact on the Utilities’ ability to process transactions and provide service, as well the Utilities’ financial condition and results of operations. Further, a data breach involving theft, improper disclosure, or other unauthorized access to or acquisition of confidential information could subject the Utilities to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, claims by third parties, and enforcement actions by government agencies. A data breach could also reduce the value of proprietary information, and harm the reputation of the Utilities.As noted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the utility industry is continuing to experience an increase in the frequency and sophistication of cybersecurity incidents. The Utilities’ systems have been, and will likely continue to be, a target of attacks. Further, the Utilities’ operational networks may be subject to new cybersecurity risks due to modernizing and interconnecting existing infrastructure with new technologies and control systems, including those owned by third parties.  Although the Utilities have not experienced a material cybersecurity breach to date, such incidents may occur and may have a material adverse effect on the Utilities and the Company in the future. In order to address cybersecurity risks to their information systems, the Utilities maintain security measures designed to protect their information technology systems, network infrastructure and other assets. The Utilities actively monitor developments in the area of cybersecurity and are involved in various related government and industry groups, and brief the Company’s Board quarterly on relevant cybersecurity issues. Although the Utilities continue to make investments in their cybersecurity program, including personnel, technologies, cyber insurance and training of Utilities personnel, there can be no assurance that these systems or their expected functionality will be implemented, maintained, or expanded effectively; nor can security measures completely eliminate the possibility of a 19cybersecurity breach. The Utility maintains cyber liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents. However, there is no guarantee that adequate insurance will continue to be available at rates the Utility believes are reasonable or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates. If the Utilities’ cybersecurity measures were to be breached, the Utilities could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to their reputation.Due to the size, scope and complexity of the Utilities’ business, the development and maintenance of information technology systems to process and track information is critical and challenging. The Utilities often rely on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems and these third-party vendors could cease to exist, fail to establish adequate processes to protect the Utilities systems and information, or experience internal or external security incidents. In addition, the Utilities are pursuing complex business transformation initiatives, which include establishing common processes across Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric and the upgrade or replacement of existing systems. Significant system changes increase the risk of system interruptions. Although the Utilities maintain change control processes to mitigate this risk, system interruptions may occur. Further, delay or failure to complete the integration of information systems and processes may result in delays in regulatory cost recovery, increased service interruptions of aging legacy systems, or the failure to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives.In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Utilities’ new ERP/EAM system was placed into service. One of the conditions imposed by the PUC’s approval of the system is the requirement that the Utilities achieve cost savings consistent with a minimum of $246 million in ERP/EAM project-related benefits to be delivered to customers over the system’s 12-year service life. If the Utilities are not able to achieve such minimum savings, the PUC could impose financial penalties, such as a reduction of revenue requirements that could have a material adverse impact the Utilities’ and Company’s results of operations and financial condition.The Utilities have disaster recovery plans in place to protect their businesses from information technology service interruptions. The disaster recovery plans, however, may not be successful in preventing the loss of customer data, service interruptions and disruptions to operations or damage to important facilities. If any of these systems fail to operate properly or becomes disabled and the Utilities’ disaster recovery plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, the Utilities could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to their reputations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities’ and the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.ASB.  ASB is highly dependent on its ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions and relies heavily on communication and information systems, including those of third-party vendors and other service providers. Communication and information system failures can result from a variety of risks including, but not limited to, events that are wholly or partially out of ASB’s control, such as communication line integrity, weather, terrorist acts, natural disasters, accidental disasters, unauthorized breaches of security systems, energy delivery systems, cyberattacks and other events.ASB is under continuous threat of loss due to cyberattacks, especially as ASB continues to expand customer capabilities to utilize the Internet and other remote channels to transact business. Two of the most significant cyberattack risks that ASB faces are e-fraud and loss of sensitive customer data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals extract funds directly from customers’ or ASB’s accounts using fraudulent schemes that may include Internet-based funds transfers. ASB has been subject to e-fraud incidents historically. Loss of sensitive customer data are attempts to steal sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, through unauthorized access to computer systems, including computer hacking. Such attacks are less frequent, but could present significant reputational, legal and regulatory costs if successful. Intrusion detection and prevention systems, anti-virus software, firewalls and other general information technology controls have been put in place to detect and prevent cyberattacks or information system breaches. A disaster recovery plan has been developed in the event of a natural disaster, security breach, military or terrorist action, power or communication failure or similar event. The disaster recovery plan, however, may not be successful in preventing the loss of customer data, service interruptions, disruptions to operations or damage to important facilities. Although ASB devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of ASB’s computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to ASB and its customers, there can be no assurance that such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately corrected by ASB or its vendors.If any of these systems fail to operate properly or become disabled even for a brief period of time, ASB could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to its reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on ASB’s and the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. HEI’s businesses could suffer losses that are uninsured due to a lack of affordable insurance coverage, unavailability of insurance coverage or limitations on the insurance coverage the Company does have.  In the ordinary course of business, HEI 20and its subsidiaries purchase insurance coverages (e.g., property and liability coverages) to protect against loss of, or damage to, their properties and against claims made by third parties and employees for property damage or personal injuries. However, the protection provided by such insurance is limited in significant respects and, in some instances, there is no coverage. Some of the insurance coverages have substantial deductibles or has limits on the maximum amounts that may be recovered.  In common with other companies in its line of business, the Utilities’ overhead and underground transmission and distribution systems (with the exception of substation buildings and contents), which have a replacement value roughly estimated at $8 billion, are largely not insured against loss or damage because the amount of transmission and distribution system insurance capacity is limited and the premiums are cost prohibitive. Similarly, the Utilities have no business interruption insurance as the premiums for such insurance would be cost prohibitive, particularly since the Utilities are not interconnected to other systems. If a hurricane or other uninsured catastrophic natural disaster were to occur, and if the PUC did not allow the affected Utilities to recover from ratepayers restoration costs and revenues lost from business interruption, the lost revenues and repair expenses could result in a significant decrease in HEI’s consolidated net income or in significant net losses for the affected periods.ASB generally does not obtain credit enhancements, such as mortgagor bankruptcy insurance, but does require standard hazard and hurricane insurance and may require flood insurance for certain properties. ASB is subject to the risks of borrower defaults and bankruptcies, special hazard losses not covered by the required insurance and the insurance company’s inability to pay claims on existing policies.Increased federal and state environmental regulation will require an increasing commitment of resources and funds and could result in construction delays or penalties and fines for non-compliance. HEI and its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, hazardous substances, waste management, natural resources and health and safety, which regulate, among other matters, the operation of existing facilities, the construction and operation of new facilities and the proper cleanup and disposal of hazardous and toxic wastes and substances. These laws and regulations could result in increased capital, operating, and other costs. HEI or its subsidiaries are currently involved in investigatory or remedial actions at current, former or third-party sites and there is no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs relating to these sites. In addition, compliance with these legal requirements requires the Utilities to commit significant resources and funds toward, among other things, environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment and payment of emission fees. These laws and regulations, among other things, require that certain environmental permits be obtained in order to construct or operate certain facilities, and obtaining such permits can entail significant expense and cause substantial construction delays. Also, these laws and regulations may be amended from time to time, including amendments that increase the burden and cost of compliance. For example, emission and/or discharge limits may be tightened, more extensive permitting requirements may be imposed and additional substances may become regulated. In addition, significant regulatory uncertainty exists regarding the impact of federal or state greenhouse gas emission limits and reductions.If HEI or its subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond their control, that failure may result in civil or criminal penalties and fines or the cessation of operations that could have a material adverse on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Adverse tax rulings or developments or changes in tax legislation could result in significant increases in tax payments and/or expense.  Governmental taxing authorities could challenge a tax return position taken by HEI or its subsidiaries and, if the taxing authorities prevail, HEI’s consolidated tax payments and/or expense, including applicable penalties and interest, could increase significantly. Additionally, changes in tax legislation or IRS interpretations could increase the Company’s tax burden and adversely affect the Company's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The Company could be subject to the risk of uninsured losses in excess of its accruals for litigation matters.  HEI and its subsidiaries are involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of their businesses, most of which is covered by insurance (subject to policy limits and deductibles). However, other litigation may arise that is not routine or involves claims that may not be covered by insurance. Because of the uncertainties associated with litigation, there is a risk that litigation against HEI or its subsidiaries, even if vigorously defended, could result in costs of defense and judgment or settlement amounts not covered by insurance and in excess of reserves established in HEI’s consolidated financial statements.Changes in accounting principles and estimates could affect the reported amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities or revenues and expenses.  HEI’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Changes in accounting principles (including the possible adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards or new U.S. accounting standards), or changes in the Company’s application of existing accounting principles, could materially affect the financial statement presentation of HEI’s or the Utilities’ consolidated results of operations and/or financial condition. Further, in preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. 21Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the amounts reported for electric utility revenues; allowance for loan losses; income taxes; investment securities, property, plant and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; derivatives; goodwill; pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; and contingencies and litigation.The Utilities’ financial statements reflect assets and costs based on cost-based rate-making regulations. Continued accounting in this manner requires that certain criteria relating to the recoverability of such costs through rates be met. If events or circumstances should change such that the criteria are no longer satisfied, the Utilities’ expect that their regulatory assets (amounting to $715 million as of December 31, 2019), net of regulatory liabilities (amounting to $972 million as of December 31, 2019), would be charged to the statement of income in the period of discontinuance. Changes in accounting principles can also impact HEI’s consolidated financial statements. For example, if management determines that a PPA requires the consolidation of the IPP in the financial statements, the consolidation could have a material effect on Hawaiian Electric’s and HEI’s consolidated financial statements, including the recognition of a significant amount of assets and liabilities and, if such a consolidated IPP were operating at a loss and had insufficient equity, the potential recognition of such losses.  Changes in the accounting principles for expected credit losses were issued by the FASB to replace existing impairment models, including replacing an “incurred loss” model for loans with a “current expected credit loss” model based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The changes also require enhanced disclosures to help financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization’s portfolio. The Company will adopt the new accounting principle using an effective date of January 1, 2020, and is in the process of finalizing its analysis. The Company estimates that the increase in the allowance for credit losses as of the adoption date will be between $18 million to $22 million. Electric utility risks.The following risks are generally specific to Hawaiian Electric, but could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Actions of the PUC are outside the control of the Utilities and could result in inadequate or untimely rate increases, in rate reductions or refunds or in unanticipated delays, expenses or writedowns in connection with the construction of new projects.  The rates the Utilities are allowed to charge for their services and the timeliness of permitted rate increases are among the most important items influencing the Utilities’ results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The PUC has broad discretion over the rates that the Utilities charge their customers. As part of the decoupling mechanism that the Utilities have implemented, each of the Utilities will file a rate case once every three years. Any adverse decision by the PUC concerning the level or method of determining electric utility rates, the items and amounts that may be included in rate base, the returns on equity or rate base found to be reasonable, the potential consequences of exceeding or not meeting such returns, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding could have a material adverse effect on Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.To improve the timing and certainty of the recovery of their costs, the Utilities have proposed and/or received approval of various cost recovery mechanisms including an ECRC (changed from ECAC in 2019), a PPAC, and pension and OPEB tracking mechanisms, as well as a decoupling mechanism, a major project interim recovery (MPIR) adjustment mechanism, and a renewable energy infrastructure program (REIP) surcharge. A change in, or the elimination of, any of these cost recovery mechanisms, could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities. See “Regulatory mechanisms” in Electric Utility’s Business.On April 18, 2018, the PUC issued an order, instituting a proceeding to investigate performance-based regulation (PBR). The PUC’s implementation of performance-based ratemaking for the Utilities pursuant to Act 005, Session Laws 2018, could include, but is not limited to, the potential addition of new performance incentive mechanisms, the adoption of third-party proposals by the PUC in its implementation of PBR, and penalties for not achieving performance incentive goals. The impacts of the implementation of PBR cannot be predicted and these impacts could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities. See “Performance-based regulation proceeding” in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.The Utilities could be required to refund to their customers, with interest, revenues that have been or may be received under interim rate orders in their rate case proceedings and other proceedings, if and to the extent they exceed the amounts allowed in final orders.Many public utility projects require PUC approval and various permits (e.g., environmental and land use permits) from other governmental agencies. Difficulties in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, the necessary approvals or permits, or any adverse decision or policy made or adopted, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision, by an agency with respect to such approvals and permits, can result in significantly increased project costs or even cancellation of projects. In the event a project does not proceed, or if the PUC disallows cost recovery for all or part of a project, or if project costs exceed caps imposed by 22the PUC in its approval of the project, project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could result in significant reductions in Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated net income. Energy cost recovery clauses. The rate schedules of each of the Utilities include ECRCs (changed from ECACs in 2019—see below) under which electric rates charged to customers are automatically adjusted for changes in the weighted-average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power, and the relative amounts of company-generated power and purchased power. ECRCs are subject to periodic review by the PUC. In recent rate cases, the PUC has approved an additional trigger that would allow a re-establishment of fuel usage efficiency targets under certain conditions and annual automatic adjustments of fuel usage efficiency targets for all Utilities. In the most recent rate cases for the Utilities, the PUC approved revised ECRCs for the Utilities, which transferred the remaining fuel and purchased energy expenses recovery from base rates to the ECRCs. Effective January 1, 2019, ECRC for Hawaiian Electric provides for a 98/2% risk-sharing split between ratepayers and Hawaiian Electric, of fossil fuel prices above or below a baseline price and the fuel usage efficiency pass-through within a range, with an annual maximum exposure cap of $2.5 million. Effective September 1, 2019, the ECRC for Maui Electric reflects 98/2% risk-sharing split between ratepayers and Maui Electric, with an annual maximum exposure cap of $0.6 million. Hawaii Electric Light’s ECRC does not have a risk-sharing split. See “Most recent rate proceedings” in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.A change in, or the elimination of, the ECRC could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities.Electric utility operations are significantly influenced by weather conditions.  The Utilities’ results of operations can be affected by the weather and natural disasters. Weather conditions, particularly temperature and humidity, directly influence the demand for electricity. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, lava flows and lightning storms, some of which may become more severe or frequent as a result of global climate changes, can cause outages and property damage and require the Utilities to incur significant additional expenses that may not be recoverable.Electric utility operations may be significantly influenced by climate change.  While the timing, extent and ultimate effects of climate change cannot be determined with any certainty, climate change is predicted to result in sea level rise, which could potentially impact coastal and other low-lying areas (where much of the Utilities’ electric infrastructure is sited), and could cause erosion of beaches, saltwater intrusion into aquifers and surface ecosystems, higher water tables and increased flooding and storm damage due to heavy rainfall. The effects of climate change on the weather (for example, floods, hurricanes, heat waves or drought conditions, the latter of which could increase wildfire risk), sea levels, and water availability and quality, all have the potential to materially adversely affect the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities. For example, severe weather and its related impacts could cause significant harm to the Utilities’ physical facilities. Electric utility operations depend heavily on third-party suppliers of fuel and purchased power.  The Utilities rely on fuel  suppliers and shippers, and IPPs to deliver fuel and power, respectively, in accordance with contractual agreements. Approximately 72% of the net energy generated or purchased by the Utilities in 2019 was generated from the burning of fossil fuel oil, and purchases of power by the Utilities provided about 46% of their total net energy generated and purchased for the same period. Failure or delay by fuel suppliers and shippers to provide fuel pursuant to existing contracts, or failure by a major IPP to deliver the firm capacity anticipated in its PPA, could disrupt the ability of the Utilities to deliver electricity and require the Utilities to incur additional expenses to meet the needs of their customers that may not be recoverable. In addition, as the IPP contracts near the end of their terms, there may be less economic incentive for the IPPs to make investments in their units to ensure the availability of their units. Also, as these contractual agreements end, the Utilities may not be able to purchase fuel and power on terms equivalent to the current contractual agreements.The capacity provided by the Utilities’ generating resources and third-party purchased power may not be sufficient to meet customers’ energy requirements.  The Utilities rely upon their generating resources and purchased power from third parties to meet their customers’ energy requirements. The Utilities update their generation capacity evaluation each year to determine the Utilities’ ability to meet reasonably expected demands for service and provide reasonable reserves for emergencies. These evaluations are impacted by a variety of factors, including customer energy demand, energy conservation and efficiency initiatives, economic conditions, and weather patterns. If the capacity provided by the Utilities’ generating resources and third-party purchased power is not adequate relative to customer demand, the Utilities may have to contract to buy more power from third parties, invest in additional generating facilities over the long-term, or extend the operating life of existing utility units. Any failure to meet customer energy requirements could negatively impact the satisfaction of the Utilities’ customers, which could have an adverse impact on the Utilities’ business and results of operations. Electric utility and third-party purchased power projects may be significantly impacted by stakeholder activism.  The potential impact of stakeholder activism could increase total utility project costs, and delay the permitting, construction and overall timing or preclude the completion of third-party or utility projects that are required to meet electricity demand, 23resilience and reliability objectives, and RPS goals. If a utility project cannot be completed, the project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could result in significant reductions in Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated net income. Electric utility generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated and/or increased operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs.  Operation of electric generating facilities involves certain risks which can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels. Included among these risks are facility shutdowns or power interruptions due to insufficient generation or a breakdown or failure of equipment or processes. In addition, operations could be negatively impacted by interruptions in fuel supply, inability to negotiate satisfactory collective bargaining agreements when existing agreements expire or other labor disputes, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements, disruptions in delivery of electricity, operator error and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, fires, explosions, floods or other similar occurrences affecting the Utilities’ generating facilities or transmission and distribution systems.The Utilities may be adversely affected by new legislation or administrative actions.  Congress, the Hawaii legislature and governmental agencies periodically consider legislation and other initiatives that could have uncertain or negative effects on the Utilities and their customers. Congress, the Hawaii legislature and governmental agencies have adopted, or are considering adopting, a number of measures that will significantly affect the Utilities, as described below.Renewable Portfolio Standards law.  In 2015, Hawaii’s RPS law was amended to require electric utilities to meet an RPS of 15%, 30%, 40%, 70% and 100% by December 31, 2015, 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2045 respectively. Energy savings resulting from energy efficiency programs do not count toward the RPS after 2014. The Utilities are committed to achieving these goals and met the 2015 RPS; however, due to the exclusion of energy savings in calculating RPS after 2014 and risks such as potential delays in IPPs being able to deliver contracted renewable energy, it is possible the Utilities may not attain the required renewable percentages in the future, and management cannot predict the future consequences of failure to do so (including potential penalties to be assessed by the PUC). On December 19, 2008, the PUC approved a penalty of $20 for every MWh that an electric utility is deficient under Hawaii’s RPS law. The PUC noted, however, that this penalty may be reduced, in the PUC’s discretion, due to events or circumstances that are outside an electric utility’s reasonable control, to the extent the event or circumstance could not be reasonably foreseen and ameliorated, as described in the RPS law and in an RPS framework adopted by the PUC. In addition, the PUC ordered that the Utilities will be prohibited from recovering any RPS penalty costs through rates.Renewable energy.  In 2007, a measure was passed by the Hawaii legislature stating that the PUC may consider the need for increased renewable energy in rendering decisions on utility matters. Due to this measure, it is possible that, if energy from a renewable source is more expensive than energy from fossil fuel, the PUC may still approve the purchase of energy from the renewable source, resulting in higher costs.Global climate change and greenhouse gas emissions reduction.  National and international concern about climate change and the contribution of GHG emissions (including carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels) to climate change have led to federal legislative and regulatory proposals and action by the state of Hawaii to reduce GHG emissions. In July 2007, the State Legislature passed Act 234, which requires a statewide reduction of GHG emissions by January 1, 2020 to levels at or below the statewide GHG emission levels in 1990. On June 20, 2014, the Governor signed the final rules required to implement Act 234 and these rules went into effect on June 30, 2014. In general, Act 234 and the GHG rule require affected sources that have the potential to emit GHGs in excess of established thresholds to reduce their GHG emissions by 16% below 2010 emission levels by 2020. In accordance with State requirements, the Utilities submitted an Emissions Reduction Plan (ERP) to the DOH on June 30, 2015. The Utilities submitted a revised ERP on October 17, 2018 and subsequent revisions on May 15, 2019 and July 26, 2019, to reflect the partnership established between the Utilities and several IPPs. In this plan, the partnership has committed to a 16% reduction in GHG emissions in accordance with the rule. As of December 31, 2019, the permits that were pending that would have incorporated the ERP have not been approved, and are subject to additional public review and potential challenge. Additionally, the loss of the PGV facility on Hawaii Island, unseasonable weather and the delay of additional renewable projects will make these goals more challenging in the immediate future. It is expected that with the advent of additional renewable projects and the application to the PUC with respect to the PGV project, the goals should be attainable. The Utilities have taken, and continue to identify opportunities to take, direct action to reduce GHG emissions from their operations, including, but not limited to, supporting demand-side management programs that foster energy efficiency, using renewable resources for energy production and purchasing power from IPPs generated by renewable resources, and burning renewable biodiesel at selected Hawaiian Electric and Maui Electric generating units. 24Performance-based regulation legislation.  On April 24, 2018, Act 005, Session Laws 2018 was signed into law, which establishes performance metrics that the PUC shall consider while establishing performance incentives and penalty mechanisms under a performance-based ratemaking model. The law requires that the PUC establish these performance-based ratemaking mechanisms on or before January 1, 2020. The PUC opened a proceeding on April 18, 2018 to investigate performance-based regulation for the Utilities. See “Performance-based regulation proceedings” in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The foregoing legislation or legislation that now is, or may in the future be, proposed present risks and uncertainties for the Utilities.The Utilities may be subject to increased operational challenges and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely impacted in meeting the commitments and objectives of clean energy initiatives and Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS).  The far-reaching nature of the Utilities’ renewable energy commitments and the RPS goals present risks to the Company. Among such risks are: (1) the dependence on third-party suppliers of renewable purchased energy, which if the Utilities are unsuccessful in negotiating purchased power agreements with such IPPs or if a major IPP fails to deliver the anticipated capacity and/or energy in its purchased power agreement, could impact the Utilities’ achievement of their commitments to RPS goals and/or the Utilities’ ability to deliver reliable service; (2) delays in acquiring or unavailability of non-fossil fuel supplies for renewable generation; (3) the impact of intermittent power to the electrical grid and reliability of service if appropriate supporting infrastructure is not installed or does not operate effectively; (4) the likelihood that the Utilities may need to make substantial investments in related infrastructure, which could result in increased borrowings and, therefore, materially impact the financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities; and (5) the commitment to support a variety of initiatives, which, if approved by the PUC, may have a material impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the Utilities depending on their design and implementation. These initiatives include, but are not limited to, programs to enable more customer-sited generation. The implementation of these or other programs may adversely impact the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities.Bank risks.The following risks are generally specific to ASB, but could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Fluctuations in interest rates could result in lower net interest income, impair ASB’s ability to originate new loans or impair the ability of ASB’s adjustable-rate borrowers to make increased payments or cause such borrowers to repay their adjustable-rate loans.  Interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASB’s operations. ASB’s net interest income consists primarily of interest income received on fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, mortgage-backed securities and investments, less interest expense consisting primarily of interest paid on deposits and other borrowings. Interest rate risk arises when earning assets mature or when their interest rates change in a time frame different from that of the costing liabilities. Changes in market interest rates, including changes in the relationship between short-term and long-term market interest rates (e.g., a flat or an inverted yield curve) or between different interest rate indices, and the duration and severity of the changes in market interest rates can impact ASB’s net interest margin. See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.” Although ASB pursues an asset-liability management strategy designed to mitigate its risk from changes in market interest rates, unfavorable movements in interest rates could result in lower net interest income. Residential 1-4 family fixed-rate mortgage loans comprised about 40% of ASB’s loan portfolio as of December 31, 2019 and do not re-price with movements in interest rates. ASB continues to face a challenging interest rate environment. Increases in market interest rates could have an adverse impact on ASB’s cost of funds. Higher market interest rates could lead to higher interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Significant increases in market interest rates, or the perception that an increase may occur, could adversely affect ASB’s ability to originate new loans and grow. An increase in market interest rates, especially a sudden increase, could also adversely affect the ability of ASB’s adjustable-rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations. If this occurred, it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets and charge-offs. Conversely, a decrease in interest rates or a mismatching of maturities of interest sensitive financial instruments could result in an acceleration in the prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities and impact ASB’s ability to reinvest its liquidity in similar yielding assets.Changes in the method for determining London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the potential replacement of LIBOR may affect our loan portfolio and interest income on loans. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether or not LIBOR will cease to exist at that time or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee composed of large U.S. financial institutions, announced replacement of U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by U.S. Treasury securities called the Secured Overnight Financing 25Rate (SOFR). The potential effect of the elimination of LIBOR on ASB’s LIBOR-indexed loan portfolio and interest income on loans cannot yet be determined.ASB’s operations are affected by factors that are beyond its control, that could result in lower revenues, higher expenses or decreased demand for its products and services.  ASB’s results of operations depend primarily on the income generated by the supply of, and demand for, its products and services, which primarily consist of loans and deposit services. ASB’s revenues and expenses may be adversely affected by various factors, including:•local, regional, national and other economic and political conditions that could result in declines in employment and real estate values, which in turn could adversely affect the ability of borrowers to make loan payments and the ability of ASB to recover the full amounts owing to it under defaulted loans;•the ability of borrowers to obtain insurance and the ability of ASB to place insurance where borrowers fail to do so, particularly in the event of catastrophic damage to collateral securing loans made by ASB;•faster than expected loan prepayments that can cause an acceleration of the amortization of premiums on loans and investments and the impairment of mortgage servicing assets of ASB;•changes in ASB’s loan portfolio credit profiles and asset quality, which may increase or decrease the required level of allowance for loan losses;•technological disruptions affecting ASB’s operations or financial or operational difficulties experienced by any outside vendor on whom ASB relies to provide key components of its business operations, such as business processing, network access or internet connections;•events of default and foreclosure of loans whereby ASB becomes the owner of a mortgage properties that presents environmental risk or potential clean up liability;•the impact of legislative and regulatory changes, including changes affecting capital requirements, increasing oversight of and reporting by banks, or affecting the lending programs or other business activities of ASB;•additional legislative changes regulating the assessment of overdraft, interchange and credit card fees, which can have a negative impact on noninterest income;•public opinion about ASB and financial institutions in general, which, if negative, could impact the public’s trust and confidence in ASB and adversely affect ASB’s ability to attract and retain customers and expose ASB to adverse legal and regulatory consequences;•increases in operating costs (including employee compensation expense and benefits and regulatory compliance costs), inflation and other factors, that exceed increases in ASB’s net interest, fee and other income; and•the ability of ASB to maintain or increase the level of deposits, ASB’s lowest costing funds.Banking and related regulations could result in significant restrictions being imposed on ASB’s business or in a requirement that HEI divest ASB.  ASB is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the Department of Treasury, the OCC and the FDIC, and is subject to reserve requirements established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In addition, the FRB is responsible for regulating ASB’s holding companies, HEI and ASB Hawaii. The regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies to address not only ASB’s compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations, but also capital adequacy, asset quality, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity and various other factors.Under certain circumstances, including any determination that ASB’s relationship with HEI results in an unsafe and unsound banking practice, these regulatory authorities have the authority to restrict the ability of ASB to transfer assets and to make distributions to its shareholders (including payment of dividends to HEI), or they could seek to require HEI to sever its relationship with or divest its ownership of ASB. Payment by ASB of dividends to HEI may also be restricted by the OCC and FRB under its prompt corrective action regulations or its capital distribution regulations if ASB’s capital position deteriorates. In order to maintain its status as a QTL, ASB is required to maintain at least 65% of its assets in “qualified thrift investments.” Institutions that fail to maintain QTL status are subject to various penalties, including limitations on their activities. In ASB’s case, the activities of HEI and HEI’s other subsidiaries would also be subject to restrictions, and a failure or inability to comply with those restrictions could effectively result in the required divestiture of ASB. Federal legislation has also been proposed in the past that could operate to eliminate the thrift charter or the grandfathered status of HEI as a unitary thrift holding company, which in turn would result in a required divestiture of ASB. In the event of a required divestiture, federal law substantially limits the types of entities that could potentially acquire ASB.Recent legislative and regulatory initiatives could have an adverse effect on ASB’s business.  The Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July 2010, has had a substantial impact on the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes a framework through which regulatory reform will be written and changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies could affect HEI and ASB in substantial and unpredictable ways. A major component of the Dodd-Frank Act is the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that has the responsibility for setting and enforcing clear, consistent rules relating to consumer financial products and services and has the authority to prohibit practices it finds to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. 26Compliance with any such directives could have adverse effects on ASB’s revenues or operating costs. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on ASB’s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.A large percentage of ASB’s loans and securities are collateralized by real estate, and adverse changes in the real estate market and/or general economic or other conditions may result in loan losses and adversely affect the Company’s profitability.  As of December 31, 2019 approximately 82% of ASB’s loan portfolio was comprised of loans primarily collateralized by real estate, most of which was concentrated in the State of Hawaii. During 2019, ASB’s HELOC and residential 1-4 family portfolios grew by 12% and 2%, respectively, and now comprise 78% of total real estate loans. ASB’s financial results may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions, either nationally or in the state of Hawaii, including decreases in real estate values, adverse employment conditions, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal and state government and other significant external events. Adverse changes in the economy may have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans. A deterioration of the economic environment in Hawaii, including a material decline in the real estate market, further declines in home resales, a material external shock, or any environmental clean-up obligation, may also significantly impair the value of ASB’s collateral and ASB’s ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. In the event of a default, amounts received upon sale of the collateral may be insufficient to recover outstanding principal and interest. In addition, if poor economic conditions result in decreased demand for real estate loans, ASB’s profits may decrease if its alternative investments earn less income than real estate loans.Expanding commercial, commercial real estate and consumer lending activities may result in higher costs and greater credit risk than residential lending activities due to the unique characteristics of these markets.  ASB had been pursuing a strategy that included expanding its commercial, commercial real estate and consumer lines of business. Commercial and commercial real estate loans have a higher risk profile than residential loans. Though both commercial and commercial real estate loans have shorter terms and earn higher spreads than residential mortgage loans, these loan types generally entail higher underwriting and other service costs and present greater credit risks than traditional residential mortgages. Commercial loans are secured by the assets of the business and, upon default, any collateral repossessed may not be sufficient to repay the outstanding loan balance. In addition, loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and, thus, are more likely to be affected by current economic conditions and adverse business developments. Commercial real estate properties tend to be unique and are more difficult to value than residential real estate properties. Commercial real estate loans may not be fully amortizing, meaning that they have a significant principal balance or “balloon” payment due at maturity. In addition, commercial real estate properties, particularly industrial and warehouse properties, are generally subject to relatively greater environmental risks than noncommercial properties and to the corresponding burdens and costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Also, there may be costs and delays involved in enforcing rights of a property owner against tenants in default under terms of leases with respect to commercial properties. For example, a tenant may seek protection under bankruptcy laws, which could result in termination of the tenant’s lease.ASB also has a national syndicated lending portfolio where ASB is a participant in credit facilities agented by established and reputable national lenders. Management selectively chooses each deal based on conservative credit criteria to ensure a high-quality, well diversified portfolio. In the event the borrower encounters financial difficulties and ASB is unable to sell its participation interest in the loan in the secondary market, ASB is typically reliant on the originating lender for managing any loan workout or foreclosure proceedings that may become necessary. Accordingly, ASB has less control over such proceedings than loans it originates and may be required to accommodate the interests of other participating lenders in resolving delinquencies or defaults on participated loans, which could result in outcomes that are not fully consistent with ASB’s preferred strategies. In addition, a significant proportion of ASB’s syndicated loans are originated in states other than Hawaii and are subject to the local regional and regulatory risks specific to those states.Similar to the national syndicated lending portfolio, ASB does not service commercial loans in which it has participation interests rather than being the lead or agent lender and is subject to the policies and practices of the agent lender, who is the loan servicer, in resolving delinquencies or defaults on participated loans.The consumer loan portfolio primarily consists of personal unsecured loans with risk-based pricing. Repayment is based on the borrower’s financial stability as these loans have no collateral and there is less assurance that ASB will be able to collect all payments due under these loans or have sufficient collateral to cover all outstanding loan balances.ASB’s allowance for loan losses may not cover actual loan losses. ASB’s allowance for loan losses is ASB’s estimate of probable losses inherent in its loan portfolio and is based on a continuing assessment of:•existing risks in the loan portfolio;•historical loss experience with ASB’s loans;•changes in collateral value; and•current conditions (for example, economic conditions, real estate market conditions and interest rate environment).27If ASB’s actual loan losses exceed its allowance for loan losses, it may incur losses, its financial condition may be materially and adversely affected, and additional capital may be required to enhance its capital position. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, regularly review the adequacy of ASB’s allowance. These agencies may require ASB to establish additional allowances based on their judgment of the information available at the time of their examinations. No assurance can be given that ASB will not sustain loan losses in excess of present or future levels of its allowance for loan losses"
6,HE,HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC INDS,2019-02-28,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSThe businesses of HEI and its subsidiaries involve numerous risks which, if realized, could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements. For additional information for certain risk factors enumerated below and other risks of the Company and its operations, see “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” above and HEI’s MD&A, HEI’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Hawaiian Electric’s MD&A and Hawaiian Electric’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”Holding company and company-wide risks.HEI is a holding company that derives its income from its operating subsidiaries and depends on the ability of those subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI and on its own ability to raise capital.  HEI is a legal entity separate and distinct from its various subsidiaries. As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, HEI’s cash flows and consequent ability to service its obligations and pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon its receipt of dividends or other distributions from its operating subsidiaries and its ability to issue common stock or other equity securities and to incur additional debt. The ability of HEI’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI, in turn, is subject to the risks associated with their operations and to contractual and regulatory restrictions, including:•the provisions of an HEI agreement with the PUC, which could limit the ability of HEI’s principal electric public utility subsidiary, Hawaiian Electric, to pay dividends to HEI in the event that the consolidated common stock equity of the Utilities falls below 35% of total capitalization of the electric utilities;•the provisions of an HEI agreement entered into with federal bank regulators in connection with its acquisition of its bank subsidiary, ASB, which require HEI to contribute additional capital to ASB (up to a maximum amount of additional capital of $28.3 million as of December 31, 2018 under the Regulatory Capital Maintenance/Dividend Agreement dated May 26, 1988, between HEI, HEIDI and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation) upon request of the regulators in order to maintain ASB’s regulatory capital at the level required by regulation;•the minimum capital and capital distribution regulations of the OCC that are applicable to ASB and capital regulations that become applicable to HEI and ASB Hawaii;•the receipt of a letter from the FRB communicating the OCC’s and FRB’s non-objection to the payment of any dividend ASB proposes to declare and pay to ASB Hawaii and HEI; and•the provisions of preferred stock resolutions and debt instruments of HEI and its subsidiaries.The Company, and its credit rating, is subject to risks associated with the Hawaii economy (in the aggregate and on an individual island basis), volatile U.S. capital markets and changes in the interest rate and credit market environment that have or could result in higher retirement benefit plan funding requirements, declines in ASB’s interest rate margins and investment values, higher delinquencies and charge-offs in ASB’s loan portfolio and restrictions on the ability of HEI or its subsidiaries to borrow money or issue securities.  The two largest components of Hawaii’s economy are tourism and the federal government (including the military). Because the core businesses of HEI’s subsidiaries are providing local public electric utility services (through Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries) and banking services (through ASB) in Hawaii, the Company’s operating results are significantly influenced by Hawaii’s economy, which in turn is influenced by economic conditions in the mainland U.S. (particularly California) and Asia (particularly Japan) as a result of the impact of those conditions on tourism, by the impact of interest rates on the construction and real estate industries and by the impact of federal government spending in Hawaii, which can be affected by world conditions and, from time to time, the expiration of federal government appropriations bills. HEI’s and Hawaiian Electric’s securities ratings only reflect the view, at the time the ratings are issued, of the applicable rating agency. There is no assurance that any such credit rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such rating will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agency if, in such rating agency’s judgment, circumstances, such as current, past or future effects or events so warrant. Any such lowering, suspension or withdrawal of any rating may have an adverse effect on the availability of capital to the Company or the market price or marketability of HEI’s and/or Hawaiian Electric’s securities, which could increase the cost of capital of HEI and Hawaiian Electric, and such increased costs, including interest charges, under HEI’s and/or Hawaiian Electric’s debt securities and credit facilities, would result in reductions in HEI’s consolidated net income in future periods. Further, if HEI’s or Hawaiian Electric’s commercial paper ratings were to be downgraded, HEI and Hawaiian Electric might not be able to sell commercial paper and might be required to draw on more expensive bank lines of credit or to defer capital or other expenditures. Neither HEI nor Hawaiian Electric management can predict future rating agency actions or their effects on the future cost of capital of HEI or Hawaiian Electric.17Changes in the U.S. capital markets can also have significant effects on the Company. For example, pension funding requirements are affected by the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for pension plans, and by the discount rate used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost and value obligations. The Utilities’ pension tracking mechanisms help moderate pension expense; however, the significant decline in 2008 in the value of the Company’s defined benefit pension plan assets resulted in a substantial gap between the projected benefit obligations under the plans and the value of plan assets, resulting in increases in funding requirements. The increases have moderated in recent years as investment performance has improved.Because the earnings of ASB depend primarily on net interest income, interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASB’s operations. HEI and the Utilities are also exposed to interest rate risk primarily due to their periodic borrowing requirements, the discount rate used to determine pension funding requirements and the possible effect of interest rates on the electric utilities’ rates of return. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors, including general economic conditions and the policies of government and regulatory authorities. HEI cannot predict future changes in interest rates, nor be certain that interest rate risk management strategies it or its subsidiaries have implemented will be successful in managing interest rate risk.Interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting the fair value of ASB’s investment securities. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair values of those instruments, respectively. Disruptions in the credit markets, a liquidity crisis in the banking industry or increased levels of residential mortgage delinquencies and defaults may result in decreases in the fair value of ASB’s investment securities and an impairment that is other-than-temporary, requiring ASB to write down its investment securities. As of December 31, 2018, ASB’s investment in U.S. Treasury, federal agency obligations, and mortgage-backed securities have an implicit guarantee from the U.S. government.HEI and Hawaiian Electric and their subsidiaries may incur higher retirement benefits expenses and have and will likely continue to recognize substantial liabilities for retirement benefits.  Retirement benefits expenses and cash funding requirements could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the performance of the U.S. equity markets, trends in interest rates and health care costs, plan amendments, mortality improvements, new laws relating to pension funding and changes in accounting principles. For the Utilities, however, retirement benefits expenses, as adjusted by the pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions (OPEB) tracking mechanisms, have been an allowable expense for rate-making purposes.The Company is subject to the risks associated with the geographic concentration of its businesses and current lack of interconnections that could result in service interruptions at the Utilities or higher default rates on loans held by ASB.  The business of the Utilities is concentrated on the individual islands they serve in the State of Hawaii. Their operations are more vulnerable to service interruptions than are many U.S. mainland utilities because none of the systems of the Utilities are interconnected with the systems on the other islands they serve. Because of this lack of interconnections, it is necessary to maintain higher generation reserve margins than are typical for U.S. mainland utilities to help ensure reliable service. Service interruptions, including in particular extended interruptions that could result from a natural disaster or terrorist activity, could adversely impact the revenues and costs of some or all of the Utilities.Substantially all of ASB’s consumer loan customers are Hawaii residents. A significant portion of the commercial loan customers are located in Hawaii. While a majority of customers are on Oahu, ASB also has customers on the neighbor islands (whose economies have been weaker than Oahu during the last economic downturn). Substantially all of the real estate underlying ASB’s residential and commercial real estate loans are located in Hawaii. These assets may be subject to a greater risk of default than other comparable assets held by financial institutions with other geographic concentrations in the event of adverse economic, political or business developments or natural disasters affecting Hawaii and the ability of ASB’s customers to make payments of principal and interest on their loans.Increasing competition and technological advances could cause HEI’s businesses to lose customers or render their operations obsolete.  The banking industry in Hawaii, and certain aspects of the electric utility industry, are competitive. The success of HEI’s subsidiaries in meeting competition and responding to technological advances will continue to have a direct impact on HEI’s consolidated financial performance. For example:•ASB, one of the largest financial institutions in the state, is in direct competition for deposits and loans not only with two larger institutions that have substantial capital, technology and marketing resources, but also with smaller Hawaii institutions and other U.S. institutions, including credit unions, mutual funds, mortgage brokers, finance companies and investment banking firms. Larger financial institutions may have greater access to capital at lower costs, which could impair ASB’s ability to compete effectively. New or significant advances in technology (e.g., significant advances in internet banking) could render the operations of ASB less competitive or obsolete. •The Utilities face competition from IPPs; customer self-generation, with or without cogeneration; customer energy storage; and the potential formation of community-based, cooperative ownership or municipality structures for 18electrical service on all islands it serves.  With the exception of certain identified projects, the Utilities are required to use competitive bidding to acquire a future generation resource unless the PUC finds competitive bidding to be unsuitable. The PUC set policies for distributed generation (DG) interconnection agreements and standby rates. The results of competitive bidding, competition from IPPs, customer self-generation, and potential cooperative ownership or municipality structures for electric utility service, and the rate at which technological developments facilitating nonutility generation of electricity, combined heat and power technology, off-grid microgrids, and customer energy storage may render the operations of the Utilities less competitive or outdated and adversely affect the Utilities and the results of their operations. The Company may be subject to information technology and operational system failures, network disruptions, cyber attacks and breaches in data security that could adversely affect its businesses and reputation. The Company and its subsidiaries rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed or hosted by third party service providers, to manage its business data, communications, and other business processes. Such information technology systems may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or other security incidents, which could result in unauthorized access to confidential data or disruptions to operations. If the Company is unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve an incident, it may have a material impact on the Company’s operations or business reputation.Utilities.  The Utilities rely on evolving and increasingly complex operational and information systems, networks and other technologies, which are interconnected with the systems and network infrastructure owned by third parties to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, invoicing and collection of payments, customer relationship management, human resource management, the acquisition, generation and delivery of electrical service to customers, and to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting and legal and tax requirements. The Utilities use their systems and infrastructure to create, collect, store, and process sensitive information, including personal information regarding customers, employees and their dependents, retirees, and other individuals. Despite the Utilities security measures, all of their systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access caused by natural disasters, cybersecurity incidents, security breaches, user error, unintentional defects created by system changes, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures or similar events.  Any such failure could have a material adverse impact on the Utilities ability to process transactions and provide service, as well the Utilities’ financial condition and results of operations. Further, a data breach involving theft, improper disclosure, or other unauthorized access to or acquisition of confidential information could subject the Utilities to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, claims by third parties, and enforcement actions by government agencies. It could also reduce the value of proprietary information, and harm the reputation of the Utilities.As noted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the utility industry is continuing to experience an increase in the frequency and sophistication of cybersecurity incidents. The Utilities’ systems have been, and will likely continue to be, a target of attacks. Further, the Utilities’ operational networks may be subject to new cybersecurity risks due to modernizing and interconnecting existing infrastructure with new technologies and control systems, including those owned by third parties.  Although the Utilities have not experienced a material cybersecurity breach to date, such incidents may occur and may have a material adverse effect on the Utilities in the future. In order to address cybersecurity risks to their information systems, the Utilities maintain security measures designed to protect their information technology systems, network infrastructure and other assets. The Utilities actively monitor developments in the area of cybersecurity and are involved in various related government and industry groups, and brief the Board quarterly on relevant cybersecurity issues. Although the Utilities continue to make investments in their cybersecurity program, including personnel, technologies, cyber insurance and training of Utilities personnel, there can be no assurance that these systems or their expected functionality will be implemented, maintained, or expanded effectively; nor can security measures completely eliminate the possibility of a cybersecurity breach. The Utility maintains cyber liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents. However, there is no guarantee that adequate insurance will continue to be available at rates the Utility believes are reasonable or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates. If the Utilities’ cybersecurity measures were to be breached, the Utilities could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to their reputation.Due to the size, scope and complexity of the Utilities’ business, the development and maintenance of information technology systems to process and track information is critical and challenging. The Utilities often rely on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems and these third-party vendors could cease to exist, fail to establish adequate processes to protect the Utilities systems and information, or experience internal or external security incidents. In addition, the Utilities are pursuing complex business transformation initiatives, which include establishing common processes across Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric and the upgrade or replacement of existing systems. Significant system changes increase the risk of system interruptions. Although the Utilities maintain change control processes to mitigate this risk, system interruptions may occur. Further, delay or failure to complete the integration of information systems and 19processes may result in delays in regulatory cost recovery, increased service interruptions of aging legacy systems, or the failure to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives.In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Utilities’ new ERP/EAM system was placed into service. Any failure in addressing issues in the stabilization of the ERP/EAM system implementation could adversely affect the Utilities’ ability to timely and accurately report financial information and make payments to vendors and employees. Additionally, one of the conditions imposed by the PUC’s approval of the system is the requirement that the Utilities achieve cost savings consistent with a minimum of $244 million in ERP/EAM project-related benefits to be delivered to customers over the system’s 12-year service life. If the Utilities are not able to achieve such minimum savings, the PUC could impose financial penalties, such as a reduction of revenue requirements that could adversely impact the Utilities’ results of operations and financial condition.The Utilities have disaster recovery plans in place to protect their businesses from information technology service interruptions. The disaster recovery plans, however, may not be successful in preventing the loss of customer data, service interruptions and disruptions to operations or damage to important facilities. If any of these systems fail to operate properly or becomes disabled and the Utilities’ disaster recovery plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, the Utilities could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to their reputations.ASB.  ASB is highly dependent on its ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions and relies heavily on communication and information systems, including those of third party vendors and other service providers. Communication and information system failures can result from a variety of risks including, but not limited to, events that are wholly or partially out of ASB’s control, such as communication line integrity, weather, terrorist acts, natural disasters, accidental disasters, unauthorized breaches of security systems, energy delivery systems, cyberattacks and other events.ASB is under continuous threat of loss due to cyberattacks, especially as ASB continues to expand customer capabilities to utilize the Internet and other remote channels to transact business. Two of the most significant cyberattack risks that ASB faces are e-fraud and loss of sensitive customer data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals extract funds directly from customers’ or ASB’s accounts using fraudulent schemes that may include Internet-based funds transfers. ASB has been subject to e-fraud incidents historically. Loss of sensitive customer data are attempts to steal sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, through unauthorized access to computer systems, including computer hacking. Such attacks are less frequent, but could present significant reputational, legal and regulatory costs if successful. Intrusion detection and prevention systems, anti-virus software, firewalls and other general information technology controls have been put in place to detect and prevent cyberattacks or information system breaches. A disaster recovery plan has been developed in the event of a natural disaster, security breach, military or terrorist action, power or communication failure or similar event. The disaster recovery plan, however, may not be successful in preventing the loss of customer data, service interruptions, disruptions to operations or damage to important facilities. Although ASB devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of ASB’s computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to ASB and its customers, there can be no assurance that such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately corrected by ASB or its vendors.If any of these systems fail to operate properly or become disabled even for a brief period of time, ASB could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to its reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on ASB’s financial condition and results of operations. HEI’s businesses could suffer losses that are uninsured due to a lack of affordable insurance coverage, unavailability of insurance coverage or limitations on the insurance coverage the Company does have.  In the ordinary course of business, HEI and its subsidiaries purchase insurance coverages (e.g., property and liability coverages) to protect against loss of, or damage to, their properties and against claims made by third parties and employees for property damage or personal injuries. However, the protection provided by such insurance is limited in significant respects and, in some instances, there is no coverage. Certain of the insurance has substantial deductibles or has limits on the maximum amounts that may be recovered. For example, the Utilities’ overhead and underground transmission and distribution systems (with the exception of substation buildings and contents) have a replacement value roughly estimated at $7 billion and are largely not insured against loss or damage because the amount of transmission and distribution system insurance available is limited and the premiums are cost prohibitive. Similarly, the Utilities have no business interruption insurance as the premiums for such insurance would be cost prohibitive, particularly since the Utilities are not interconnected to other systems. If a hurricane or other uninsured catastrophic natural disaster were to occur, and if the PUC were not to allow the affected Utilities to recover from ratepayers restoration costs and revenues lost from business interruption, the lost revenues and repair expenses could result in a significant decrease in HEI’s consolidated net income or in significant net losses for the affected periods.ASB generally does not obtain credit enhancements, such as mortgagor bankruptcy insurance, but does require standard hazard and hurricane insurance and may require flood insurance for certain properties. ASB is subject to the risks of borrower 20defaults and bankruptcies, special hazard losses not covered by the required insurance and the insurance company’s inability to pay claims on existing policies.Increased federal and state environmental regulation will require an increasing commitment of resources and funds and could result in construction delays or penalties and fines for non-compliance. HEI and its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, hazardous substances, waste management, natural resources and health and safety, which regulate, among other matters, the operation of existing facilities, the construction and operation of new facilities and the proper cleanup and disposal of hazardous and toxic wastes and substances. These laws and regulations could result in increased capital, operating, and other costs. HEI or its subsidiaries are currently involved in investigatory or remedial actions at current, former or third-party sites and there is no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs relating to these sites. In addition, compliance with these legal requirements requires the Utilities to commit significant resources and funds toward, among other things, environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment and payment of emission fees. These laws and regulations, among other things, require that certain environmental permits be obtained in order to construct or operate certain facilities, and obtaining such permits can entail significant expense and cause substantial construction delays. Also, these laws and regulations may be amended from time to time, including amendments that increase the burden and cost of compliance. For example, emission and/or discharge limits may be tightened, more extensive permitting requirements may be imposed and additional substances may become regulated. In addition, significant regulatory uncertainty exists regarding the impact of federal or state greenhouse gas (GHG) emission limits and reductions.If HEI or its subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond their control, that failure may result in civil or criminal penalties and fines or the cessation of operations. Adverse tax rulings or developments could result in significant increases in tax payments and/or expense.  Governmental taxing authorities could challenge a tax return position taken by HEI or its subsidiaries and, if the taxing authorities prevail, HEI’s consolidated tax payments and/or expense, including applicable penalties and interest, could increase significantly.The Company could be subject to the risk of uninsured losses in excess of its accruals for litigation matters.  HEI and its subsidiaries are involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of their businesses, most of which is covered by insurance (subject to policy limits and deductibles). However, other litigation may arise that is not routine or involves claims that may not be covered by insurance. Because of the uncertainties associated with litigation, there is a risk that litigation against HEI or its subsidiaries, even if vigorously defended, could result in costs of defense and judgment or settlement amounts not covered by insurance and in excess of reserves established in HEI’s consolidated financial statements.Changes in accounting principles and estimates could affect the reported amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities or revenues and expenses.  HEI’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Changes in accounting principles (including the possible adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards or new U.S. accounting standards), or changes in the Company’s application of existing accounting principles, could materially affect the financial statement presentation of HEI’s or the Utilities’ consolidated results of operations and/or financial condition. Further, in preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the amounts reported for electric utility revenues; allowance for loan losses; income taxes; investment securities, property, plant and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; derivatives; goodwill; pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; and contingencies and litigation.The Utilities’ financial statements reflect assets and costs based on cost-based rate-making regulations. Continued accounting in this manner requires that certain criteria relating to the recoverability of such costs through rates be met. If events or circumstances should change such that the criteria are no longer satisfied, the Utilities’ expect that their regulatory assets (amounting to $833 million as of December 31, 2018), net of regulatory liabilities (amounting to $950 million as of December 31, 2018), would be charged to the statement of income in the period of discontinuance. As a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act), the Utilities were required to adjust their deferred tax assets and liabilities for the lower federal income tax rate, resulting in excess accumulated deferred income tax balances (ADIT). To the extent the ADIT was related to items included in regulatory rate base or ratemaking, the related net excess ADIT was reclassified to a regulatory liability that will be returned to customers through rates. Changes in accounting principles can also impact HEI’s consolidated financial statements. For example, if management determines that a PPA requires the consolidation of the IPP in the financial statements, the consolidation could have a material effect on Hawaiian Electric’s and HEI’s consolidated financial statements, including the recognition of a significant amount of assets and liabilities and, if such a consolidated IPP were operating at a loss and had insufficient equity, the potential recognition of such losses. Also, the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), as amended, on January 1, 2019, had a 21significant impact on HEI’s consolidated balance sheet, resulting in the recognition of $257 million in lease liabilities ($215 million related to the Utilities’ PPAs) and $257 million in right-of-use assets. Changes in the accounting principles for expected credit losses were issued by the FASB to replace existing impairment models, including replacing an “incurred loss” model for loans with a “current expected credit loss” model based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The changes also require enhanced disclosures to help financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization’s portfolio. The Company plans to adopt the accounting principle changes in the first quarter of 2020 and has not yet determined the impact of the adoption. The new impairment model could have a material adverse impact on ASB’s results of operations.Electric utility risks.Actions of the PUC are outside the control of the Utilities and could result in inadequate or untimely rate increases, in rate reductions or refunds or in unanticipated delays, expenses or writedowns in connection with the construction of new projects.  The rates the Utilities are allowed to charge for their services and the timeliness of permitted rate increases are among the most important items influencing the Utilities’ results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The PUC has broad discretion over the rates that the Utilities charge their customers. As part of the decoupling mechanism that the Utilities have implemented, each of the Utilities will file a rate case once every three years. Any adverse decision by the PUC concerning the level or method of determining electric utility rates, the items and amounts that may be included in rate base, the returns on equity or rate base found to be reasonable, the potential consequences of exceeding or not meeting such returns, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding could have a material adverse effect on Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.To improve the timing and certainty of the recovery of their costs, the Utilities have proposed and/or received approval of various cost recovery mechanisms including an ECAC (replaced with the ECRCs for Hawaiian Electric and Hawaii Electric Light in 2019), a PPAC, and pension and OPEB tracking mechanisms, as well as a decoupling mechanism, a major project interim recovery (MPIR) adjustment mechanism, and a renewable energy infrastructure program (REIP) surcharge. A change in, or the elimination of, any of these cost recovery mechanisms, could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities.On April 18, 2018, the PUC issued an order, instituting a proceeding to investigate performance-based regulation (PBR). The PUC’s implementation of performance-based ratemaking for the Utilities pursuant to Act 005, Session Laws 2018, could include, but is not limited to, the potential addition of new performance incentive mechanisms, the adoption of third party proposals by the PUC in its implementation of PBR, and penalties for not achieving performance incentive goals. The impacts of the implementation of PBR cannot be predicted and these impacts could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities.The Utilities could be required to refund to their customers, with interest, revenues that have been or may be received under interim rate orders in their rate case proceedings and other proceedings, if and to the extent they exceed the amounts allowed in final orders.Many public utility projects require PUC approval and various permits (e.g., environmental and land use permits) from other governmental agencies. Difficulties in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, the necessary approvals or permits, or any adverse decision or policy made or adopted, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision, by an agency with respect to such approvals and permits, can result in significantly increased project costs or even cancellation of projects. In the event a project does not proceed, or if the PUC disallows cost recovery for all or part of a project, or if project costs exceed caps imposed by the PUC in its approval of the project, project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could result in significant reductions in Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated net income. Energy cost adjustment/recovery clauses. The rate schedules of each of the Utilities include ECACs (ECRCs for Hawaiian Electric and Hawaii Electric Light in 2019—see below) under which electric rates charged to customers are automatically adjusted for changes in the weighted-average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power, and the relative amounts of company-generated power and purchased power. ECAC/ECRCs are subject to periodic review by the PUC. In recent rate cases, the PUC has approved an additional trigger that would allow a re-establishment of fuel usage efficiency targets under certain conditions and annual automatic adjustments of fuel usage efficiency targets for all Utilities. In the most recent Hawaiian Electric rate case, the PUC ordered an ECRC for Hawaiian Electric, which recovers all fuel and purchased energy expenses, a portion of which had previously been recovered through base rates. The PUC also ordered a scaled down version of a fossil fuel risk sharing mechanism proposed by Blue Planet, which provides for a 98/2% risk-sharing split between ratepayers and Hawaiian Electric, of fossil fuel prices above or below a baseline price and the fuel usage efficiency pass-through within a range, with an annual maximum exposure cap of $2.5 million in either direction and which became effective January 1, 2019. The PUC also approved an expansion of the range of 22fuel efficiencies for low sulfur fuel oil and a full pass through to customers the costs of diesel fuel and biodiesel fuel that represent the balance of the generation fuel usage subject to the risk sharing split.  In Hawaii Electric Light’s 2016 test year rate case, the PUC approved an expansion of the range of diesel fuel usage efficiencies under which fuel cost would be fully passed through to customers that became effective October 1, 2018. In February 2019, Hawaii Electric Light replaced the ECAC with an ECRC, which recovers all fuel and purchased energy expenses, a portion which was previously recovered in base rates.In the interim decision and order in the Maui Electric 2018 test year rate case, the PUC approved the settlements between Maui Electric and the Consumer Advocate on the ECAC, which included retaining the existing range of fuel usage efficiencies at all three islands. The PUC will continue to examine Blue Planet’s proposed fossil fuel cost risk sharing mechanism, similar to what it proposed in the Hawaiian Electric 2017 test year rate case.  A final decision and order in the Maui Electric 2018 test year rate case is pending. See “Most recent rate proceedings” in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.A change in, or the elimination of, the ECAC/ECRC could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities.Electric utility operations are significantly influenced by weather conditions.  The Utilities’ results of operations can be affected by the weather and natural disasters. Weather conditions, particularly temperature and humidity, directly influence the demand for electricity. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, lava flows and lightning storms, some of which may become more severe or frequent as a result of global climate changes, can cause outages and property damage and require the Utilities to incur significant additional expenses that may not be recoverable.Electric utility operations may be significantly influenced by climate change.  While the timing, extent and ultimate effects of climate change cannot be determined with any certainty, climate change is predicted to result in sea level rise, which could potentially impact coastal and other low-lying areas (where much of the Utilities’ electric infrastructure is sited), and could cause erosion of beaches, saltwater intrusion into aquifers and surface ecosystems, higher water tables and increased flooding and storm damage due to heavy rainfall. The effects of climate change on the weather (for example, floods, hurricanes, heat waves or drought conditions, the latter of which could increase wildfire risk), sea levels, and water availability and quality, all have the potential to materially adversely affect the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities. For example, severe weather and its related impacts could cause significant harm to the Utilities’ physical facilities. Electric utility operations depend heavily on third-party suppliers of fuel and purchased power.  The Utilities rely on fuel  suppliers and shippers, and IPPs to deliver fuel and power, respectively, in accordance with contractual agreements. Approximately 70% of the net energy generated or purchased by the Utilities in 2018 was generated from the burning of fossil fuel oil, and purchases of power by the Utilities provided about 45% of their total net energy generated and purchased for the same period. Failure or delay by fuel suppliers and shippers to provide fuel pursuant to existing contracts, or failure by a major IPP to deliver the firm capacity anticipated in its PPA, could disrupt the ability of the Utilities to deliver electricity and require the Utilities to incur additional expenses to meet the needs of their customers that may not be recoverable. In addition, as the IPP contracts near the end of their terms, there may be less economic incentive for the IPPs to make investments in their units to ensure the availability of their units. Also, as these contractual agreements end, the Utilities may not be able to purchase fuel and power on terms equivalent to the current contractual agreements.The capacity provided by the Utilities’ generating resources and third-party purchased power may not be sufficient to meet customers’ energy requirements .  The Utilities rely upon their generating resources and purchased power from third parties to meet their customers’ energy requirements. The Utilities update their generation capacity evaluation each year to determine the Utilities’ ability to meet reasonably expected demands for service and provide reasonable reserves for emergencies. These evaluations are impacted by a variety of factors, including customer energy demand, energy conservation and efficiency initiatives, economic conditions, and weather patterns. If the capacity provided by the Utilities’ generating resources and third-party purchased power is not adequate relative to customer demand, the Utilities may have to contract to buy more power from third parties, invest in additional generating facilities over the long-term, or extend the operating life of existing utility units. Any failure to meet customer energy requirements could negatively impact the satisfaction of the Utilities’ customers, which could have an adverse impact on the Utilities’ business and results of operations. Electric utility generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated and/or increased operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs.  Operation of electric generating facilities involves certain risks which can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels. Included among these risks are facility shutdowns or power interruptions due to insufficient generation or a breakdown or failure of equipment or processes. In addition, operations could be negatively impacted by interruptions in fuel supply, inability to negotiate satisfactory collective bargaining agreements when existing agreements expire or other labor disputes, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements, disruptions in delivery of electricity, operator error and catastrophic events such 23as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, fires, explosions, floods or other similar occurrences affecting the Utilities’ generating facilities or transmission and distribution systems.The Utilities may be adversely affected by new legislation or administrative actions.  Congress, the Hawaii legislature and governmental agencies periodically consider legislation and other initiatives that could have uncertain or negative effects on the Utilities and their customers. Congress, the Hawaii legislature and governmental agencies have adopted, or are considering adopting, a number of measures that will significantly affect the Utilities, as described below.Renewable Portfolio Standards law.  In 2015, Hawaii’s RPS law was amended to require electric utilities to meet an RPS of 15%, 30%, 40%, 70% and 100% by December 31, 2015, 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2045 respectively. Energy savings resulting from energy efficiency programs do not count toward the RPS after 2014. The Utilities are committed to achieving these goals and met the 2015 RPS; however, due to the exclusion of energy savings in calculating RPS after 2014 and risks such as potential delays in IPPs being able to deliver contracted renewable energy, it is possible the Utilities may not attain the required renewable percentages in the future, and management cannot predict the future consequences of failure to do so (including potential penalties to be assessed by the PUC). On December 19, 2008, the PUC approved a penalty of $20 for every MWh that an electric utility is deficient under Hawaii’s RPS law. The PUC noted, however, that this penalty may be reduced, in the PUC’s discretion, due to events or circumstances that are outside an electric utility’s reasonable control, to the extent the event or circumstance could not be reasonably foreseen and ameliorated, as described in the RPS law and in an RPS framework adopted by the PUC. In addition, the PUC ordered that the Utilities will be prohibited from recovering any RPS penalty costs through rates.Renewable energy.  In 2007, a measure was passed by the Hawaii legislature stating that the PUC may consider the need for increased renewable energy in rendering decisions on utility matters. Due to this measure, it is possible that, if energy from a renewable source is more expensive than energy from fossil fuel, the PUC may still approve the purchase of energy from the renewable source, resulting in higher costs.Global climate change and greenhouse gas emissions reduction.  National and international concern about climate change and the contribution of GHG emissions (including carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels) to climate change have led to federal legislative and regulatory proposals and action by the state of Hawaii to reduce GHG emissions. In July 2007, the State Legislature passed Act 234, which requires a statewide reduction of GHG emissions by January 1, 2020 to levels at or below the statewide GHG emission levels in 1990. On June 20, 2014, the Governor signed the final rules required to implement Act 234 and these rules went into effect on June 30, 2014. In general, Act 234 and the GHG rule require affected sources that have the potential to emit GHGs in excess of established thresholds to reduce their GHG emissions by 16% below 2010 emission levels by 2020. In accordance with State requirements, the Utilities submitted an Emissions Reduction Plan (EmRP) to the DOH on June 30, 2015. The Utilities submitted a revised EmRP on October 15, 2018, to reflect the partnership established between the Utilities and several IPPs. In this plan, the partnership has committed to a 16% reduction in GHG emissions in accordance with the rule. The Utilities have taken, and continue to identify opportunities to take, direct action to reduce GHG emissions from their operations, including, but not limited to, supporting demand-side management programs that foster energy efficiency, using renewable resources for energy production and purchasing power from IPPs generated by renewable resources, and burning renewable biodiesel at selected Hawaiian Electric and Maui Electric generating units. On April 24, 2018, Act 005, Session Laws 2018 was signed into law, which establishes performance metrics that the PUC shall consider while establishing performance incentives and penalty mechanisms under a performance-based ratemaking model. The law requires that the PUC establish these performance-based ratemaking mechanisms on or before January 1, 2020. The PUC opened a proceeding on April 18, 2018.The foregoing legislation or legislation that now is, or may in the future be, proposed present risks and uncertainties for the Utilities.The Utilities may be subject to increased operational challenges and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely impacted in meeting the commitments and objectives of clean energy initiatives and Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS).  The far-reaching nature of the Utilities’ renewable energy commitments and the RPS goals present risks to the Company. Among such risks are: (1) the dependence on third-party suppliers of renewable purchased energy, which if the Utilities are unsuccessful in negotiating purchased power agreements with such IPPs or if a major IPP fails to deliver the anticipated capacity and/or energy in its purchased power agreement, could impact the Utilities’ achievement of their commitments to RPS goals and/or the Utilities’ ability to deliver reliable service; (2) delays in acquiring or unavailability of non-fossil fuel supplies for renewable generation; (3) the impact of intermittent power to the electrical grid and reliability of service if appropriate supporting infrastructure is not installed or does not operate effectively; (4) the likelihood that the Utilities 24may need to make substantial investments in related infrastructure, which could result in increased borrowings and, therefore, materially impact the financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities; and (5) the commitment to support a variety of initiatives, which, if approved by the PUC, may have a material impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the Utilities depending on their design and implementation. These initiatives include, but are not limited to, programs to enable more customer-sited generation (but studying distributed generation interconnections on a per-circuit basis). The implementation of these or other programs may adversely impact the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities.Bank risks.Fluctuations in interest rates could result in lower net interest income, impair ASB’s ability to originate new loans or impair the ability of ASB’s adjustable-rate borrowers to make increased payments or cause such borrowers to repay their adjustable-rate loans.  Interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASB’s operations. ASB’s net interest income consists primarily of interest income received on fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, mortgage-backed securities and investments, less interest expense consisting primarily of interest paid on deposits and other borrowings. Interest rate risk arises when earning assets mature or when their interest rates change in a time frame different from that of the costing liabilities. Changes in market interest rates, including changes in the relationship between short-term and long-term market interest rates or between different interest rate indices, can impact ASB’s net interest margin. See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.” Although ASB pursues an asset-liability management strategy designed to mitigate its risk from changes in market interest rates, unfavorable movements in interest rates could result in lower net interest income. Residential 1-4 family fixed-rate mortgage loans comprised about 41% of ASB’s loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018 and do not re-price with movements in interest rates. ASB continues to face a challenging interest rate environment. The Federal Open Market Committee increased the federal funds rate in 2016, 2017 and 2018, which has caused the yield curve to flatten. Increases in market interest rates could have an adverse impact on ASB’s cost of funds. Higher market interest rates could lead to higher interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Significant increases in market interest rates, or the perception that an increase may occur, could adversely affect ASB’s ability to originate new loans and grow. An increase in market interest rates, especially a sudden increase, could also adversely affect the ability of ASB’s adjustable-rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations. If this occurred, it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets and charge-offs. Conversely, a decrease in interest rates or a mismatching of maturities of interest sensitive financial instruments could result in an acceleration in the prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities and impact ASB’s ability to reinvest its liquidity in similar yielding assets.Changes in the method for determining London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the potential replacement of LIBOR may affect our loan portfolio and interest income on loans. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether or not LIBOR will cease to exist at that time or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee composed of large U.S. financial institutions, announced replacement of U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by U.S. Treasury securities called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The potential effect of the elimination of LIBOR on ASB’s LIBOR-indexed loan portfolio and interest income on loans cannot yet be determined.ASB’s operations are affected by factors that are beyond its control, that could result in lower revenues, higher expenses or decreased demand for its products and services.  ASB’s results of operations depend primarily on the income generated by the supply of and demand for its products and services, which primarily consist of loans and deposit services. ASB’s revenues and expenses may be adversely affected by various factors, including:•local, regional, national and other economic and political conditions that could result in declines in employment and real estate values, which in turn could adversely affect the ability of borrowers to make loan payments and the ability of ASB to recover the full amounts owing to it under defaulted loans;•the ability of borrowers to obtain insurance and the ability of ASB to place insurance where borrowers fail to do so, particularly in the event of catastrophic damage to collateral securing loans made by ASB;•faster than expected loan prepayments that can cause an acceleration of the amortization of premiums on loans and investments and the impairment of mortgage servicing assets of ASB;•changes in ASB’s loan portfolio credit profiles and asset quality, which may increase or decrease the required level of allowance for loan losses;•technological disruptions affecting ASB’s operations or financial or operational difficulties experienced by any outside vendor on whom ASB relies to provide key components of its business operations, such as business processing, network access or internet connections;•events of default and foreclosure of loans whereby ASB becomes the owner of a mortgage properties that presents environmental risk or potential clean up liability;25•the impact of legislative and regulatory changes, including changes affecting capital requirements, increasing oversight of and reporting by banks, or affecting the lending programs or other business activities of ASB;•additional legislative changes regulating the assessment of overdraft, interchange and credit card fees, which can have a negative impact on noninterest income;•public opinion about ASB and financial institutions in general, which, if negative, could impact the public’s trust and confidence in ASB and adversely affect ASB’s ability to attract and retain customers and expose ASB to adverse legal and regulatory consequences;•increases in operating costs (including employee compensation expense and benefits and regulatory compliance costs), inflation and other factors, that exceed increases in ASB’s net interest, fee and other income; and•the ability of ASB to maintain or increase the level of deposits, ASB’s lowest costing funds.Banking and related regulations could result in significant restrictions being imposed on ASB’s business or in a requirement that HEI divest ASB.  ASB is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the Department of Treasury, the OCC and the FDIC, and is subject to reserve requirements established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In addition, the FRB is responsible for regulating ASB’s holding companies, HEI and ASB Hawaii. The regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies to address not only ASB’s compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations, but also capital adequacy, asset quality, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity and various other factors.Under certain circumstances, including any determination that ASB’s relationship with HEI results in an unsafe and unsound banking practice, these regulatory authorities have the authority to restrict the ability of ASB to transfer assets and to make distributions to its shareholders (including payment of dividends to HEI), or they could seek to require HEI to sever its relationship with or divest its ownership of ASB. Payment by ASB of dividends to HEI may also be restricted by the OCC and FRB under its prompt corrective action regulations or its capital distribution regulations if ASB’s capital position deteriorates. In order to maintain its status as a QTL, ASB is required to maintain at least 65% of its assets in “qualified thrift investments.” Institutions that fail to maintain QTL status are subject to various penalties, including limitations on their activities. In ASB’s case, the activities of HEI and HEI’s other subsidiaries would also be subject to restrictions, and a failure or inability to comply with those restrictions could effectively result in the required divestiture of ASB. Federal legislation has also been proposed in the past that could operate to eliminate the thrift charter or the grandfathered status of HEI as a unitary thrift holding company, which in turn would result in a required divestiture of ASB. In the event of a required divestiture, federal law substantially limits the types of entities that could potentially acquire ASB.Recent legislative and regulatory initiatives could have an adverse effect on ASB’s business.  The Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July 2010, has had a substantial impact on the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes a framework through which regulatory reform will be written and changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies could affect HEI and ASB in substantial and unpredictable ways. A major component of the Dodd-Frank Act is the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that has the responsibility for setting and enforcing clear, consistent rules relating to consumer financial products and services and has the authority to prohibit practices it finds to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. Compliance with any such directives could have adverse effects on ASB’s revenues or operating costs. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on ASB’s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.A large percentage of ASB’s loans and securities are collateralized by real estate, and adverse changes in the real estate market and/or general economic or other conditions may result in loan losses and adversely affect the Company’s profitability.  As of December 31, 2018 approximately 82% of ASB’s loan portfolio was comprised of loans primarily collateralized by real estate, most of which was concentrated in the State of Hawaii. During 2018, ASB’s HELOC and residential 1-4 family portfolios grew by 7% and 1%, respectively, and now comprise 78% of total real estate loans. ASB’s financial results may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions, either nationally or in the state of Hawaii, including decreases in real estate values, adverse employment conditions, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal and state government and other significant external events. Adverse changes in the economy may have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans. A deterioration of the economic environment in Hawaii, including a material decline in the real estate market, further declines in home resales, a material external shock, or any environmental clean-up obligation, may also significantly impair the value of ASB’s collateral and ASB’s ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. In the event of a default, amounts received upon sale of the collateral may be insufficient to recover outstanding principal and interest. In addition, if poor economic conditions result in decreased demand for real estate loans, ASB’s profits may decrease if its alternative investments earn less income than real estate loans.Expanding commercial, commercial real estate and consumer lending activities may result in higher costs and greater credit risk than residential lending activities due to the unique characteristics of these markets.  ASB had been aggressively pursuing a strategy that included expanding its commercial, commercial real estate and consumer lines of business. If ASB 26elects to pursue commercial and commercial real estate loans in the future, such loans have a higher risk profile than residential loans. Though both commercial and commercial real estate loans have shorter terms and earn higher spreads than residential mortgage loans, these loan types generally entail higher underwriting and other service costs and present greater credit risks than traditional residential mortgages. Commercial loans are secured by the assets of the business and, upon default, any collateral repossessed may not be sufficient to repay the outstanding loan balance. In addition, loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and, thus, are more likely to be affected by current economic conditions and adverse business developments. Commercial real estate properties tend to be unique and are more difficult to value than residential real estate properties. Commercial real estate loans may not be fully amortizing, meaning that they have a significant principal balance or “balloon” payment due at maturity. In addition, commercial real estate properties, particularly industrial and warehouse properties, are generally subject to relatively greater environmental risks than noncommercial properties and to the corresponding burdens and costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Also, there may be costs and delays involved in enforcing rights of a property owner against tenants in default under terms of leases with respect to commercial properties. For example, a tenant may seek protection under bankruptcy laws, which could result in termination of the tenant’s lease.ASB also has a national syndicated lending portfolio where ASB is a participant in credit facilities agented by established and reputable national lenders. Management selectively chooses each deal based on conservative credit criteria to ensure a high-quality, well diversified portfolio. In the event the borrower encounters financial difficulties and ASB is unable to sell its participation interest in the loan in the secondary market, the bank is typically reliant on the originating lender for managing any loan workout or foreclosure proceedings that may become necessary. Accordingly, ASB has less control over such proceedings than loans it originates and may be required to accommodate the interests of other participating lenders in resolving delinquencies or defaults on participated loans, which could result in outcomes that are not fully consistent with ASB’s preferred strategies. In addition, a significant proportion of ASB’s syndicated loans are originated in states other than Hawaii and are subject to the local regional and regulatory risks specific to those states.Similar to the national syndicated lending portfolio, ASB does not service commercial loans in which it has participation interests rather than being the lead or agent lender and is subject to the policies and practices of the agent lender, who is the loan servicer, in resolving delinquencies or defaults on participated loans.The consumer loan portfolio primarily consists of personal unsecured loans with risk-based pricing. Repayment is based on the borrower’s financial stability as these loans have no collateral and there is less assurance that ASB will be able to collect all payments due under these loans or have sufficient collateral to cover all outstanding loan balances.ASB’s allowance for loan losses may not cover actual loan losses. ASB’s allowance for loan losses is the bank’s estimate of probable losses inherent in its loan portfolio and is based on a continuing assessment of:•existing risks in the loan portfolio;•historical loss experience with ASB’s loans;•changes in collateral value; and•current conditions (for example, economic conditions, real estate market conditions and interest rate environment).If ASB’s actual loan losses exceed its allowance for loan losses, it may incur losses, its financial condition may be materially and adversely affected, and additional capital may be required to enhance its capital position. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, regularly review the adequacy of ASB’s allowance. These agencies may require ASB to establish additional allowances based on their judgment of the information available at the time of their examinations. No assurance can be given that ASB will not sustain loan losses in excess of present or future levels of its allowance for loan losses.The Tax Act may impact the financial services industry with respect to the marketability of residential loans and home equity indebtedness. The Tax Act limits the deduction available for mortgage interest by reducing the amount of debt that can be treated as acquisition indebtedness from the current level of $1 million to $750,000. The Tax Act also suspends the deduction for interest on home equity indebtedness. The impact of these tax law changes on residential mortgage and home equity line of credit loan production cannot yet be determined"
1,HE,HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC INDS,2018-03-01,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSThe businesses of HEI and its subsidiaries involve numerous risks which, if realized, could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements. For additional information for certain risk factors enumerated below and other risks of the Company and its operations, see “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” above and HEI’s 26MD&A, HEI’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk”, the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Hawaiian Electric’s MD&A and Hawaiian Electric’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”Holding Company and Company-Wide Risks.HEI is a holding company that derives its income from its operating subsidiaries and depends on the ability of those subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI and on its own ability to raise capital.  HEI is a legal entity separate and distinct from its various subsidiaries. As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, HEI’s cash flows and consequent ability to service its obligations and pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon its receipt of dividends or other distributions from its operating subsidiaries and its ability to issue common stock or other equity securities and to incur additional debt. The ability of HEI’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI, in turn, is subject to the risks associated with their operations and to contractual and regulatory restrictions, including:•the provisions of an HEI agreement with the PUC, which could limit the ability of HEI’s principal electric public utility subsidiary, Hawaiian Electric, to pay dividends to HEI in the event that the consolidated common stock equity of the Utilities falls below 35% of total capitalization of the electric utilities;•the provisions of an HEI agreement entered into with federal bank regulators in connection with its acquisition of its bank subsidiary, ASB, which require HEI to contribute additional capital to ASB (up to a maximum amount of additional capital of $28.3 million as of December 31, 2017) upon request of the regulators in order to maintain ASB’s regulatory capital at the level required by regulation;•the minimum capital and capital distribution regulations of the OCC that are applicable to ASB and capital regulations that become applicable to HEI and ASB Hawaii;•the receipt of a letter from the FRB communicating to the OCC and FRB's non-objection to the payment of any dividend ASB proposes to declare and pay to ASB Hawaii and HEI; and•the provisions of preferred stock resolutions and debt instruments of HEI and its subsidiaries.The Company is subject to risks associated with the Hawaii economy (in the aggregate and on an individual island basis), volatile U.S. capital markets and changes in the interest rate and credit market environment that have and/or could result in higher retirement benefit plan funding requirements, declines in ASB’s interest rate margins and investment values, higher delinquencies and charge-offs in ASB’s loan portfolio and restrictions on the ability of HEI or its subsidiaries to borrow money or issue securities.  The two largest components of Hawaii’s economy are tourism and the federal government (including the military). Because the core businesses of HEI’s subsidiaries are providing local public electric utility services (through Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries) and banking services (through ASB) in Hawaii, the Company’s operating results are significantly influenced by Hawaii’s economy, which in turn is influenced by economic conditions in the mainland U.S. (particularly California) and Asia (particularly Japan) as a result of the impact of those conditions on tourism, by the impact of interest rates on the construction and real estate industries and by the impact of world conditions on federal government spending in Hawaii. If Fitch, Moody's or S&P were to downgrade HEI’s or Hawaiian Electric’s long-term debt ratings because of past adverse effects, or if future events were to adversely affect the availability of capital to the Company, HEI’s and Hawaiian Electric’s ability to borrow and raise capital could be constrained and their future borrowing costs would likely increase with resulting reductions in HEI’s consolidated net income in future periods. Further, if HEI’s or Hawaiian Electric’s commercial paper ratings were to be downgraded, HEI and Hawaiian Electric might not be able to sell commercial paper and might be required to draw on more expensive bank lines of credit or to defer capital or other expenditures.Changes in the U.S. capital markets can also have significant effects on the Company. For example, pension funding requirements are affected by the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for pension plans, and by the discount rate used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost and value obligations. The Utilities’ pension tracking mechanisms help moderate pension expense; however, the significant decline in 2008 in the value of the Company’s defined benefit pension plan assets resulted in a substantial gap between the projected benefit obligations under the plans and the value of plan assets, resulting in increases in funding requirements. The increases have moderated in recent years as investment performance has improved.Because the earnings of ASB depend primarily on net interest income, interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASB’s operations. HEI and the Utilities are also exposed to interest rate risk primarily due to their periodic borrowing requirements, the discount rate used to determine pension funding requirements and the possible effect of interest rates on the electric utilities’ rates of return. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors, including general economic conditions and the policies of government and regulatory authorities. HEI cannot predict future changes in interest rates, nor be certain that interest rate risk management strategies it or its subsidiaries have implemented will be successful in managing interest rate risk.27Interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting the fair value of ASB’s investment securities. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair values of those instruments, respectively. Disruptions in the credit markets, a liquidity crisis in the banking industry or increased levels of residential mortgage delinquencies and defaults may result in decreases in the fair value of ASB’s investment securities and an impairment that is other-than-temporary, requiring ASB to write down its investment securities. As of December 31, 2017, ASB’s investment in U.S. Treasury, federal agency obligations, and mortgage-related securities have an implicit guarantee from the U.S. government.HEI and Hawaiian Electric and their subsidiaries may incur higher retirement benefits expenses and have and will likely continue to recognize substantial liabilities for retirement benefits.  Retirement benefits expenses and cash funding requirements could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the U.S. equity markets, trends in interest rates and health care costs, plan amendments, new laws relating to pension funding and changes in accounting principles. For the Utilities, however, retirement benefits expenses, as adjusted by the pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions (OPEB) tracking mechanisms, have been an allowable expense for rate-making purposes.The Company is subject to the risks associated with the geographic concentration of its businesses and current lack of interconnections that could result in service interruptions at the Utilities or higher default rates on loans held by ASB.  The business of the Utilities is concentrated on the individual islands they serve in the State of Hawaii. Their operations are more vulnerable to service interruptions than are many U.S. mainland utilities because none of the systems of the Utilities are interconnected with the systems on the other islands they serve. Because of this lack of interconnections, it is necessary to maintain higher generation reserve margins than are typical for U.S. mainland utilities to help ensure reliable service. Service interruptions, including in particular extended interruptions that could result from a natural disaster or terrorist activity, could adversely impact the KWH sales of some or all of the Utilities.Substantially all of ASB’s consumer loan customers are Hawaii residents. A significant portion of the commercial loan customers are located in Hawaii. While a majority of customers are on Oahu, ASB also has customers on the neighbor islands (whose economies have been weaker than Oahu during the recent economic downturn). Substantially all of the real estate underlying ASB’s residential and commercial real estate loans are located in Hawaii. These assets may be subject to a greater risk of default than other comparable assets held by financial institutions with other geographic concentrations in the event of adverse economic, political or business developments or natural disasters affecting Hawaii and the ability of ASB’s customers to make payments of principal and interest on their loans.Increasing competition and technological advances could cause HEI’s businesses to lose customers or render their operations obsolete.  The banking industry in Hawaii, and certain aspects of the electric utility industry, are competitive. The success of HEI’s subsidiaries in meeting competition and responding to technological advances will continue to have a direct impact on HEI’s consolidated financial performance. For example:•ASB, one of the largest financial institutions in the state, is in direct competition for deposits and loans not only with two larger institutions that have substantial capital, technology and marketing resources, but also with smaller Hawaii institutions and other U.S. institutions, including credit unions, mutual funds, mortgage brokers, finance companies and investment banking firms. Larger financial institutions may have greater access to capital at lower costs, which could impair ASB’s ability to compete effectively. Significant advances in technology could render the operations of ASB less competitive or obsolete.•The Utilities face competition from IPPs; customer self-generation, with or without cogeneration; customer energy storage; and the potential formation of community-based, cooperative ownership or municipality structures for electrical service on all islands it serves.  With the exception of certain identified projects, the Utilities are required to use competitive bidding to acquire a future generation resource unless the PUC finds competitive bidding to be unsuitable. The PUC set policies for distributed generation (DG) interconnection agreements and standby rates. The results of competitive bidding, competition from IPPs, customer self-generation, and potential cooperative ownership or municipality structures for electric utility service, and the rate at which technological developments facilitating nonutility generation of electricity, combined heat and power technology, off-grid microgrids, and customer energy storage may adversely affect the Utilities and the results of their operations. •New technological developments, such as the commercial development of energy storage and microgrids, may render the operations of the Utilities less competitive or outdated.The Company may be subject to information technology and operational system failures, network disruptions, cyber attacks and breaches in data security that could adversely affect its businesses and reputation.  Utilities.  The Utilities rely on evolving and increasingly complex operational and information systems, networks and other technologies, which are interconnected with the systems and network infrastructure owned by third parties to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, invoicing and collection of payments, customer relationship management, human resource management, the acquisition, generation and delivery of electrical service 28to customers, and to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting and legal and tax requirements. The Utilities use their systems and infrastructure to create, collect, store, and process sensitive information, including personal information regarding customers, employees and their dependents, retirees, and other individuals.  Despite the Utilities security measures, all of their systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access caused by natural disasters, cyber security incidents, security breaches, user error, unintentional defects created by system changes, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures or similar events.  Any such failure could have a material adverse impact on the Utilities ability to process transactions and provide service, as well the Utilities’ financial condition and results of operations.  Further, a data breach involving theft, improper disclosure, or other unauthorized access to or acquisition of confidential information could subject the Utilities to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, claims by third parties, and enforcement actions by government agencies. It could also reduce the value of proprietary information, and harm the reputation of the Utilities.As noted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the utility industry is continuing to experience an increase in the frequency and sophistication of cyber security incidents. The Utilities’ systems have been, and will likely continue to be, a target of attacks. Further, the Utilities’ operational networks may be subject to new cyber security risks due to modernizing and interconnecting existing infrastructure with new technologies and control systems, including those owned by third parties.  Although the Utilities have not experienced a material cyber security breach to date, such incidents may occur and may have a material adverse effect on the Utilities in the future. In order to address cyber security risks to their information systems, the Utilities maintain security measures designed to protect their information technology systems, network infrastructure and other assets. The Utilities actively monitor developments in the area of cyber security and are involved in various related government and industry groups, and brief the Board quarterly on relevant cyber security issues. Although the Utilities continue to make investments in their cyber security program, including personnel, technologies, cyber insurance and training of Utilities personnel, there can be no assurance that these systems or their expected functionality will be implemented, maintained, or expanded effectively; nor can security measures completely eliminate the possibility of a cyber security breach. The Utility maintains cyber liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents. However, there is no guarantee that adequate insurance will continue to be available at rates the Utility believes are reasonable or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates. If the Utilities’ cyber security measures were to be breached, the Utilities could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to their reputation.Due to the size, scope and complexity of the Utilities’ business, the development and maintenance of information technology systems to process and track information is critical and challenging.  The Utilities often rely on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems and these third-party vendors could cease to exist, fail to establish adequate processes to protect the Utilities systems and information, or experience internal or external security incidents.  In addition, the Utilities are pursuing complex business transformation initiatives, which include establishing common processes across Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric and the upgrade or replacement of existing systems. Significant system changes increase the risk of system interruptions. Although the Utilities maintain change control processes to mitigate this risk, system interruptions may occur. Further, delay or failure to complete the integration of information systems and processes may result in delays in regulatory cost recovery, increased service interruptions of aging legacy systems, or the failure to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives.The Utilities are in the process of replacing their existing ERP system. Although the Utilities have in place measures, including redundant systems and recovery capabilities to mitigate system interruptions to their systems, until the new system is put into service the Utilities face elevated operational risk from reliance on old and no longer fully supported software, including the possibility of increased frequency, duration and impact of interruptions.The Utilities have disaster recovery plans in place to protect their businesses from information technology service interruptions. The disaster recovery plans, however, may not be successful in preventing the loss of customer data, service interruptions and disruptions to operations or damage to important facilities. If any of these systems fail to operate properly or becomes disabled and the Utilities’ disaster recovery plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, the Utilities could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to their reputations.ASB.  ASB is highly dependent on its ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions and relies heavily on communication and information systems, including those of third party vendors and other service providers. Communication and information system failures can result from a variety of risks including, but not limited to, events that are wholly or partially out of ASB’s control, such as communication line integrity, weather, terrorist acts, natural disasters, accidental disasters, unauthorized breaches of security systems, energy delivery systems, cyber-attacks and other events.ASB is under continuous threat of loss due to cyber-attacks, especially as ASB continues to expand customer capabilities to utilize the Internet and other remote channels to transact business. Two of the most significant cyber-attack risks that ASB faces are e-fraud and loss of sensitive customer data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals extract funds directly from 29customers’ or ASB's accounts using fraudulent schemes that may include Internet-based funds transfers. ASB has been subject to e-fraud incidents historically. Loss of sensitive customer data are attempts to steal sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, through unauthorized access to computer systems, including computer hacking. Such attacks are less frequent, but could present significant reputational, legal and regulatory costs if successful. Intrusion detection and prevention systems, anti-virus software, firewalls and other general information technology controls have been put in place to detect and prevent cyber-attacks or information system breaches. A disaster recovery plan has been developed in the event of a natural disaster, security breach, military or terrorist action, power or communication failure or similar event. The disaster recovery plan, however, may not be successful in preventing the loss of customer data, service interruptions, disruptions to operations or damage to important facilities. Although ASB devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of ASB’s computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to ASB and its customers, there can be no assurance that such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately corrected by ASB or its vendors.To date, ASB has not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, but there can be no assurance that ASB will not suffer such losses in the future. If any of these systems fail to operate properly or become disabled even for a brief period of time, ASB could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to its reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on ASB’s financial condition and results of operations. HEI’s businesses could suffer losses that are uninsured due to a lack of affordable insurance coverage, unavailability of insurance coverage or limitations on the insurance coverage the Company does have.  In the ordinary course of business, HEI and its subsidiaries purchase insurance coverages (e.g., property and liability coverages) to protect against loss of, or damage to, their properties and against claims made by third parties and employees for property damage or personal injuries. However, the protection provided by such insurance is limited in significant respects and, in some instances, there is no coverage. Certain of the insurance has substantial deductibles or has limits on the maximum amounts that may be recovered. For example, the Utilities’ overhead and underground transmission and distribution systems (with the exception of substation buildings and contents) have a replacement value roughly estimated at $7 billion and are largely not insured against loss or damage because the amount of transmission and distribution system insurance available is limited and the premiums are cost prohibitive. Similarly, the Utilities have no business interruption insurance as the premiums for such insurance would be cost prohibitive, particularly since the Utilities are not interconnected to other systems. If a hurricane or other uninsured catastrophic natural disaster were to occur, and if the PUC were not to allow the affected Utilities to recover from ratepayers restoration costs and revenues lost from business interruption, the lost revenues and repair expenses could result in a significant decrease in HEI’s consolidated net income or in significant net losses for the affected periods.ASB generally does not obtain credit enhancements, such as mortgagor bankruptcy insurance, but does require standard hazard and hurricane insurance and may require flood insurance for certain properties. ASB is subject to the risks of borrower defaults and bankruptcies, special hazard losses not covered by the required insurance and the insurance company’s inability to pay claims on existing policies.Increased federal and state environmental regulation will require an increasing commitment of resources and funds and could result in construction delays or penalties and fines for non-compliance. HEI and its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, hazardous substances, waste management, natural resources and health and safety, which regulate, among other matters, the operation of existing facilities, the construction and operation of new facilities and the proper cleanup and disposal of hazardous and toxic wastes and substances. HEI or its subsidiaries are currently involved in investigatory or remedial actions at current, former or third-party sites and there is no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs relating to these sites. In addition, compliance with these legal requirements requires the Utilities to commit significant resources and funds toward, among other things, environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment and payment of emission fees. These laws and regulations, among other things, require that certain environmental permits be obtained in order to construct or operate certain facilities, and obtaining such permits can entail significant expense and cause substantial construction delays. Also, these laws and regulations may be amended from time to time, including amendments that increase the burden and expense of compliance. For example, emission and/or discharge limits may be tightened, more extensive permitting requirements may be imposed and additional substances may become regulated. In addition, significant regulatory uncertainty exists regarding the impact of federal or state greenhouse gas (GHG) emission limits and reductions.If HEI or its subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond their control, that failure may result in civil or criminal penalties and fines or the cessation of operations.30Adverse tax rulings or developments could result in significant increases in tax payments and/or expense.  Governmental taxing authorities could challenge a tax return position taken by HEI or its subsidiaries and, if the taxing authorities prevail, HEI’s consolidated tax payments and/or expense, including applicable penalties and interest, could increase significantly.The Company could be subject to the risk of uninsured losses in excess of its accruals for litigation matters.  HEI and its subsidiaries are involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of their businesses, most of which is covered by insurance (subject to policy limits and deductibles). However, other litigation may arise that is not routine or involves claims that may not be covered by insurance. Because of the uncertainties associated with litigation, there is a risk that litigation against HEI or its subsidiaries, even if vigorously defended, could result in costs of defense and judgment or settlement amounts not covered by insurance and in excess of reserves established in HEI’s consolidated financial statements.Changes in accounting principles and estimates could affect the reported amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities or revenues and expenses.  HEI’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Changes in accounting principles (including the possible adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards or new U.S. accounting standards), or changes in the Company’s application of existing accounting principles, could materially affect the financial statement presentation of HEI’s or the Utilities’ consolidated results of operations and/or financial condition. Further, in preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the amounts reported for electric utility revenues; allowance for loan losses; income taxes; investment securities, property, plant and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; derivatives; goodwill; pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; and contingencies and litigation.The Utilities' financial statements reflect assets and costs based on cost-based rate-making regulations. Continued accounting in this manner requires that certain criteria relating to the recoverability of such costs through rates be met. If events or circumstances should change so that the criteria are no longer satisfied, the Utilities’ expect that their regulatory assets (amounting to $869 million as of December 31, 2017), net of regulatory liabilities (amounting to $881 million as of December 31, 2017), would be charged to the statement of income in the period of discontinuance. As a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act), the Utilities were required to adjust their deferred tax assets and liabilities for the lower federal income tax rate, resulting in excess accumulated deferred income tax balances (ADIT). To the extent the ADIT was related to items included in regulatory rate base or ratemaking, the related net excess ADIT ($285 million) was reclassified to a regulatory liability that will be returned to customers through rates. The rate of the return to customers will be determined with the approval of the PUC.Changes in accounting principles can also impact HEI’s consolidated financial statements. For example, if management determines that a PPA requires the consolidation of the IPP in the financial statements, the consolidation could have a material effect on Hawaiian Electric’s and HEI’s consolidated financial statements, including the recognition of a significant amount of assets and liabilities and, if such a consolidated IPP were operating at a loss and had insufficient equity, the potential recognition of such losses. Also, if management determines that a PPA requires the classification of the agreement as a capital lease, a material effect on HEI’s consolidated balance sheet may result, including the recognition of significant capital assets and lease obligations.Changes in the accounting principles for expected credit losses were issued by the FASB to replace existing impairment models, including replacing an “incurred loss” model for loans with a “current expected credit loss” model based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The changes also require enhanced disclosures to help financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization’s portfolio. The Company plans to adopt the accounting principle changes in the first quarter of 2020 and has not yet determined the impact of the adoption. The new impairment model could have a material adverse impact on ASB’s results of operations.Electric Utility Risks.Actions of the PUC are outside the control of the Utilities and could result in inadequate or untimely rate increases, in rate reductions or refunds or in unanticipated delays, expenses or writedowns in connection with the construction of new projects.  The rates the Utilities are allowed to charge for their services and the timeliness of permitted rate increases are among the most important items influencing the Utilities’ results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The PUC has broad discretion over the rates that the Utilities charge their customers. As part of the decoupling mechanism that the Utilities have implemented, each of the Utilities will file a rate case once every three years. Any adverse decision by the PUC concerning the level or method of determining electric utility rates, the items and amounts that may be included in rate base, the returns on equity or rate base found to be reasonable, the potential consequences of exceeding or not meeting such returns, or any 31prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding could have a material adverse effect on Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.To improve the timing and certainty of the recovery of their costs, the Utilities have proposed and/or received approval of various cost recovery mechanisms including an ECAC, a PPAC, and pension and OPEB tracking mechanisms, as well as a decoupling mechanism, a major project interim recovery (MPIR) adjustment mechanism, and a renewable energy infrastructure program (REIP) surcharge. A change in, or the elimination of, any of these cost recovery mechanisms, including in the current proceeding in which the PUC is examining the decoupling mechanism, could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities.The Utilities could be required to refund to their customers, with interest, revenues that have been or may be received under interim rate orders in their rate case proceedings and other proceedings, if and to the extent they exceed the amounts allowed in final orders.Many public utility projects require PUC approval and various permits (e.g., environmental and land use permits) from other governmental agencies. Difficulties in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, the necessary approvals or permits, or any adverse decision or policy made or adopted, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision, by an agency with respect to such approvals and permits, can result in significantly increased project costs or even cancellation of projects. In the event a project does not proceed, or if the PUC disallows cost recovery for all or part of a project, or if project costs exceed caps imposed by the PUC in its approval of the project, project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could result in significant reductions in Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated net income. For example, in January 2013, the Utilities and the Consumer Advocate signed a settlement agreement to write off $40 million of costs in lieu of conducting PUC-ordered regulatory audits of the CIP CT-1 and the CIS projects. Energy cost adjustment clauses. The rate schedules of each of the Utilities include ECACs under which electric rates charged to customers are automatically adjusted for changes in the weighted-average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power, and the relative amounts of company-generated power and purchased power.ECACs are subject to periodic review by the PUC. In the most recent rate cases, the PUC allowed the current ECAC to continue. In the decoupling reexamination proceeding in 2014 through 2016, the PUC considered potential modifications to the ECAC. In April 2017, the PUC issued an order in the decoupling reexamination proceeding acknowledging the complex issues relating to changing the ECAC mechanisms and indicating it will consider these issues in the Utilities’ pending rate cases.All of the Utilities have proposed modifications to their respective ECAC provisions in their open rate cases. Hawaii Electric Light has proposed an expansion of the range of fuel usage efficiencies under which fuel costs would be fully passed through to customers. Hawaiian Electric has also proposed such an expansion of the range of fuel efficiencies for low sulfur fuel oil, which accounts for about 97% of its generation fuel usage, and has proposed to fully pass through to customers the costs of diesel fuel and biodiesel fuel that represent the balance of the generation fuel usage.  Maui Electric has proposed to retain the existing range of fuel usage efficiencies at all three islands.  All of the Utilities have proposed an additional trigger that would allow a re-establishment of fuel usage efficiency targets under certain conditions. Blue Planet Foundation, a party to the Hawaiian Electric rate case has recommended allowing only a partial pass-through of fuel costs with a sharing of cost above or below the allowed levels. See ""Most recent rate proceedings"" in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.A change in, or the elimination of, the ECAC could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities.Electric utility operations are significantly influenced by weather conditions.  The Utilities’ results of operations can be affected by the weather. Weather conditions, particularly temperature and humidity, directly influence the demand for electricity. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis and lightning storms, which may become more severe or frequent as a result of global climate changes, can cause outages and property damage and require the Utilities to incur significant additional expenses that may not be recoverable.Electric utility operations may be significantly influenced by climate change.  While the timing, extent and ultimate effects of climate change cannot be determined with any certainty, climate change is predicted to result in sea level rise, which could potentially impact coastal and other low-lying areas (where much of the Utilities’ electric infrastructure is sited), and could cause erosion of beaches, saltwater intrusion into aquifers and surface ecosystems, higher water tables and increased flooding and storm damage due to heavy rainfall. The effects of climate change on the weather (for example, floods or hurricanes), sea levels, and water availability and quality have the potential to materially adversely affect the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities. For example, severe weather could cause significant harm to the Utilities’ physical facilities. Electric utility operations depend heavily on third-party suppliers of fuel and purchased power.  The Utilities rely on fuel oil suppliers and shippers and IPPs to deliver fuel oil and power, respectively, in accordance with contractual agreements. Approximately 69% of the net energy generated or purchased by the Utilities in 2017 was generated from the burning of fossil 32fuel oil, and purchases of power by the Utilities provided about 46% of their total net energy generated and purchased for the same period. Failure or delay by oil suppliers and shippers to provide fuel pursuant to existing contracts, or failure by a major IPP to deliver the firm capacity anticipated in its PPA, could disrupt the ability of the Utilities to deliver electricity and require the Utilities to incur additional expenses to meet the needs of their customers that may not be recoverable. In addition, as the IPP contracts near the end of their terms, there may be less economic incentive for the IPPs to make investments in their units to ensure the availability of their units. Also, as these contractual agreements end, the Utilities may not be able to purchase fuel and power on terms equivalent to the current contractual agreements.Electric utility generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated and/or increased operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs.  Operation of electric generating facilities involves certain risks which can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels. Included among these risks are facility shutdowns or power interruptions due to insufficient generation or a breakdown or failure of equipment or processes. In addition, operations could be negatively impacted by interruptions in fuel supply, inability to negotiate satisfactory collective bargaining agreements when existing agreements expire or other labor disputes, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements, disruptions in delivery of electricity, operator error and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, fires, explosions, floods or other similar occurrences affecting the Utilities’ generating facilities or transmission and distribution systems.The Utilities may be adversely affected by new legislation or administrative actions.  Congress, the Hawaii legislature and governmental agencies periodically consider legislation and other initiatives that could have uncertain or negative effects on the Utilities and their customers. Congress, the Hawaii legislature and governmental agencies have adopted, or are considering adopting, a number of measures that will significantly affect the Utilities, as described below.Renewable Portfolio Standards law.  In 2015, Hawaii’s RPS law was amended to require electric utilities to meet an RPS of 15%, 30%, 40%, 70% and 100% by December 31, 2015, 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2045 respectively. Energy savings resulting from energy efficiency programs do not count toward the RPS after 2014. The Utilities are committed to achieving these goals and met the 2015 RPS; however, due to the exclusion of energy savings in calculating RPS after 2014 and risks such as potential delays in IPPs being able to deliver contracted renewable energy, it is possible the Utilities may not attain the required renewable percentages in the future, and management cannot predict the future consequences of failure to do so (including potential penalties to be assessed by the PUC). On December 19, 2008, the PUC approved a penalty of $20 for every MWh that an electric utility is deficient under Hawaii’s RPS law. The PUC noted, however, that this penalty may be reduced, in the PUC’s discretion, due to events or circumstances that are outside an electric utility’s reasonable control, to the extent the event or circumstance could not be reasonably foreseen and ameliorated, as described in the RPS law and in an RPS framework adopted by the PUC. In addition, the PUC ordered that the Utilities will be prohibited from recovering any RPS penalty costs through rates.Renewable energy.  In 2007, a measure was passed by the Hawaii legislature stating that the PUC may consider the need for increased renewable energy in rendering decisions on utility matters. Due to this measure, it is possible that, if energy from a renewable source is more expensive than energy from fossil fuel, the PUC may still approve the purchase of energy from the renewable source, resulting in higher costs.Global climate change and greenhouse gas emissions reduction.  National and international concern about climate change and the contribution of GHG emissions (including carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels) to climate change have led to federal legislative and regulatory proposals and action by the state of Hawaii to reduce GHG emissions. In July 2007, the State Legislature passed Act 234, which requires a statewide reduction of GHG emissions by January 1, 2020 to levels at or below the statewide GHG emission levels in 1990. On June 20, 2014, the Governor signed the final rules required to implement Act 234 and these rules went into effect on June 30, 2014. In general, Act 234 and the GHG rule require affected sources that have the potential to emit GHGs in excess of established thresholds to reduce their GHG emissions by 16% below 2010 emission levels by 2020. In accordance with State requirements, the Utilities submitted an Emissions Reduction Plan (EmRP) to the DOH on June 30, 2015. Hawaiian Electric, Maui Electric, and Hawaii Electric Light have a total of 11 facilities affected by the state GHG rule. Hawaiian Electric made use of the partnering provisions in the GHG rule to prepare one EmRP for all 11 of the Utilities’ affected facilities. In this plan, the Utilities have committed to a 16% reduction in GHG emissions company-wide. Pursuant to the State’s GHG rule, the DOH will incorporate the proposed facility-specific GHG emission limits into each facility’s covered source permit based on the 2020 levels specified in Hawaiian Electric’s EmRP. The State GHG rule requires affected sources to pay an annual fee that is based on tons per year of GHG emissions. The Utilities’ GHG emissions fee is approximately $0.5 million annually. The latest assessment of the proposed federal and final state GHG rules is that the continued growth in renewable power generation will significantly reduce the compliance costs and risk for the Utilities.33On June 3, 2010, the EPA’s final GHG Tailoring Rule was published. It created a new threshold for GHG emissions from new and existing facilities and required certain facilities to obtain Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V operating permits. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld that the EPA can apply the Best Available Control Technology (BACT) requirement to GHG for new or modified sources that trigger PSD permitting for air pollutants other than GHG. Any Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light, and Maui Electric new or modified emission sources that trigger PSD permitting will be required to comply with BACT requirements. On August 26, 2016, the EPA proposed revisions to the PSD and Title V permitting regulations to fully implement the 2014 U.S. Supreme Court decision including the establishment of a threshold below which BACT is not required for GHG emissions for new or modified emission sources that trigger PSD permitting.The Utilities have taken, and continue to identify opportunities to take, direct action to reduce GHG emissions from their operations, including, but not limited to, supporting DSM programs that foster energy efficiency, using renewable resources for energy production and purchasing power from IPPs generated by renewable resources, burning renewable biodiesel in Hawaiian Electric’s CIP CT-1, using biodiesel for startup and shutdown of selected Maui Electric generating units, and testing biofuel blends in other Hawaiian Electric and Maui Electric generating units. The foregoing legislation or legislation that now is, or may in the future be, proposed present risks and uncertainties for the Utilities.The Utilities may be subject to increased operational challenges and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely impacted in meeting the commitments and objectives of clean energy initiatives and Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS).  The far-reaching nature of the Utilities' renewable energy commitments and the RPS goals present risks to the Company. Among such risks are: (1) the dependence on third party suppliers of renewable purchased energy, which if the Utilities are unsuccessful in negotiating purchased power agreements with such IPPs or if a major IPP fails to deliver the anticipated capacity in its purchased power agreement, could impact the Utilities’ achievement of their commitments to RPS goals and/or the Utilities’ ability to deliver reliable service; (2) delays in acquiring or unavailability of non-fossil fuel supplies for renewable generation; (3) the impact of intermittent power to the electrical grid and reliability of service if appropriate supporting infrastructure is not installed or does not operate effectively; (4) the likelihood that the Utilities may need to make substantial investments in related infrastructure, which could result in increased borrowings and, therefore, materially impact the financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities; and (5) the commitment to support a variety of initiatives, which, if approved by the PUC, may have a material impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the Utilities depending on their design and implementation. Bank Risks.Fluctuations in interest rates could result in lower net interest income, impair ASB’s ability to originate new loans or impair the ability of ASB’s adjustable-rate borrowers to make increased payments or cause such borrowers to repay their adjustable-rate loans.  Interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASB’s operations. ASB’s net interest income consists primarily of interest income received on fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, mortgage-related securities and investments, less interest expense consisting primarily of interest paid on deposits and other borrowings. Interest rate risk arises when earning assets mature or when their interest rates change in a time frame different from that of the costing liabilities. Changes in market interest rates, including changes in the relationship between short-term and long-term market interest rates or between different interest rate indices, can impact ASB’s net interest margin.Although ASB pursues an asset-liability management strategy designed to mitigate its risk from changes in market interest rates, unfavorable movements in interest rates could result in lower net interest income. Residential 1-4 family fixed-rate mortgage loans comprised about 42% of ASB’s loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017 and do not re-price with movements in interest rates. ASB continues to face a challenging interest rate environment. The Federal Open Market Committee increased the federal funds rate in 2016 and 2017, which has caused the yield curve to flatten. Increases in market interest rates could have an adverse impact on ASB’s cost of funds. Higher market interest rates could lead to higher interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Significant increases in market interest rates, or the perception that an increase may occur, could adversely affect ASB’s ability to originate new loans and grow. An increase in market interest rates, especially a sudden increase, could also adversely affect the ability of ASB’s adjustable-rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations. If this occurred, it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets and charge-offs. Conversely, a decrease in interest rates or a mismatching of maturities of interest sensitive financial instruments could result in an acceleration in the prepayment of loans and mortgage-related securities and impact ASB’s ability to reinvest its liquidity in similar yielding assets.Changes in the method for determining LIBOR and the potential replacement of LIBOR may affect our loan portfolio and interest income on loans. As a result of concerns about the accuracy of the calculation of the benchmark London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), a number of British Bankers’ Association (BBA) member banks entered into settlements with regulators and law enforcement agencies with respect to the alleged manipulation of LIBOR. Actions by the BBA, regulators or law enforcement agencies, as a result of these or future events, may result in changes to the manner in which LIBOR is determined. 34Potential changes, or uncertainty related to such potential changes may adversely affect the market for loans with LIBOR-indexed interest rates. In addition, changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR. The head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced a desire to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. The potential effect of such an event on our LIBOR-indexed loan portfolio and interest income on loans cannot yet be determined. ASB’s operations are affected by factors that are beyond its control, that could result in lower revenues, higher expenses or decreased demand for its products and services.  ASB’s results of operations depend primarily on the income generated by the supply of and demand for its products and services, which primarily consist of loans and deposit services. ASB’s revenues and expenses may be adversely affected by various factors, including:•local, regional, national and other economic and political conditions that could result in declines in employment and real estate values, which in turn could adversely affect the ability of borrowers to make loan payments and the ability of ASB to recover the full amounts owing to it under defaulted loans;•the ability of borrowers to obtain insurance and the ability of ASB to place insurance where borrowers fail to do so, particularly in the event of catastrophic damage to collateral securing loans made by ASB;•faster than expected loan prepayments that can cause an acceleration of the amortization of premiums on loans and investments and the impairment of mortgage servicing assets of ASB;•changes in ASB’s loan portfolio credit profiles and asset quality, which may increase or decrease the required level of allowance for loan losses;•technological disruptions affecting ASB’s operations or financial or operational difficulties experienced by any outside vendor on whom ASB relies to provide key components of its business operations, such as business processing, network access or internet connections;•the impact of legislative and regulatory changes, including changes affecting capital requirements, increasing oversight of and reporting by banks, or affecting the lending programs or other business activities of ASB;•additional legislative changes regulating the assessment of overdraft, interchange and credit card fees, which can have a negative impact on noninterest income;•public opinion about ASB and financial institutions in general, which, if negative, could impact the public’s trust and confidence in ASB and adversely affect ASB’s ability to attract and retain customers and expose ASB to adverse legal and regulatory consequences;•increases in operating costs (including employee compensation expense and benefits and regulatory compliance costs), inflation and other factors, that exceed increases in ASB’s net interest, fee and other income; and•the ability of ASB to maintain or increase the level of deposits, ASB’s lowest costing funds.Banking and related regulations could result in significant restrictions being imposed on ASB’s business or in a requirement that HEI divest ASB.  ASB is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the Department of Treasury, the OCC and the FDIC, and is subject to reserve requirements established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In addition, the FRB is responsible for regulating ASB’s holding companies, HEI and ASB Hawaii. The regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies to address not only ASB’s compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations, but also capital adequacy, asset quality, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity and various other factors.Under certain circumstances, including any determination that ASB’s relationship with HEI results in an unsafe and unsound banking practice, these regulatory authorities have the authority to restrict the ability of ASB to transfer assets and to make distributions to its shareholders (including payment of dividends to HEI), or they could seek to require HEI to sever its relationship with or divest its ownership of ASB. Payment by ASB of dividends to HEI may also be restricted by the OCC and FRB under its prompt corrective action regulations or its capital distribution regulations if ASB’s capital position deteriorates. In order to maintain its status as a QTL, ASB is required to maintain at least 65% of its assets in “qualified thrift investments.” Institutions that fail to maintain QTL status are subject to various penalties, including limitations on their activities. In ASB’s case, the activities of HEI and HEI’s other subsidiaries would also be subject to restrictions, and a failure or inability to comply with those restrictions could effectively result in the required divestiture of ASB. Federal legislation has also been proposed in the past that could result in a required divestiture of ASB. In the event of a required divestiture, federal law substantially limits the types of entities that could potentially acquire ASB.Recent legislative and regulatory initiatives could have an adverse effect on ASB’s business.  The Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July 2010, has had a substantial impact on the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes a framework through which regulatory reform will be written and changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies could affect HEI and ASB in substantial and unpredictable ways. A major component of the Dodd-Frank Act is the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that has the responsibility for setting and enforcing clear, consistent rules relating to consumer financial products and services and has the authority to prohibit practices it finds to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. Compliance with any such directives could have adverse effects on ASB’s revenues or operating costs. Failure to comply with 35laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on ASB’s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.A large percentage of ASB’s loans and securities are collateralized by real estate, and adverse changes in the real estate market and/or general economic or other conditions may result in loan losses and adversely affect the Company’s profitability.  As of December 31, 2017 approximately 84% of ASB’s loan portfolio was comprised of loans primarily collateralized by real estate, most of which was concentrated in the State of Hawaii. During 2017, ASB's HELOC and residential 1-4 family portfolios grew by 6% and 3%, respectively, and now comprise 78% of total real estate loans. ASB’s financial results may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions, either nationally or in the state of Hawaii, including decreases in real estate values, adverse employment conditions, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal and state government and other significant external events. Adverse changes in the economy may have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans. A deterioration of the economic environment in Hawaii, including a material decline in the real estate market, further declines in home resales, a material external shock, or any environmental clean-up obligation, may also significantly impair the value of ASB’s collateral and ASB’s ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. In the event of a default, amounts received upon sale of the collateral may be insufficient to recover outstanding principal and interest. In addition, if poor economic conditions result in decreased demand for real estate loans, ASB’s profits may decrease if its alternative investments earn less income than real estate loans.Expanding commercial, commercial real estate and consumer lending activities may result in higher costs and greater credit risk than residential lending activities due to the unique characteristics of these markets.  ASB had been aggressively pursuing a strategy that included expanding its commercial, commercial real estate and consumer lines of business. If ASB elects to pursue commercial and commercial real estate loans in the future, such loans have a higher risk profile than residential loans. Though both commercial and commercial real estate loans have shorter terms and earn higher spreads than residential mortgage loans, these loan types generally entail higher underwriting and other service costs and present greater credit risks than traditional residential mortgages. Commercial loans are secured by the assets of the business and, upon default, any collateral repossessed may not be sufficient to repay the outstanding loan balance. In addition, loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and, thus, are more likely to be affected by current economic conditions and adverse business developments. Commercial real estate properties tend to be unique and are more difficult to value than residential real estate properties. Commercial real estate loans may not be fully amortizing, meaning that they have a significant principal balance or “balloon” payment due at maturity. In addition, commercial real estate properties, particularly industrial and warehouse properties, are generally subject to relatively greater environmental risks than noncommercial properties and to the corresponding burdens and costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Also, there may be costs and delays involved in enforcing rights of a property owner against tenants in default under terms of leases with respect to commercial properties. For example, a tenant may seek protection under bankruptcy laws, which could result in termination of the tenant’s lease.ASB also has a national syndicated lending portfolio where ASB is a participant in credit facilities agented by established and reputable national lenders. Management selectively chooses each deal based on conservative credit criteria to ensure a high quality, well diversified portfolio. In the event the borrower encounters financial difficulties and ASB is unable to sell its participation interest in the loan in the secondary market, the bank is typically reliant on the originating lender for managing any loan workout or foreclosure proceedings that may become necessary. Accordingly, ASB has less control over such proceedings than loans it originates and may be required to accommodate the interests of other participating lenders in resolving delinquencies or defaults on participated loans, which could result in outcomes that are not fully consistent with ASB's preferred strategies. In addition, a significant proportion of ASB's syndicated loans are originated in states other than Hawaii, and are subject to the local regional and regulatory risks specific to those states.Similar to the national syndicated lending portfolio, ASB does not service commercial loans in which it has participation interests rather than being the lead or agent lender and is subject to the policies and practices of the agent lender, who is the loan servicer, in resolving delinquencies or defaults on participated loans.The consumer loan portfolio primarily consists of personal unsecured loans as ASB began offering a personal loan product with risk-based pricing. Repayment is based on the borrower’s financial stability as these loans have no collateral and there is less assurance that ASB will be able to collect all payments due under these loans or have sufficient collateral to cover all outstanding loan balances.ASB's allowance for loan losses may not cover actual loan losses. ASB's allowance for loan losses is the bank's estimate of probable losses inherent in its loan portfolio and is based on a continuing assessment of:•existing risks in the loan portfolio;•historical loss experience with ASB's loans;•changes in collateral value; and36•current conditions (for example, economic conditions, real estate market conditions and interest rate environment).If ASB's actual loan losses exceed its allowance for loan losses, it may incur losses, its financial condition may be materially and adversely affected and additional capital may be required to enhance its capital position. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, regularly review the adequacy of ASB's allowance. These agencies may require ASB to establish additional allowances based on their judgment of the information available at the time of their examinations. No assurance can be given that ASB will not sustain loan losses in excess of present or future levels of its allowance for loan losses.The Tax Act may impact the financial services industry with respect to the marketability of residential loans and home equity indebtedness. The Tax Act limits the deduction available for mortgage interest by reducing the amount of debt that can be treated as acquisition indebtedness from the current level of $1 million to $750,000. The new law also suspends the deduction for interest on home equity indebtedness. The impact of these tax law changes on residential mortgage and home equity line of credit loan production cannot yet be determined"
3,HE,HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC INDS,2017-02-24,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSThe businesses of HEI and its subsidiaries involve numerous risks which, if realized, could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements. For additional information for certain risk factors enumerated below and other risks of the Company and its operations, see “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” above and HEI’s MD&A, HEI’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk”, the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Hawaiian Electric’s MD&A, Hawaiian Electric’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”Holding Company and Company-Wide Risks.HEI is a holding company that derives its income from its operating subsidiaries and depends on the ability of those subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI and on its own ability to raise capital.  HEI is a legal entity separate and distinct from its various subsidiaries. As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, HEI’s cash flows and consequent ability to service its obligations and pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon its receipt of dividends or other distributions from its operating subsidiaries and its ability to issue common stock or other equity securities and to incur additional debt. The ability of HEI’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI, in turn, is subject to the risks associated with their operations and to contractual and regulatory restrictions, including:•the provisions of an HEI agreement with the PUC, which could limit the ability of HEI’s principal electric public utility subsidiary, Hawaiian Electric, to pay dividends to HEI in the event that the consolidated common stock equity of the Utilities falls below 35% of total capitalization of the electric utilities;•the provisions of an HEI agreement entered into with federal bank regulators in connection with its acquisition of its bank subsidiary, ASB, which require HEI to contribute additional capital to ASB (up to a maximum amount of additional capital of $28.3 million as of December 31, 2016) upon request of the regulators in order to maintain ASB’s regulatory capital at the level required by regulation;•the minimum capital and capital distribution regulations of the OCC that are applicable to ASB and capital regulations that become applicable to HEI and ASB Hawaii;•the receipt of a letter from the FRB communicating to the OCC and FRB's non-objection to the payment of any dividend ASB proposes to declare and pay to ASB Hawaii and HEI; and•the provisions of preferred stock resolutions and debt instruments of HEI and its subsidiaries.The Company is subject to risks associated with the Hawaii economy (in the aggregate and on an individual island basis), volatile U.S. capital markets and changes in the interest rate and credit market environment that have and/or could result in 25higher retirement benefit plan funding requirements, declines in ASB’s interest rate margins and investment values, higher delinquencies and charge-offs in ASB’s loan portfolio and restrictions on the ability of HEI or its subsidiaries to borrow money or issue securities.  The two largest components of Hawaii’s economy are tourism and the federal government (including the military). Because the core businesses of HEI’s subsidiaries are providing local public electric utility services (through Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries) and banking services (through ASB) in Hawaii, the Company’s operating results are significantly influenced by Hawaii’s economy, which in turn is influenced by economic conditions in the mainland U.S. (particularly California) and Asia (particularly Japan) as a result of the impact of those conditions on tourism, by the impact of interest rates on the construction and real estate industries and by the impact of world conditions (e.g., U.S. withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan) on federal government spending in Hawaii. For example, the turmoil in the financial markets and declines in the national and global economies had a negative effect on the Hawaii economy in 2009. In 2009, declines in the Hawaii, U.S. and Asian economies in part led to declines in HEI's share price, an increase in uncollected billings of the Utilities, higher delinquencies in ASB’s loan portfolio, declines in the Company's pension plan asset values and other adverse effects on HEI’s businesses.If Fitch, Moody's or S&P were to downgrade HEI’s or Hawaiian Electric’s long-term debt ratings because of past adverse effects, or if future events were to adversely affect the availability of capital to the Company, HEI’s and Hawaiian Electric’s ability to borrow and raise capital could be constrained and their future borrowing costs would likely increase with resulting reductions in HEI’s consolidated net income in future periods. Further, if HEI’s or Hawaiian Electric’s commercial paper ratings were to be downgraded, HEI and Hawaiian Electric might not be able to sell commercial paper and might be required to draw on more expensive bank lines of credit or to defer capital or other expenditures.Changes in the U.S. capital markets can also have significant effects on the Company. For example, pension funding requirements are affected by the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for pension plans, and by the discount rate used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost and value obligations. The Utilities’ pension tracking mechanisms help moderate pension expense; however, the significant decline in 2008 in the value of the Company’s defined benefit pension plan assets resulted in a substantial gap between the projected benefit obligations under the plans and the value of plan assets, resulting in increases in funding requirements. The increases have moderated in recent years as investment performance has improved.Because the earnings of ASB depend primarily on net interest income, interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASB’s operations. HEI and the Utilities are also exposed to interest rate risk primarily due to their periodic borrowing requirements, the discount rate used to determine pension funding requirements and the possible effect of interest rates on the electric utilities’ rates of return. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors, including general economic conditions and the policies of government and regulatory authorities. HEI cannot predict future changes in interest rates, nor be certain that interest rate risk management strategies it or its subsidiaries have implemented will be successful in managing interest rate risk.Interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting the fair value of ASB’s investment securities. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair values of those instruments, respectively. Disruptions in the credit markets, a liquidity crisis in the banking industry or increased levels of residential mortgage delinquencies and defaults may result in decreases in the fair value of ASB’s investment securities and an impairment that is other-than-temporary, requiring ASB to write down its investment securities. As of December 31, 2016, ASB’s investment in U.S. Treasury, federal agency obligations, and mortgage-related securities have an implicit guarantee from the U.S. government.HEI and Hawaiian Electric and their subsidiaries may incur higher retirement benefits expenses and have and will likely continue to recognize substantial liabilities for retirement benefits.  Retirement benefits expenses and cash funding requirements could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the U.S. equity markets, trends in interest rates and health care costs, plan amendments, new laws relating to pension funding and changes in accounting principles. For the Utilities, however, retirement benefits expenses, as adjusted by the pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions (OPEB) tracking mechanisms, have been an allowable expense for rate-making purposes.The Company is subject to the risks associated with the geographic concentration of its businesses and current lack of interconnections that could result in service interruptions at the Utilities or higher default rates on loans held by ASB.  The business of the Utilities is concentrated on the individual islands they serve in the State of Hawaii. Their operations are more vulnerable to service interruptions than are many U.S. mainland utilities because none of the systems of the Utilities are interconnected with the systems on the other islands they serve. Because of this lack of interconnections, it is necessary to maintain higher generation reserve margins than are typical for U.S. mainland utilities to help ensure reliable service. Service interruptions, including in particular extended interruptions that could result from a natural disaster or terrorist activity, could adversely impact the KWH sales of some or all of the Utilities.26Substantially all of ASB’s consumer loan customers are Hawaii residents. A significant portion of the commercial loan customers are located in Hawaii. While a majority of customers are on Oahu, ASB also has customers on the neighbor islands (whose economies have been weaker than Oahu during the recent economic downturn). Substantially all of the real estate underlying ASB’s residential and commercial real estate loans are located in Hawaii. These assets may be subject to a greater risk of default than other comparable assets held by financial institutions with other geographic concentrations in the event of adverse economic, political or business developments or natural disasters affecting Hawaii and the ability of ASB’s customers to make payments of principal and interest on their loans.Increasing competition and technological advances could cause HEI’s businesses to lose customers or render their operations obsolete.  The banking industry in Hawaii, and certain aspects of the electric utility industry, are competitive. The success of HEI’s subsidiaries in meeting competition and responding to technological advances will continue to have a direct impact on HEI’s consolidated financial performance. For example:•ASB, one of the largest financial institutions in the state, is in direct competition for deposits and loans not only with two larger institutions that have substantial capital, technology and marketing resources, but also with smaller Hawaii institutions and other U.S. institutions, including credit unions, mutual funds, mortgage brokers, finance companies and investment banking firms. Larger financial institutions may have greater access to capital at lower costs, which could impair ASB’s ability to compete effectively. Significant advances in technology could render the operations of ASB less competitive or obsolete.•The Utilities face competition from IPPs; customer self-generation, with or without cogeneration; customer energy storage; and the potential formation of community-based, cooperative ownership or municipality structures for electrical service on all islands it serves.  With the exception of certain identified projects, the Utilities are required to use competitive bidding to acquire a future generation resource unless the PUC finds competitive bidding to be unsuitable. The PUC set policies for distributed generation (DG) interconnection agreements and standby rates. The results of competitive bidding, competition from IPPs, customer self-generation, and potential cooperative ownership or municipality structures for electric utility service, and the rate at which technological developments facilitating nonutility generation of electricity, combined heat and power technology, off-grid microgrids, and customer energy storage may adversely affect the Utilities and the results of their operations. •New technological developments, such as the commercial development of energy storage and microgrids, may render the operations of the Utilities less competitive or outdated.The Company may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions, cyber attacks and breaches in data security that could adversely affect its businesses and reputation.  Utilities.  The Utilities rely on networks, information systems and other technologies, including the Internet and third-party hosted services to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, invoicing and collection of payments, customer relationship management, human resource management, the acquisition, generation and delivery of electrical service to customers, and to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting and legal and tax requirements. The Utilities use their systems and infrastructure to create, collect, store, and process sensitive information, including personal information regarding customers, employees and their dependents, retirees, and other individuals. In addition, the Utilities are pursuing complex business transformation initiatives, which include establishing common processes across Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric and the upgrade or replacement of existing systems. Significant system changes increase the risk of system interruptions. Although the Utilities maintain change management processes to mitigate this risk, system interruptions may occur. Further, delay or failure to complete the integration of information systems and processes may result in delays in regulatory cost recovery, increased service interruptions of aging legacy systems, or the failure to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives.As noted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the utility industry is continuing to experience an increase in the frequency and sophistication of cyber security incidents. The Utilities’ systems have been, and will likely continue to be, a target of attacks. Although the Utilities have not experienced a material cyber security breach to date, such incidents may occur and may have a material adverse effect on the Company in the future. In order to address cyber security risks to their information systems, the Utilities maintain security measures designed to protect their information technology systems, network infrastructure and other assets. The Utilities actively monitor developments in the area of cyber security and are involved in various related government and industry groups. Although the Utilities continue to make investments in their cyber security program, including personnel, technologies, cyber insurance and training of Utilities personnel, there can be no assurance that these systems or their expected functionality will be implemented, maintained, or expanded effectively; nor can security measures completely eliminate the possibility of a cyber security breach. If the Utilities’ cyber security measures were to be breached, the Utilities could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to their reputation.27The Utilities are in the process of replacing their existing ERP system. Although the Utilities have in place measures, including redundant systems and recovery capabilities to mitigate system interruptions to their systems, until the new system is put into service the Utilities face elevated operational risk from reliance on old and no longer fully supported software, including the possibility of increased frequency, duration and impact of interruptions.The Utilities have disaster recovery plans in place to protect their businesses from information technology service interruptions caused by natural disasters, security breaches, user error, unintentional defects created by system changes, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures or similar events. The disaster recovery plans, however, may not be successful in preventing the loss of customer data, service interruptions and disruptions to operations or damage to important facilities. If any of these systems fail to operate properly or becomes disabled and the Utilities’ disaster recovery plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, the Utilities could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to their reputations.ASB.  ASB is highly dependent on its ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions and relies heavily on communication and information systems, including those of third party vendors and other service providers. Communication and information system failures can result from a variety of risks including, but not limited to, events that are wholly or partially out of ASB’s control, such as communication line integrity, weather, terrorist acts, natural disasters, accidental disasters, unauthorized breaches of security systems, energy delivery systems, cyber-attacks and other events.ASB is under continuous threat of loss due to cyber-attacks, especially as the Bank continues to expand customer capabilities to utilize the Internet and other remote channels to transact business. Two of the most significant cyber-attack risks that ASB faces are e-fraud and loss of sensitive customer data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals extract funds directly from customers’ or ASB's accounts using fraudulent schemes that may include Internet-based funds transfers. The Bank has been subject to e-fraud incidents historically. Loss of sensitive customer data are attempts to steal sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, through unauthorized access to our computer systems, including computer hacking. Such attacks are less frequent, but could present significant reputational, legal and regulatory costs if successful. Intrusion detection and prevention systems, anti-virus software, firewalls and other general information technology controls have been put in place to detect and prevent cyber-attacks or information system breaches. A disaster recovery plan has been developed in the event of a natural disaster, security breach, military or terrorist action, power or communication failure or similar event. The disaster recovery plan, however, may not be successful in preventing the loss of customer data, service interruptions, disruptions to operations or damage to important facilities. Although ASB devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the Bank’s computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the Bank and its customers, there can be no assurance that such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately corrected by ASB or its vendors.To date, ASB has not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, but there can be no assurance that the Bank will not suffer such losses in the future. If any of these systems fail to operate properly or become disabled even for a brief period of time, ASB could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to its reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on ASB’s financial condition and results of operations. HEI’s businesses could suffer losses that are uninsured due to a lack of affordable insurance coverage, unavailability of insurance coverage or limitations on the insurance coverage the Company does have.  In the ordinary course of business, HEI and its subsidiaries purchase insurance coverages (e.g., property and liability coverages) to protect against loss of, or damage to, their properties and against claims made by third parties and employees for property damage or personal injuries. However, the protection provided by such insurance is limited in significant respects and, in some instances, there is no coverage. Certain of the insurance has substantial deductibles or has limits on the maximum amounts that may be recovered. For example, the Utilities’ overhead and underground transmission and distribution systems (with the exception of substation buildings and contents) have a replacement value roughly estimated at $7 billion and are largely not insured against loss or damage because the amount of transmission and distribution system insurance available is limited and the premiums are cost prohibitive. Similarly, the Utilities have no business interruption insurance as the premiums for such insurance would be cost prohibitive, particularly since the Utilities are not interconnected to other systems. If a hurricane or other uninsured catastrophic natural disaster were to occur, and if the PUC were not to allow the affected Utilities to recover from ratepayers restoration costs and revenues lost from business interruption, the lost revenues and repair expenses could result in a significant decrease in HEI’s consolidated net income or in significant net losses for the affected periods.ASB generally does not obtain credit enhancements, such as mortgagor bankruptcy insurance, but does require standard hazard and hurricane insurance and may require flood insurance for certain properties. ASB is subject to the risks of borrower defaults and bankruptcies, special hazard losses not covered by the required insurance and the insurance company’s inability to pay claims on existing policies.28Increased federal and state environmental regulation will require an increasing commitment of resources and funds and could result in construction delays or penalties and fines for non-compliance. HEI and its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, hazardous substances, waste management, natural resources and health and safety, which regulate, among other matters, the operation of existing facilities, the construction and operation of new facilities and the proper cleanup and disposal of hazardous and toxic wastes and substances. HEI or its subsidiaries are currently involved in investigatory or remedial actions at current, former or third-party sites and there is no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs relating to these sites. In addition, compliance with these legal requirements requires the Utilities to commit significant resources and funds toward, among other things, environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment and payment of emission fees. These laws and regulations, among other things, require that certain environmental permits be obtained in order to construct or operate certain facilities, and obtaining such permits can entail significant expense and cause substantial construction delays. Also, these laws and regulations may be amended from time to time, including amendments that increase the burden and expense of compliance. For example, emission and/or discharge limits may be tightened, more extensive permitting requirements may be imposed and additional substances may become regulated. In addition, significant regulatory uncertainty exists regarding the impact of federal or state greenhouse gas (GHG) emission limits and reductions.If HEI or its subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond their control, that failure may result in civil or criminal penalties and fines or the cessation of operations.Adverse tax rulings or developments could result in significant increases in tax payments and/or expense.  Governmental taxing authorities could challenge a tax return position taken by HEI or its subsidiaries and, if the taxing authorities prevail, HEI’s consolidated tax payments and/or expense, including applicable penalties and interest, could increase significantly.The Company could be subject to the risk of uninsured losses in excess of its accruals for litigation matters.  HEI and its subsidiaries are involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of their businesses, most of which is covered by insurance (subject to policy limits and deductibles). However, other litigation may arise that is not routine or involves claims that may not be covered by insurance. Because of the uncertainties associated with litigation, there is a risk that litigation against HEI or its subsidiaries, even if vigorously defended, could result in costs of defense and judgment or settlement amounts not covered by insurance and in excess of reserves established in HEI’s consolidated financial statements.Changes in accounting principles and estimates could affect the reported amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities or revenues and expenses.  HEI’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Changes in accounting principles (including the possible adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards or new U.S. accounting standards), or changes in the Company’s application of existing accounting principles, could materially affect the financial statement presentation of HEI’s or the Utilities’ consolidated results of operations and/or financial condition. Further, in preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the amounts reported for electric utility revenues; allowance for loan losses; income taxes; investment securities, property, plant and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; derivatives; goodwill; pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; contingencies; and litigation.The Utilities' financial statements reflect assets and costs based on cost-based rate-making regulations. Continued accounting in this manner requires that certain criteria relating to the recoverability of such costs through rates be met. If events or circumstances should change so that the criteria are no longer satisfied, the Utilities’ expect that their regulatory assets (amounting to $957 million as of December 31, 2016), net of regulatory liabilities (amounting to $411 million as of December 31, 2016), would be charged to the statement of income in the period of discontinuance. Changes in accounting principles can also impact HEI’s consolidated financial statements. For example, if management determines that a PPA requires the consolidation of the IPP in the Consolidated Financial Statements, the consolidation could have a material effect on Hawaiian Electric’s and HEI’s consolidated financial statements, including the recognition of a significant amount of assets and liabilities and, if such a consolidated IPP were operating at a loss and had insufficient equity, the potential recognition of such losses. Also, if management determines that a PPA requires the classification of the agreement as a capital lease, a material effect on HEI’s consolidated balance sheet may result, including the recognition of significant capital assets and lease obligations.Changes in the accounting principles for expected credit losses were issued by the FASB to replace existing impairment models, including replacing an “incurred loss” model for loans with a “current expected credit loss” model based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The changes also require enhanced disclosures to help financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization’s portfolio. The Company plans to adopt the accounting principle 29changes in the first quarter of 2020 and has not yet determined the impact of the adoption. The new impairment model could have a material adverse impact on ASB’s results of operations.Standards on accounting for revenues from contracts with customers were issued by the FASB in 2014 and 2016. The core principle of the guidance in Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has identified its revenue streams from, and performance obligations to, customers, and is currently evaluating the impacts of the new guidance on its ability to recognize revenue for certain contracts where there is uncertainty regarding collection and accounting for contributions in aid of construction.  In addition, the Company will separately present sales from electricity and revenues from decoupling either on the financial statements or in the notes. The Company plans to adopt ASU No. 2014-09 (and subsequently issued revenue-related ASUs, as applicable) in the first quarter of 2018, but has not determined the method of adoption (full or modified retrospective application). The Company expects to present more revenue disclosures, but the full impact of adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 on its results of operations, financial condition and liquidity cannot be determined until its evaluation process is complete.Electric Utility Risks.Actions of the PUC are outside the control of the Utilities and could result in inadequate or untimely rate increases, in rate reductions or refunds or in unanticipated delays, expenses or writedowns in connection with the construction of new projects.  The rates the Utilities are allowed to charge for their services and the timeliness of permitted rate increases are among the most important items influencing the Utilities’ results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The PUC has broad discretion over the rates that the Utilities charge their customers. As part of the decoupling mechanism that the Utilities have implemented, each of the Utilities will file a rate case once every three years. Any adverse decision by the PUC concerning the level or method of determining electric utility rates, the items and amounts that may be included in rate base, the returns on equity or rate base found to be reasonable, the potential consequences of exceeding or not meeting such returns, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding could have a material adverse effect on Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.To improve the timing and certainty of the recovery of their costs, the Utilities have proposed and received approval of various cost recovery mechanisms including an ECAC and pension and OPEB tracking mechanisms, as well as a decoupling mechanism, a PPAC, and a renewable energy infrastructure program (REIP) surcharge. A change in, or the elimination of, any of these cost recovery mechanisms, including in the current proceeding in which the PUC is examining the decoupling mechanism, could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities.The Utilities could be required to refund to their customers, with interest, revenues that have been or may be received under interim rate orders in their rate case proceedings, integrated resource plan cost recovery dockets and other proceedings, if and to the extent they exceed the amounts allowed in final orders.Many public utility projects require PUC approval and various permits (e.g., environmental and land use permits) from other governmental agencies. Difficulties in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, the necessary approvals or permits, or any adverse decision or policy made or adopted, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision, by an agency with respect to such approvals and permits, can result in significantly increased project costs or even cancellation of projects. In the event a project does not proceed, or if the PUC disallows cost recovery for all or part of a project, or if project costs exceed caps imposed by the PUC in its approval of the project, project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could result in significant reductions in Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated net income. For example, in January 2013, the Utilities and the Consumer Advocate signed a settlement agreement to write off $40 million of costs in lieu of conducting PUC-ordered regulatory audits of the CIP CT-1 and the CIS projects. Energy cost adjustment clauses. The rate schedules of each of the Utilities include ECACs under which electric rates charged to customers are automatically adjusted for changes in the weighted-average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power, and the relative amounts of company-generated power and purchased power.ECACs are subject to periodic review by the PUC. In the most recent rate cases, the PUC allowed the current ECAC to continue. However, in the decoupling reexamination proceeding, certain parties recommended modifying the ECAC to allow only partial pass-through of fuel costs and eventual phasing out of the ECAC. On March 31, 2015, the PUC issued an Order (the March Order) related to the Schedule B portion of the proceeding. As required by the March Order, the parties filed initial and reply briefs related to the following issue: What are the appropriate steps, processes and timing to further consider the merits of the proposed changes to the ECAC identified in this proceeding. In identifying the issue on possible changes to the ECAC, the PUC stated that changes to the ECAC should be made with great care to avoid unintended consequences. In its briefs, the Consumer Advocate stated that there should be no significant change to the existing ECAC without first undertaking 30a new regulatory proceeding that would provide time and resources for the careful study of the potential effects of each ECAC change considered, but that there should be significantly greater ECAC audit and regulatory review of the Utilities’ incurred fuel costs should be implemented to encourage cost control and to identify and deny recovery of any imprudently incurred energy costs through the ECAC. In their briefs, the Utilities suggested ways of improving the ECAC but stated that permitting only the partial pass through of fuel costs would not be proper regulatory policy since the Utilities have no control over world oil markets, 42 of the 50 states provide dollar-for-dollar pass through of market-driven changes in fuel or purchase power costs and modifying the ECAC to allow only partial pass-through of fuel costs could severely impact the Utilities’ credit rating.In approving Hawaii Electric Light’s request to file a rate case by the end of December 30, 2016, the PUC required Hawaii Electric Light to propose for PUC consideration potential modifications to its ECAC mechanism in order to provide appropriate economic incentives to accelerate reductions in fuel and purchased power expenses.Hawaii Electric Light and Hawaiian Electric proposed modifications to their ECAC provisions in their rate cases filed in 2016. The two utilities proposed an expansion of the range of fuel usage efficiencies under which fuel costs would be fully passed through to customers, and an additional trigger that would allow a re-establishment of fuel usage efficiency targets under certain conditions. In addition, Hawaii Electric Light proposed an equal sharing of fuel expenses outside the fuel usage efficiency target range. A change in, or the elimination of, the ECAC could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities.Electric utility operations are significantly influenced by weather conditions.  The Utilities’ results of operations can be affected by the weather. Weather conditions, particularly temperature and humidity, directly influence the demand for electricity. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis and lightning storms, which may become more severe or frequent as a result of global climate changes, can cause outages and property damage and require the Utilities to incur significant additional expenses that may not be recoverable.Electric utility operations depend heavily on third-party suppliers of fuel and purchased power.  The Utilities rely on fuel oil suppliers and shippers and IPPs to deliver fuel oil and power, respectively, in accordance with contractual agreements. Approximately 68% of the net energy generated or purchased by the Utilities in 2016 was generated from the burning of fossil fuel oil, and purchases of power by the Utilities provided about 47% of their total net energy generated and purchased for the same period. Failure or delay by oil suppliers and shippers to provide fuel pursuant to existing contracts, or failure by a major IPP to deliver the firm capacity anticipated in its PPA, could disrupt the ability of the Utilities to deliver electricity and require the Utilities to incur additional expenses to meet the needs of their customers that may not be recoverable. In addition, as the IPP contracts near the end of their terms, there may be less economic incentive for the IPPs to make investments in their units to ensure the availability of their units. Also, as these contractual agreements end, the Utilities may not be able to purchase fuel and power on terms equivalent to the current contractual agreements.Electric utility generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated and/or increased operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs.  Operation of electric generating facilities involves certain risks which can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels. Included among these risks are facility shutdowns or power interruptions due to insufficient generation or a breakdown or failure of equipment or processes. In addition, operations could be negatively impacted by interruptions in fuel supply, inability to negotiate satisfactory collective bargaining agreements when existing agreements expire or other labor disputes, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements, disruptions in delivery of electricity, operator error and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, fires, explosions, floods or other similar occurrences affecting the Utilities’ generating facilities or transmission and distribution systems.The Utilities may be adversely affected by new legislation or administrative actions.  Congress, the Hawaii legislature and governmental agencies periodically consider legislation and other initiatives that could have uncertain or negative effects on the Utilities and their customers. Congress, the Hawaii legislature and governmental agencies have adopted, or are considering adopting, a number of measures that will significantly affect the Utilities, as described below.Renewable Portfolio Standards law.  In 2015, Hawaii’s RPS law was amended to require electric utilities to meet an RPS of 15%, 30%, 40%, 70% and 100% by December 31, 2015, 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2045 respectively. Energy savings resulting from energy efficiency programs do not count toward the RPS after 2014. The Utilities are committed to achieving these goals and met the 2015 RPS; however, due to the exclusion of energy savings in calculating RPS after 2014 and risks such as potential delays in IPPs being able to deliver contracted renewable energy, it is possible the Utilities may not attain the required renewable percentages in the future, and management cannot predict the future consequences of failure to do so (including potential penalties to be assessed by the PUC). On December 19, 2008, the PUC approved a penalty of $20 for every MWh that an electric utility is deficient under Hawaii’s RPS law. The PUC noted, however, that this penalty may be reduced, in the PUC’s discretion, due to events or circumstances that are outside an electric utility’s reasonable control, to the extent the 31event or circumstance could not be reasonably foreseen and ameliorated, as described in the RPS law and in an RPS framework adopted by the PUC. In addition, the PUC ordered that the Utilities will be prohibited from recovering any RPS penalty costs through rates.Renewable energy.  In 2007, a measure was passed by the Hawaii legislature stating that the PUC may consider the need for increased renewable energy in rendering decisions on utility matters. Due to this measure, it is possible that, if energy from a renewable source is more expensive than energy from fossil fuel, the PUC may still approve the purchase of energy from the renewable source, resulting in higher costs.Global climate change and greenhouse gas emissions reduction.  National and international concern about climate change and the contribution of GHG emissions (including carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels) to climate change have led to federal legislative and regulatory proposals and action by the state of Hawaii to reduce GHG emissions. In July 2007, the State Legislature passed Act 234, which requires a statewide reduction of GHG emissions by January 1, 2020 to levels at or below the statewide GHG emission levels in 1990. On June 20, 2014, the Governor signed the final rules required to implement Act 234 and these rules went into effect on June 30, 2014. In general, Act 234 and the GHG rule require affected sources that have the potential to emit GHGs in excess of established thresholds to reduce their GHG emissions by 16% below 2010 emission levels by 2020. In accordance with State requirements, the Utilities submitted an Emissions Reduction Plan (EmRP) to the DOH on June 30, 2015. Hawaiian Electric, Maui Electric, and Hawaii Electric Light have a total of 11 facilities affected by the state GHG rule. Hawaiian Electric made use of the partnering provisions in the GHG rule to prepare one EmRP for all 11 of the Utilities’ affected facilities. In this plan, the Utilities have committed to a 16% reduction in GHG emissions company-wide. Pursuant to the State’s GHG rule, the DOH will incorporate the proposed facility-specific GHG emission limits into each facility’s covered source permit based on the 2020 levels specified in Hawaiian Electric’s EmRP. The State GHG rule requires affected sources to pay an annual fee that is based on tons per year of GHG emissions. The Utilities’ GHG emissions fee is approximately $0.5 million annually. The latest assessment of the proposed federal and final state GHG rules is that the continued growth in renewable power generation will significantly reduce the compliance costs and risk for the Utilities.On June 3, 2010, the EPA’s final GHG Tailoring Rule was published. It created a new threshold for GHG emissions from new and existing facilities and required certain facilities to obtain Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V operating permits. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld that the EPA can apply the Best Available Control Technology (BACT) requirement to GHG for new or modified sources that trigger PSD permitting for air pollutants other than GHG. Any Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light, and Maui Electric new or modified emission sources that trigger PSD permitting will be required to comply with BACT requirements. On August 26, 2016, the EPA proposed revisions to the PSD and Title V permitting regulations to fully implement the 2014 U.S. Supreme Court decision including the establishment of a threshold below which BACT is not required for GHG emissions for new or modified emission sources that trigger PSD permitting.As part of President Obama’s Climate Action Plan, the EPA issued the final federal rule for GHG emission reductions from existing EGUs on August 3, 2015. This rule is also known as the Clean Power Plan. This rule sets interim state-wide emissions limits for existing EGUs operating in the 48 contiguous states that must be met on average from 2022 through 2029; final limits will apply from 2030. The EPA did not issue final guidelines for Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, or Guam because the Best System of Emission Reduction established for the contiguous states is not appropriate for these locations. The EPA has said it will work with the state and territorial governments for Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam and other stakeholders to gather additional information regarding the emissions reduction measures available in these jurisdictions, particularly with respect to renewable generation. Hawaiian Electric plans to participate in this process. The Utilities’ latest assessment of the Clean Power Plan is that the continued growth of renewable power generation in the future will significantly reduce the compliance costs and risk for the Utilities. To date, no timetable has been established by the EPA to develop GHG emission limits for Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, or Guam.While the timing, extent and ultimate effects of climate change cannot be determined with any certainty, climate change is predicted to result in sea level rise, which could potentially impact coastal and other low-lying areas (where much of the Utilities’ electric infrastructure is sited), and could cause erosion of beaches, saltwater intrusion into aquifers and surface ecosystems, higher water tables and increased flooding and storm damage due to heavy rainfall. The effects of climate change on the weather (for example, floods or hurricanes), sea levels, and water availability and quality have the potential to materially adversely affect the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities. For example, severe weather could cause significant harm to the Utilities’ physical facilities. The Utilities have taken, and continue to identify opportunities to take, direct action to reduce GHG emissions from their operations, including, but not limited to, supporting DSM programs that foster energy efficiency, using renewable resources for energy production and purchasing power from IPPs generated by renewable resources, burning renewable biodiesel in 32Hawaiian Electric’s CIP CT-1, using biodiesel for startup and shutdown of selected Maui Electric generating units, and testing biofuel blends in other Hawaiian Electric and Maui Electric generating units. Management is unable to evaluate the ultimate impact on the Utilities of these various measures to reduce GHG emissions.The foregoing legislation or legislation that now is, or may in the future be, proposed present risks and uncertainties for the Utilities.The Utilities may be subject to increased operational challenges and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely impacted in meeting the commitments and objectives of clean energy initiatives and Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS).  The far-reaching nature of the Utilities' renewable energy commitments and the RPS goals present risks to the Company. Among such risks are: (1) the dependence on third party suppliers of renewable purchased energy, which if the Utilities are unsuccessful in negotiating purchased power agreements with such IPPs or if a major IPP fails to deliver the anticipated capacity in its purchased power agreement, could impact the Utilities’ achievement of their commitments to RPS goals and/or the Utilities’ ability to deliver reliable service; (2) delays in acquiring or unavailability of non-fossil fuel supplies for renewable generation; (3) the impact of intermittent power to the electrical grid and reliability of service if appropriate supporting infrastructure is not installed or does not operate effectively; (4) the likelihood that the Utilities may need to make substantial investments in related infrastructure, which could result in increased borrowings and, therefore, materially impact the financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities; and (5) the commitment to support a variety of initiatives, which, if approved by the PUC, may have a material impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the Utilities depending on their design and implementation. Bank Risks.Fluctuations in interest rates could result in lower net interest income, impair ASB’s ability to originate new loans or impair the ability of ASB’s adjustable-rate borrowers to make increased payments.  Interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASB’s operations. ASB’s net interest income consists primarily of interest income received on fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, mortgage-related securities and investments and interest expense consisting primarily of interest paid on deposits and other borrowings. Interest rate risk arises when earning assets mature or when their interest rates change in a time frame different from that of the costing liabilities. Changes in market interest rates, including changes in the relationship between short-term and long-term market interest rates or between different interest rate indices, can impact ASB’s net interest margin.Although ASB pursues an asset-liability management strategy designed to mitigate its risk from changes in market interest rates, unfavorable movements in interest rates could result in lower net interest income. Residential 1-4 family fixed-rate mortgage loans comprised about 40% of ASB’s loan portfolio as of December 31, 2016 and do not re-price with movements in interest rates. ASB continues to face a challenging interest rate environment. Although the Federal Open Market Committee increased the federal funds rate at its meetings in December 2015 and 2016, the interest rate enviroment remained relatively low in 2016 and new loan production rates remained at low levels and generally below ASB's loan portfolio yields. This placed additional pressure on ASB's asset yields and net interest margin. The degree to which compression of ASB's margin continues is uncertain if interest rates rise.Increases in market interest rates could have an adverse impact on ASB’s cost of funds. Higher market interest rates could lead to higher interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Significant increases in market interest rates, or the perception that an increase may occur, could adversely affect ASB’s ability to originate new loans and grow. An increase in market interest rates, especially a sudden increase, could also adversely affect the ability of ASB’s adjustable-rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations. If this occurred, it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets and charge-offs. Conversely, a decrease in interest rates or a mismatching of maturities of interest sensitive financial instruments could result in an acceleration in the prepayment of loans and mortgage-related securities and impact ASB’s ability to reinvest its liquidity in similar yielding assets. ASB’s operations are affected by factors that are beyond its control, that could result in lower revenues, higher expenses or decreased demand for its products and services.  ASB’s results of operations depend primarily on the income generated by the supply of and demand for its products and services, which primarily consist of loans and deposit services. ASB’s revenues and expenses may be adversely affected by various factors, including:•local, regional, national and other economic and political conditions that could result in declines in employment and real estate values, which in turn could adversely affect the ability of borrowers to make loan payments and the ability of ASB to recover the full amounts owing to it under defaulted loans;•the ability of borrowers to obtain insurance and the ability of ASB to place insurance where borrowers fail to do so, particularly in the event of catastrophic damage to collateral securing loans made by ASB;•faster than expected loan prepayments that can cause an acceleration of the amortization of premiums on loans and investments and the impairment of mortgage servicing assets of ASB;33•changes in ASB’s loan portfolio credit profiles and asset quality, which may increase or decrease the required level of allowance for loan losses;•technological disruptions affecting ASB’s operations or financial or operational difficulties experienced by any outside vendor on whom ASB relies to provide key components of its business operations, such as business processing, network access or internet connections;•the impact of legislative and regulatory changes, including changes affecting capital requirements, increasing oversight of and reporting by banks, or affecting the lending programs or other business activities of ASB;•additional legislative changes regulating the assessment of overdraft, interchange and credit card fees, which can have a negative impact on noninterest income;•public opinion about ASB and financial institutions in general, which, if negative, could impact the public’s trust and confidence in ASB and adversely affect ASB’s ability to attract and retain customers and expose ASB to adverse legal and regulatory consequences;•increases in operating costs (including employee compensation expense and benefits and regulatory compliance costs), inflation and other factors, that exceed increases in ASB’ s net interest, fee and other income; and•the ability of ASB to maintain or increase the level of deposits, ASB’s lowest costing funds.Banking and related regulations could result in significant restrictions being imposed on ASB’s business or in a requirement that HEI divest ASB.  ASB is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the Department of Treasury, the OCC and the FDIC, and is subject to reserve requirements established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In addition, the FRB is responsible for regulating ASB’s holding companies, HEI and ASB Hawaii. The regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies to address not only ASB’s compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations, but also capital adequacy, asset quality, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity and various other factors.Under certain circumstances, including any determination that ASB’s relationship with HEI results in an unsafe and unsound banking practice, these regulatory authorities have the authority to restrict the ability of ASB to transfer assets and to make distributions to its shareholders (including payment of dividends to HEI), or they could seek to require HEI to sever its relationship with or divest its ownership of ASB. Payment by ASB of dividends to HEI may also be restricted by the OCC and FRB under its prompt corrective action regulations or its capital distribution regulations if ASB’s capital position deteriorates. In order to maintain its status as a QTL, ASB is required to maintain at least 65% of its assets in “qualified thrift investments.” Institutions that fail to maintain QTL status are subject to various penalties, including limitations on their activities. In ASB’s case, the activities of HEI and HEI’s other subsidiaries would also be subject to restrictions, and a failure or inability to comply with those restrictions could effectively result in the required divestiture of ASB. Federal legislation has also been proposed in the past that could result in a required divestiture of ASB. In the event of a required divestiture, federal law substantially limits the types of entities that could potentially acquire ASB.Recent legislative and regulatory initiatives could have an adverse effect on ASB’s business.  The Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July 2010, has had a substantial impact on the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes a framework through which regulatory reform will be written and changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies could affect HEI and ASB in substantial and unpredictable ways. A major component of the Dodd-Frank Act is the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that has the responsibility for setting and enforcing clear, consistent rules relating to consumer financial products and services and has the authority to prohibit practices it finds to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. Compliance with any such directives could have adverse effects on ASB’s revenues or operating costs. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on ASB’s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.A large percentage of ASB’s loans and securities are collateralized by real estate, and adverse changes in the real estate market and/or general economic or other conditions may result in loan losses and adversely affect the Company’s profitability.  As of December 31, 2016 approximately 82% of ASB’s loan portfolio was comprised of loans primarily collateralized by real estate, most of which was concentrated in the State of Hawaii. Growth has been in the commercial real estate and commercial construction loan portfolios which now comprise approximately 24% of total real estate loans. ASB’s financial results may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions, either nationally or in the state of Hawaii, including decreases in real estate values, adverse employment conditions, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal and state government and other significant external events. Adverse changes in the economy may have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans. A deterioration of the economic environment in Hawaii, including a material decline in the real estate market, further declines in home resales, or a material external shock, or any environmental clean-up obligation, may also significantly impair the value of ASB’s collateral and ASB’s ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. In the event of a default, amounts received upon sale of the collateral may be insufficient to recover outstanding principal and interest. In addition, if poor economic conditions result in decreased demand for real estate loans, ASB’s profits may decrease if its alternative investments earn less income than real estate loans.34ASB’s strategy to expand its commercial, commercial real estate and consumer lending activities may result in higher costs and greater credit risk than residential lending activities due to the unique characteristics of these markets.  ASB has been aggressively pursuing a strategy that includes expanding its commercial, commercial real estate and consumer lines of business. ASB's commercial real estate and commercial construction loan portfolios grew by 16% and 26%, respectively, during 2016 and now comprise 20% of total loans. The commercial loan portfolio, after several years of growth, decreased by 9% during 2016 and now comprises 15% of total loans. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of a portion of ASB's syndicated national credit loan portfolio. Commercial and commercial real estate loans generally entail higher underwriting and other service costs and present greater credit risks than traditional residential mortgages. The growth in the consumer loan portfolio was primarily due to growth in personal loans as ASB began offering a personal loan product with risk-based pricing. This loan product is unsecured and repayment is based on the borrower’s financial stability. Personal loans are charged off when they become 120 days delinquent.Generally, both commercial and commercial real estate loans have shorter terms to maturity and earn higher spreads than residential mortgage loans. Only the assets of the business typically secure commercial loans. In such cases, upon default, any collateral repossessed may not be sufficient to repay the outstanding loan balance. In addition, loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and, thus, are more likely to be affected by current economic conditions and adverse business developments.ASB has a national syndicated lending portfolio where ASB is a participant in credit facilities agented by established and reputable national lenders. Management selectively chooses each deal based on conservative credit criteria to ensure a high quality, well diversified portfolio. In the event the borrower encounters financial difficulties and ASB is unable to sell its participation interest in the loan in the secondary market, the bank is typically reliant on the originating lender for managing any loan workout or foreclosure proceedings that may become necessary. Accordingly, ASB has less control over such proceedings than loans it originates and may be required to accommodate the interests of other participating lenders in resolving delinquencies or defaults on participated loans, which could result in outcomes that are not fully consistent with ASB's preferred strategies. In addition, a significant proportion of ASB's syndicated loans are originated in states other than Hawaii, and are subject to the local regional and regulatory risks specific to those states.Similar to the national syndicated lending portfolio, ASB does not service commercial loans in which it has participation interests rather than being the lead or agent lender and is subject to the policies and practices of the agent lender, who is the loan servicer, in resolving delinquencies or defaults on participated loans.Commercial real estate properties tend to be unique and are more difficult to value than residential real estate properties. Commercial real estate loans may not be fully amortizing, meaning that they may have a significant principal balance or “balloon” payment due at maturity. In addition, commercial real estate properties, particularly industrial and warehouse properties, are generally subject to relatively greater environmental risks than noncommercial properties and to the corresponding burdens and costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Also, there may be costs and delays involved in enforcing rights of a property owner against tenants in default under the terms of leases with respect to commercial properties. For example, a tenant may seek the protection of bankruptcy laws, which could result in termination of the tenant’s lease.ASB's allowance for loan losses may not cover actual loan losses. ASB's allowance for loan losses is the bank's estimate of probable losses inherent in its loan portfolio and is based on a continuing assessment of:•existing risks in the loan portfolio;•historical loss experience with ASB's loans;•changes in collateral value; and•current conditions (for example, economic conditions, real estate market conditions and interest rate environment).If ASB's actual loan losses exceed its allowance for loan losses, it may incur losses, its financial condition may be materially and adversely affected and additional capital may be required to enhance its capital position. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, regularly review the adequacy of ASB's allowance. These agencies may require ASB to establish additional allowances based on their judgment of the information available at the time of their examinations. No assurance can be given that ASB will not sustain loan losses in excess of present or future levels of its allowance for loan losses"
14,HE,HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC INDS,2016-02-23,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSThe businesses of HEI and its subsidiaries involve numerous risks which, if realized, could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements. In addition, there are numerous risks relating to the Merger and Spin-Off. For additional information for certain risk factors enumerated below and other risks of the Company and its operations, see “Forward-Looking Statements” above and HEI’s MD&A, HEI’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk”, the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Hawaiian Electric’s MD&A, Hawaiian Electric’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”Risk Factors
 Relating to the Merger. Failure to complete the Merger could negatively impact the stock price and the future business and financial results of HEI.  If the Merger is not completed, the ongoing business of HEI may be adversely affected as a result of several risks, including the following:•having to pay certain costs relating to the proposed Merger and the Spin-Off, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor, filing, printing and mailing fees;•having had HEI’s management being focused on the Merger, which may have led, or could lead, to the disruption of HEI’s ongoing business or inconsistencies in its services, standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect the ability of HEI to maintain relationships with customers, regulators, vendors and employees, or could otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of HEI, without realizing any of the benefits of having the Merger completed; and•having had HEI’s management focused on the Merger instead of on pursuing other opportunities that could be beneficial to HEI, without realizing any of the benefits of having the Merger completed.If the Merger is not completed, HEI cannot assure its shareholders that these risks will not materialize and will not materially affect its business, financial results and stock price.The pendency of the Merger could adversely affect the business and operations of HEI.  In connection with the pending Merger, some customers or vendors of HEI’s utilities may delay or defer decisions, which could negatively impact the revenues, earnings, cash flows and expenses of HEI, regardless of whether the Merger is completed. Similarly, current and prospective employees of HEI and its utilities may experience uncertainty about their future roles following the Merger, which may materially adversely affect the ability of HEI and its utilities to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of the Merger. In addition, due to operating covenants in the Merger Agreement, HEI and its utilities may be unable, during the pendency of the Merger, to pursue strategic transactions, undertake significant capital projects, undertake certain significant financing or other specified transactions or pursue actions that are not in the ordinary course of business, even if such actions would prove beneficial.If the Merger is completed, NEE may be unable to successfully integrate HEI’s business.  NEE and HEI currently operate as independent public companies. After the Merger, NEE will be required to devote significant management attention and 25resources to integrating HEI’s business. Potential difficulties NEE may encounter in the integration process include the following:•the complexities associated with integrating HEI and its utility business, while at the same time continuing to provide consistent, high quality services;•the additional complexities of integrating a company with different core services, markets and customers;•the inability to retain key employees;•unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses, delays or onerous regulatory conditions associated with the Merger; and•performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by completing the Merger and integrating HEI’s utility business.For these reasons, the integration process following the Merger could result in the distraction of NEE’s management, the disruption of NEE’s ongoing business or inconsistencies in its services, standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect the ability of NEE to maintain relationships with customers, vendors and employees or could otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of NEE.HEI may be materially adversely affected by negative publicity related to the proposed Merger and in connection with other matters.  From time to time, political and public sentiment in connection with the proposed Merger and in connection with other matters may result in a significant amount of adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting NEE and HEI. Adverse press coverage and other adverse statements, whether or not driven by political or public sentiment, may also result in investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in legal claims. Responding to these investigations and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding, can divert the time and effort of senior management from the management of HEI’s businesses.Addressing any adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny or enforcement or other legal proceedings is time consuming and expensive and, regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made, can have a negative impact on HEI’s reputation, on the morale and performance of its employees and on its relationships with its regulators. It may also have a negative impact on HEI’s ability to take timely advantage of various business and market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects of negative publicity, and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may have a material adverse effect on HEI’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Pending litigation against HEI and NEE could result in an injunction preventing completion of the merger, the payment of damages in the event the merger is completed and/or may adversely affect the combined company's business, financial condition or results of operations following the Merger. Holding Company and Company-Wide Risks.HEI is a holding company that derives its income from its operating subsidiaries and depends on the ability of those subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI and on its own ability to raise capital.  HEI is a legal entity separate and distinct from its various subsidiaries. As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, HEI’s cash flows and consequent ability to service its obligations and pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon its receipt of dividends or other distributions from its operating subsidiaries and its ability to issue common stock or other equity securities and to incur additional debt. The ability of HEI’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI, in turn, is subject to the risks associated with their operations and to contractual and regulatory restrictions, including:•the provisions of an HEI agreement with the PUC, which could limit the ability of HEI’s principal electric public utility subsidiary, Hawaiian Electric, to pay dividends to HEI in the event that the consolidated common stock equity of the Utilities falls below 35% of total capitalization of the electric utilities;•the provisions of an HEI agreement entered into with federal bank regulators in connection with its acquisition of its bank subsidiary, ASB, which require HEI to contribute additional capital to ASB (up to a maximum amount of additional capital of $28.3 million as of December 31, 2015) upon request of the regulators in order to maintain ASB’s regulatory capital at the level required by regulation;•the minimum capital and capital distribution regulations of the OCC that are applicable to ASB and capital regulations that become applicable to HEI and ASB Hawaii;•the receipt of a letter of non-objection or prior approval from the OCC and FRB to the payment of any dividend ASB proposes to declare and pay to ASB Hawaii and HEI; and•the provisions of preferred stock resolutions and debt instruments of HEI and its subsidiaries.The Company is subject to risks associated with the Hawaii economy (in the aggregate and on an individual island basis), volatile U.S. capital markets and changes in the interest rate and credit market environment that have and/or could result in higher retirement benefit plan funding requirements, declines in ASB’s interest rate margins and investment values, higher delinquencies and charge-offs in ASB’s loan portfolio and restrictions on the ability of HEI or its subsidiaries to borrow money or issue securities.  The two largest components of Hawaii’s economy are tourism and the federal government (including the 26military). Because the core businesses of HEI’s subsidiaries are providing local public electric utility services (through Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries) and banking services (through ASB) in Hawaii, the Company’s operating results are significantly influenced by Hawaii’s economy, which in turn is influenced by economic conditions in the mainland U.S. (particularly California) and Asia (particularly Japan) as a result of the impact of those conditions on tourism, by the impact of interest rates on the construction and real estate industries and by the impact of world conditions (e.g., U.S. withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan) on federal government spending in Hawaii. For example, the turmoil in the financial markets and declines in the national and global economies had a negative effect on the Hawaii economy in 2009. In 2009, declines in the Hawaii, U.S. and Asian economies in part led to declines in HEI's share price, an increase in uncollected billings of the Utilities, higher delinquencies in ASB’s loan portfolio, declines in the Company's pension plan asset values and other adverse effects on HEI’s businesses. Also, the decline in the stock market in 2016 to date has resulted in lower pension plan asset values, which could increase future pension contributions and decrease the funded status of the plans.If Fitch, Moody's or S&P were to downgrade HEI’s or Hawaiian Electric’s long-term debt ratings because of past adverse effects, or if future events were to adversely affect the availability of capital to the Company, HEI’s and Hawaiian Electric’s ability to borrow and raise capital could be constrained and their future borrowing costs would likely increase with resulting reductions in HEI’s consolidated net income in future periods. Further, if HEI’s or Hawaiian Electric’s commercial paper ratings were to be downgraded, HEI and Hawaiian Electric might not be able to sell commercial paper and might be required to draw on more expensive bank lines of credit or to defer capital or other expenditures.Changes in the U.S. capital markets can also have significant effects on the Company. For example, pension funding requirements are affected by the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for pension plans, and by the discount rate used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost and value obligations. The Utilities’ pension tracking mechanisms help moderate pension expense; however, the significant decline in 2008 in the value of the Company’s defined benefit pension plan assets resulted in a substantial gap between the projected benefit obligations under the plans and the value of plan assets, resulting in increases in funding requirements. The increases have moderated in recent years as investment performance has improved.Because the earnings of ASB depend primarily on net interest income, interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASB’s operations. HEI and the Utilities are also exposed to interest rate risk primarily due to their periodic borrowing requirements, the discount rate used to determine pension funding requirements and the possible effect of interest rates on the electric utilities’ rates of return. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors, including general economic conditions and the policies of government and regulatory authorities. HEI cannot predict future changes in interest rates, nor be certain that interest rate risk management strategies it or its subsidiaries have implemented will be successful in managing interest rate risk.Interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting the fair value of ASB’s investment securities. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair values of those instruments, respectively. Disruptions in the credit markets, a liquidity crisis in the banking industry or increased levels of residential mortgage delinquencies and defaults may result in decreases in the fair value of ASB’s investment securities and an impairment that is other-than-temporary, requiring ASB to write down its investment securities. As of December 31, 2015, all of ASB’s investment securities were securities and obligations issued by a federal agency or government sponsored entity that have an implicit guarantee from the U.S. government.HEI and Hawaiian Electric and their subsidiaries may incur higher retirement benefits expenses and have and will likely continue to recognize substantial liabilities for retirement benefits.  Retirement benefits expenses and cash funding requirements could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the U.S. equity markets, trends in interest rates and health care costs, plan amendments, new laws relating to pension funding and changes in accounting principles. For the Utilities, however, retirement benefits expenses, as adjusted by the pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions (OPEB) tracking mechanisms, have been an allowable expense for rate-making purposes.The Company is subject to the risks associated with the geographic concentration of its businesses and current lack of interconnections that could result in service interruptions at the Utilities or higher default rates on loans held by ASB.  The business of the Utilities is concentrated on the individual islands they serve in the State of Hawaii. Their operations are more vulnerable to service interruptions than are many U.S. mainland utilities because none of the systems of the Utilities are interconnected with the systems on the other islands they serve. Because of this lack of interconnections, it is necessary to maintain higher generation reserve margins than are typical for U.S. mainland utilities to help ensure reliable service. Service interruptions, including in particular extended interruptions that could result from a natural disaster or terrorist activity, could adversely impact the KWH sales of some or all of the Utilities.Substantially all of ASB’s consumer loan customers are Hawaii residents. A significant portion of the commercial loan customers are located in Hawaii. While a majority of customers are on Oahu, ASB also has customers on the neighbor islands (whose economies have been weaker than Oahu during the recent economic downturn). Substantially all of the real estate 27underlying ASB’s residential and commercial real estate loans are located in Hawaii. These assets may be subject to a greater risk of default than other comparable assets held by financial institutions with other geographic concentrations in the event of adverse economic, political or business developments or natural disasters affecting Hawaii and the ability of ASB’s customers to make payments of principal and interest on their loans.Increasing competition and technological advances could cause HEI’s businesses to lose customers or render their operations obsolete.  The banking industry in Hawaii, and certain aspects of the electric utility industry, are competitive. The success of HEI’s subsidiaries in meeting competition and responding to technological advances will continue to have a direct impact on HEI’s consolidated financial performance. For example:•ASB, one of the largest financial institutions in the state, is in direct competition for deposits and loans not only with two larger institutions that have substantial capital, technology and marketing resources, but also with smaller Hawaii institutions and other U.S. institutions, including credit unions, mutual funds, mortgage brokers, finance companies and investment banking firms. Larger financial institutions may have greater access to capital at lower costs, which could impair ASB’s ability to compete effectively. Significant advances in technology could render the operations of ASB less competitive or obsolete.•The Utilities face competition from IPPs; customer self-generation, with or without cogeneration; customer energy storage; and the potential formation of community-based, cooperative ownership structures for electrical service on the neighbor islands.  With the exception of certain identified projects, the Utilities are required to use competitive bidding to acquire a future generation resource unless the PUC finds competitive bidding to be unsuitable. The PUC set policies for distributed generation (DG) interconnection agreements and standby rates, and established conditions under which electric utilities can provide DG services on customer-owned sites as a regulated service. The results of competitive bidding, competition from IPPs, customer self-generation, and potential cooperative ownership structures for electric utility service, and the rate at which technological developments facilitating nonutility generation of electricity and customer energy storage occur may adversely affect the Utilities and the results of their operations. •New technological developments, such as the commercial development of energy storage and microgrids, may render the operations of the Utilities less competitive or outdated.The Company may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security that could adversely affect its businesses and reputation.  The Company is subject to cyber security risks and the potential for cyber incidents, including potential incidents at ASB branches and at the the Utilities' plants and the related electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure, and incidents at data processing centers they use, to the extent not prevented by intrusion detection and prevention systems, anti-virus software, firewalls and other general information technology controls. ASB and the Utilities are highly dependent on their ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions. ASB and the Utilities rely heavily on numerous data processing systems. If any of these systems fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time, the Company could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to its reputation. The Utilities and ASB have disaster recovery plans in place to protect their businesses against natural disasters, security breaches, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures or similar events. The disaster recovery plans, however, may not be successful in preventing the loss of customer data, service interruptions, disruptions to operations or damage to important facilities.HEI’s businesses could suffer losses that are uninsured due to a lack of affordable insurance coverage, unavailability of insurance coverage or limitations on the insurance coverage the Company does have.  In the ordinary course of business, HEI and its subsidiaries purchase insurance coverages (e.g., property and liability coverages) to protect against loss of, or damage to, their properties and against claims made by third parties and employees for property damage or personal injuries. However, the protection provided by such insurance is limited in significant respects and, in some instances, there is no coverage. Certain of the insurance has substantial deductibles or has limits on the maximum amounts that may be recovered. For example, the Utilities’ overhead and underground transmission and distribution systems (with the exception of substation buildings and contents) have a replacement value roughly estimated at $6 billion and are largely not insured against loss or damage because the amount of transmission and distribution system insurance available is limited and the premiums are cost prohibitive. Similarly, the Utilities have no business interruption insurance as the premiums for such insurance would be cost prohibitive, particularly since the Utilities are not interconnected to other systems. If a hurricane or other uninsured catastrophic natural disaster were to occur, and if the PUC were not to allow the affected Utilities to recover from ratepayers restoration costs and revenues lost from business interruption, the lost revenues and repair expenses could result in a significant decrease in HEI’s consolidated net income or in significant net losses for the affected periods.ASB generally does not obtain credit enhancements, such as mortgagor bankruptcy insurance, but does require standard hazard and hurricane insurance and may require flood insurance for certain properties. ASB is subject to the risks of borrower defaults and bankruptcies, special hazard losses not covered by the required insurance and the insurance company’s inability to pay claims on existing policies.28Increased federal and state environmental regulation will require an increasing commitment of resources and funds and could result in construction delays or penalties and fines for non-compliance. HEI and its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, hazardous substances, waste management, natural resources and health and safety, which regulate, among other matters, the operation of existing facilities, the construction and operation of new facilities and the proper cleanup and disposal of hazardous and toxic wastes and substances. HEI or its subsidiaries are currently involved in investigatory or remedial actions at current, former or third-party sites and there is no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs relating to these sites. In addition, compliance with these legal requirements requires the Utilities to commit significant resources and funds toward, among other things, environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment and payment of emission fees. These laws and regulations, among other things, require that certain environmental permits be obtained in order to construct or operate certain facilities, and obtaining such permits can entail significant expense and cause substantial construction delays. Also, these laws and regulations may be amended from time to time, including amendments that increase the burden and expense of compliance. For example, emission and/or discharge limits may be tightened, more extensive permitting requirements may be imposed and additional substances may become regulated. In addition, significant regulatory uncertainty exists regarding the impact of federal or state greenhouse gas (GHG) emission limits and reductions.If HEI or its subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond their control, that failure may result in civil or criminal penalties and fines or the cessation of operations.Adverse tax rulings or developments could result in significant increases in tax payments and/or expense.  Governmental taxing authorities could challenge a tax return position taken by HEI or its subsidiaries and, if the taxing authorities prevail, HEI’s consolidated tax payments and/or expense, including applicable penalties and interest, could increase significantly.The Company could be subject to the risk of uninsured losses in excess of its accruals for litigation matters.  HEI and its subsidiaries are involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of their businesses, most of which is covered by insurance (subject to policy limits and deductibles). However, other litigation may arise that is not routine (such as the litigation related to the proposed Merger) or involves claims that may not be covered by insurance. Because of the uncertainties associated with litigation, there is a risk that litigation against HEI or its subsidiaries, even if vigorously defended, could result in costs of defense and judgment or settlement amounts not covered by insurance and in excess of reserves established in HEI’s consolidated financial statements.Changes in accounting principles and estimates could affect the reported amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities or revenues and expenses.  HEI’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Changes in accounting principles (including the possible adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards or new U.S. accounting standards), or changes in the Company’s application of existing accounting principles, could materially affect the financial statement presentation of HEI’s or the Utilities’ consolidated results of operations and/or financial condition. Further, in preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the amounts reported for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; contingencies and litigation; income taxes; property, plant and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; electric utility revenues; allowance for loan losses; nonperforming loans; troubled debt restructurings; and fair value.The Utilities' financial statements reflect assets and costs based on cost-based rate-making regulations. Continued accounting in this manner requires that certain criteria relating to the recoverability of such costs through rates be met. If events or circumstances should change so that the criteria are no longer satisfied, the Utilities’ expect that their regulatory assets (amounting to $897 million as of December 31, 2015), net of regulatory liabilities (amounting to $372 million as of December 31, 2015), would be charged to the statement of income in the period of discontinuance. Changes in accounting principles can also impact HEI’s consolidated financial statements. For example, if management determines that a PPA requires the consolidation of the IPP in the Consolidated Financial Statements, the consolidation could have a material effect on Hawaiian Electric’s and HEI’s consolidated financial statements, including the recognition of a significant amount of assets and liabilities and, if such a consolidated IPP were operating at a loss and had insufficient equity, the potential recognition of such losses. Also, if management determines that a PPA requires the classification of the agreement as a capital lease, a material effect on HEI’s consolidated balance sheet may result, including the recognition of significant capital assets and lease obligations.A proposed standard on accounting for expected credit losses was issued by the FASB which would replace existing impairment models, including replacing an “incurred loss” model for loans with a “current expected credit loss” model. There are a number of questions and issues around the expected credit loss model. ASB cannot predict whether or when a final 29standard will be issued, when it will be effective or what it its final provisions will be. It is possible that the final standard could have a material adverse impact on the bank’s results of operations once it is issued and becomes effective.A standard on accounting for revenues from contracts with customers was issued by the FASB in May 2014. The Company plans to adopt this standard in the first quarter of 2017, but has not determined the impact of adoption on its financial statements.The Company has identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting. If the Company fails to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting at a reasonable assurance level, HEI and Hawaiian Electric may not be able to accurately report their financial results, which could have a material adverse effect on their operations, investor confidence in their businesses and the trading prices of their securities.  HEI’s and Hawaiian Electric’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over their financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act.  In connection with the preparation of HEI’s and Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, management along with its independent registered public accounting firm identified a material weakness in the internal control over financial reporting.The material weakness management identified specifically related to the fact that controls were not designed to ensure that non-cash transactions were properly identified and recorded, and management’s review process was not effective. The deficiency resulted in restatements of HEI’s and Hawaiian Electric’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, and the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 and revisions of HEI’s and Hawaiian Electric’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2014.The Company and Hawaiian Electric are actively engaged in remediation efforts to address the material weakness in the internal control over financial reporting. The remediation includes, but is not limited to, a roll forward reconciliation and review of the capital expenditures amount included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, and enhancing templates to facilitate the preparation and review of cash flows. New controls relating to the preparation and review of the Statement of Cash Flows (including improved spreadsheet templates, a reconciliation of cash capital expenditures, enhanced procedures to identify noncash items, and an additional level of management review) have been implemented and will continue to be tested for operational effectivenessIf the Company’s remediation efforts are insufficient to address the identified material weakness or if additional material weaknesses in internal controls are discovered in the future, they may adversely affect the Company’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information timely and accurately and, as a result, the Company’s financial statements may contain material misstatements or omissions.Electric Utility Risks.Actions of the PUC are outside the control of the Utilities and could result in inadequate or untimely rate increases, in rate reductions or refunds or in unanticipated delays, expenses or writedowns in connection with the construction of new projects.  The rates the Utilities are allowed to charge for their services and the timeliness of permitted rate increases are among the most important items influencing the Utilities’ results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The PUC has broad discretion over the rates that the Utilities charge their customers. As part of the decoupling mechanism that the Utilities have implemented, each of the Utilities will file a rate case once every three years. Any adverse decision by the PUC concerning the level or method of determining electric utility rates, the items and amounts that may be included in rate base, the returns on equity or rate base found to be reasonable, the potential consequences of exceeding or not meeting such returns, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding could have a material adverse effect on Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.To improve the timing and certainty of the recovery of their costs, the Utilities have proposed and received approval of various cost recovery mechanisms including an ECAC and pension and OPEB tracking mechanisms, as well as a decoupling mechanism, a PPAC, and a renewable energy infrastructure program (REIP) surcharge. A change in, or the elimination of, any of these cost recovery mechanisms, including in the current proceeding in which the PUC is examining the decoupling mechanism, could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities.The Utilities could be required to refund to their customers, with interest, revenues that have been or may be received under interim rate orders in their rate case proceedings, integrated resource plan cost recovery dockets and other proceedings, if and to the extent they exceed the amounts allowed in final orders.Many public utility projects require PUC approval and various permits (e.g., environmental and land use permits) from other governmental agencies. Difficulties in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, the necessary approvals or permits, or any 30adverse decision or policy made or adopted, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision, by an agency with respect to such approvals and permits, can result in significantly increased project costs or even cancellation of projects. In the event a project does not proceed, or if the PUC disallows cost recovery for all or part of a project, project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could result in significant reductions in Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated net income. For example, in January 2013, the Utilities and the Consumer Advocate signed a settlement agreement to write off $40 million of costs in lieu of conducting PUC-ordered regulatory audits of the CIP CT-1 and the CIS projects. Energy cost adjustment clauses. The rate schedules of each of the Utilities include ECACs under which electric rates charged to customers are automatically adjusted for changes in the weighted-average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power, and the relative amounts of company-generated power and purchased power.ECACs are subject to periodic review by the PUC. In the most recent rate cases, the PUC allowed the current ECAC to continue. However, in the decoupling reexamination proceeding, certain parties recommended modifying the ECAC to allow only partial pass-through of fuel costs and eventual phasing out of the ECAC. The Consumer Advocate stated that there should be no significant change to the existing ECAC without first undertaking a new regulatory proceeding that would provide time and resources for the careful study of the potential effects of each ECAC change considered, but that there should be significantly greater ECAC audit and regulatory review of the Utilities’ incurred fuel costs should be implemented to encourage cost control and to identify and deny recovery of any imprudently incurred energy costs through the ECAC. The Utilities suggested ways of improving the ECAC but stated that permitting only the partial pass through of fuel costs would not be proper regulatory policy since the Utilities have no control over world oil markets, 42 of the 50 states provide dollar-for-dollar pass through of market-driven changes in fuel or purchase power costs and modifying the ECAC to allow only partial pass-through of fuel costs could severely impact the Utilities’ credit rating. A change in, or the elimination of, the ECAC could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities.In approving Hawaii Electric Light’s request to file a rate case by the end of December 30,2016, the PUC required Hawaii Electric Light to propose for PUC consideration potential modifications to its ECAC mechanism in order to provide appropriate economic incentives to accelerate reductions in fuel and purchased power expenses.Electric utility operations are significantly influenced by weather conditions.  The Utilities’ results of operations can be affected by the weather. Weather conditions, particularly temperature and humidity, directly influence the demand for electricity. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis and lightning storms, which may become more severe or frequent as a result of global climate changes, can cause outages and property damage and require the Utilities to incur significant additional expenses that may not be recoverable.Electric utility operations depend heavily on third-party suppliers of fuel and purchased power.  The Utilities rely on fuel oil suppliers and shippers and IPPs to deliver fuel oil and power, respectively, in accordance with contractual agreements. Approximately 70% of the net energy generated or purchased by the Utilities in 2015 was generated from the burning of fossil fuel oil, and purchases of power by the Utilities provided about 46% of their total net energy generated and purchased for the same period. Failure or delay by oil suppliers and shippers to provide fuel pursuant to existing contracts, or failure by a major IPP to deliver the firm capacity anticipated in its PPA, could disrupt the ability of the Utilities to deliver electricity and require the Utilities to incur additional expenses to meet the needs of their customers that may not be recoverable. In addition, as the IPP contracts near the end of their terms, there may be less economic incentive for the IPPs to make investments in their units to ensure the availability of their units. Also, as these contractual agreements end, the Utilities may not be able to purchase fuel and power on terms equivalent to the current contractual agreements. As the use of biofuels in generating units increases, the same risks will exist with suppliers of biofuels.Electric utility generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated and/or increased operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs.  Operation of electric generating facilities involves certain risks which can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels. Included among these risks are facility shutdowns or power interruptions due to insufficient generation or a breakdown or failure of equipment or processes. In January 2015, Hawaiian Electric experienced a generation shortfall event due to unexpected concurrent outages of a utility generating unit and several IPPs. In addition, operations could be negatively impacted by interruptions in fuel supply, inability to negotiate satisfactory collective bargaining agreements when existing agreements expire or other labor disputes, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements, disruptions in delivery of electricity, operator error and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, fires, explosions, floods or other similar occurrences affecting the Utilities’ generating facilities or transmission and distribution systems.The Utilities may be adversely affected by new legislation.  Congress, the Hawaii legislature and governmental agencies periodically consider legislation and other initiatives that could have uncertain or negative effects on the Utilities and their customers. Congress, the Hawaii legislature and governmental agencies have adopted, or are considering adopting, a number of measures that will significantly affect the Utilities, as described below.31Renewable Portfolio Standards law.  In 2015, Hawaii’s RPS law was amended to require electric utilities to meet an RPS of 15%, 30%, 40%, 70% and 100% by December 31, 2015, 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2045 respectively. Energy savings resulting from energy efficiency programs do not count toward the RPS after 2014. The Utilities are committed to achieving these goals and met the 2015 RPS; however, due to the exclusion of energy savings in calculating RPS after 2014 and risks such as potential delays in IPPs being able to deliver contracted renewable energy, it is possible the Utilities may not attain the required renewable percentages in the future, and management cannot predict the future consequences of failure to do so (including potential penalties to be assessed by the PUC). On December 19, 2008, the PUC approved a penalty of $20 for every MWh that an electric utility is deficient under Hawaii’s RPS law. The PUC noted, however, that this penalty may be reduced, in the PUC’s discretion, due to events or circumstances that are outside an electric utility’s reasonable control, to the extent the event or circumstance could not be reasonably foreseen and ameliorated, as described in the RPS law and in an RPS framework adopted by the PUC. In addition, the PUC ordered that the Utilities will be prohibited from recovering any RPS penalty costs through rates.Renewable energy.  In 2007, a measure was passed by the Hawaii legislature stating that the PUC may consider the need for increased renewable energy in rendering decisions on utility matters. Due to this measure, it is possible that, if energy from a renewable source is more expensive than energy from fossil fuel, the PUC may still approve the purchase of energy from the renewable source, resulting in higher costs.Global climate change and greenhouse gas emissions reduction.  National and international concern about climate change and the contribution of GHG emissions (including carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels) to climate change have led to federal legislative and regulatory proposals and action by the state of Hawaii to reduce GHG emissions. In July 2007, the State Legislature passed Act 234, which requires a statewide reduction of GHG emissions by January 1, 2020 to levels at or below the statewide GHG emission levels in 1990. On June 20, 2014, the Governor signed the final rules required to implement Act 234 and these rules went into effect on June 30, 2014. In general, Act 234 and the GHG rule require affected sources that have the potential to emit GHGs in excess of established thresholds to reduce their GHG emissions by 16% below 2010 emission levels by 2020. In accordance with State requirements, the Utilities submitted an Emissions Reduction Plan (EmRP) to the DOH on June 30, 2015. Hawaiian Electric, Maui Electric, and Hawaii Electric Light have a total of 11 facilities affected by the state GHG rule. Hawaiian Electric made use of the partnering provisions in the GHG rule to prepare one EmRP for all 11 of the Utilities’ affected facilities. In this plan, the Utilities have committed to a 16% reduction in GHG emissions company-wide. Pursuant to the State’s GHG rule, the DOH will incorporate the proposed facility-specific GHG emission limits into each facility’s covered source permit based on the 2020 levels specified in Hawaiian Electric’s EmRP. The State GHG rule requires affected sources to pay an annual fee that is based on tons per year of GHG emissions. The Utilities’ GHG emissions fee is approximately $0.5 million annually. The latest assessment of the proposed federal and final state GHG rules is that the continued growth in renewable power generation will significantly reduce the compliance costs and risk for the Utilities.On September 22, 2009, the EPA issued its “Final Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule,” which requires that sources emitting GHGs above certain threshold levels monitor and report their GHG emissions. Following these requirements, the Utilities have submitted the required reports for 2010 through 2014 to the EPA; the 2015 report will be submitted in the first quarter of 2016. Since 2009, the EPA has issued rules to address GHG emissions from stationary sources, like the Utilities’ EGUs.On June 3, 2010, the EPA’s final GHG Tailoring Rule was published. It created a new threshold for GHG emissions from new and existing facilities and required certain facilities to obtain PSD and Title V operating permits. On June 23, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision that invalidated the GHG Tailoring Rule, to the extent it regulated sources based solely on their GHG emissions. It also invalidated the GHG emissions threshold for regulation. On December 19, 2014, EPA released two memorandums outlining its plan for addressing the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision. Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric are evaluating the potential impacts of the EPA’s plan on utility operations and permitting. The current status of the GHG Tailoring Rule and any further action the EPA may take in light of this recent decision remain uncertain. On January 8, 2014, the EPA published in the Federal Register its new proposal for New Source Performance Standards for GHG from new generating units. The proposed rule on GHG from new EGUs does not apply to oil-fired combustion turbines or diesel engine generators, and is not otherwise expected to have significant impacts on the Utilities. As part of President Obama’s Climate Action Plan, the EPA issued the final federal rule for GHG emission reductions from existing EGUs on August 3, 2015. This rule is also known as the Clean Power Plan. This rule sets interim state-wide emissions limits for existing EGUs operating in the 48 contiguous states that must be met on average from 2022 through 2029; final limits will apply from 2030. The EPA did not issue final guidelines for Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, or Guam because the Best System of Emission Reduction established for the contiguous states is not appropriate for these locations. The EPA has said it 32will work with the state and territorial governments for Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam and other stakeholders to gather additional information regarding the emissions reduction measures available in these jurisdictions, particularly with respect to renewable generation. Hawaiian Electric plans to participate in this process. The Utilities’ latest assessment of the Clean Power Plan is that the continued growth of renewable power generation in the future will significantly reduce the compliance costs and risk for the Utilities. To date, no timetable has been established by the EPA to develop GHG emission limits for Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, or Guam.While the timing, extent and ultimate effects of climate change cannot be determined with any certainty, climate change is predicted to result in sea level rise, which could potentially impact coastal and other low-lying areas (where much of the Utilities’ electric infrastructure is sited), and could cause erosion of beaches, saltwater intrusion into aquifers and surface ecosystems, higher water tables and increased flooding and storm damage due to heavy rainfall. The effects of climate change on the weather (for example, floods or hurricanes), sea levels, and water availability and quality have the potential to materially adversely affect the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities. For example, severe weather could cause significant harm to the Utilities’ physical facilities. The Utilities have taken, and continue to identify opportunities to take, direct action to reduce GHG emissions from their operations, including, but not limited to, supporting DSM programs that foster energy efficiency, using renewable resources for energy production and purchasing power from IPPs generated by renewable resources, burning renewable biodiesel in Hawaiian Electric’s CIP CT-1, using biodiesel for startup and shutdown of selected Maui Electric generating units, and testing biofuel blends in other Hawaiian Electric and Maui Electric generating units. The Utilities are also working with the State of Hawaii and other entities to pursue the use of liquefied natural gas as a cleaner and lower cost fuel to replace, at least in part, the petroleum oil that would otherwise be used. Management is unable to evaluate the ultimate impact on the Utilities of these various measures to reduce GHG emissions.The foregoing legislation or legislation that now is, or may in the future be, proposed present risks and uncertainties for the Utilities.The Utilities may be subject to increased operational challenges and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely impacted in meeting the commitments and objectives of clean energy initiatives and Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS).  The far-reaching nature of the Utilities' renewable energy commitments and the RPS goals present risks to the Company. Among such risks are: (1) the dependence on third party suppliers of renewable purchased energy, which if the Utilities are unsuccessful in negotiating purchased power agreements with such IPPs or if a major IPP fails to deliver the anticipated capacity in its purchased power agreement, could impact the Utilities’ achievement of their commitments to RPS goals and/or the Utilities’ ability to deliver reliable service; (2) delays in acquiring or unavailability of non-fossil fuel supplies for renewable generation; (3) the impact of intermittent power to the electrical grid and reliability of service if appropriate supporting infrastructure is not installed or does not operate effectively; (4) the likelihood that the Utilities may need to make substantial investments in related infrastructure, which could result in increased borrowings and, therefore, materially impact the financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities; and (5) the commitment to support a variety of initiatives, which, if approved by the PUC, may have a material impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the Utilities depending on their design and implementation. Bank Risks.Fluctuations in interest rates could result in lower net interest income, impair ASB’s ability to originate new loans or impair the ability of ASB’s adjustable-rate borrowers to make increased payments.  Interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASB’s operations. ASB’s net interest income consists primarily of interest income received on fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, mortgage-related securities and investments and interest expense consisting primarily of interest paid on deposits and other borrowings. Interest rate risk arises when earning assets mature or when their interest rates change in a time frame different from that of the costing liabilities. Changes in market interest rates, including changes in the relationship between short-term and long-term market interest rates or between different interest rate indices, can impact ASB’s net interest margin.Although ASB pursues an asset-liability management strategy designed to mitigate its risk from changes in market interest rates, unfavorable movements in interest rates could result in lower net interest income. Residential 1-4 family fixed-rate mortgage loans comprised about 41% of ASB’s loan portfolio as of December 31, 2015 and do not re-price with movements in interest rates. ASB continues to face a challenging interest rate environment. Interest rates remained low in 2015 and new loan production rates remained at historically low levels and below ASB's loan portfolio yields. This placed additional pressure on ASB's asset yields and net interest margin. The degree to which compression of ASB's margin continues is uncertain if interest rates rise.Increases in market interest rates could have an adverse impact on ASB’s cost of funds. Higher market interest rates could lead to higher interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Significant increases in market interest rates, or the 33perception that an increase may occur, could adversely affect ASB’s ability to originate new loans and grow. An increase in market interest rates, especially a sudden increase, could also adversely affect the ability of ASB’s adjustable-rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations. If this occurred, it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets and charge-offs. Conversely, a decrease in interest rates or a mismatching of maturities of interest sensitive financial instruments could result in an acceleration in the prepayment of loans and mortgage-related securities and impact ASB’s ability to reinvest its liquidity in similar yielding assets. ASB’s operations are affected by factors that are beyond its control, that could result in lower revenues, higher expenses or decreased demand for its products and services.  ASB’s results of operations depend primarily on the income generated by the supply of and demand for its products and services, which primarily consist of loans and deposit services. ASB’s revenues and expenses may be adversely affected by various factors, including:•local, regional, national and other economic and political conditions that could result in declines in employment and real estate values, which in turn could adversely affect the ability of borrowers to make loan payments and the ability of ASB to recover the full amounts owing to it under defaulted loans;•the ability of borrowers to obtain insurance and the ability of ASB to place insurance where borrowers fail to do so, particularly in the event of catastrophic damage to collateral securing loans made by ASB;•faster than expected loan prepayments that can cause an acceleration of the amortization of premiums on loans and investments and the impairment of mortgage servicing assets of ASB;•changes in ASB’s loan portfolio credit profiles and asset quality, which may increase or decrease the required level of allowance for loan losses;•technological disruptions affecting ASB’s operations or financial or operational difficulties experienced by any outside vendor on whom ASB relies to provide key components of its business operations, such as business processing, network access or internet connections;•the impact of legislative and regulatory changes, including changes affecting capital requirements, increasing oversight of and reporting by banks, or affecting the lending programs or other business activities of ASB;•additional legislative changes regulating the assessment of overdraft, interchange and credit card fees, which can have a negative impact on noninterest income;•public opinion about ASB and financial institutions in general, which, if negative, could impact the public’s trust and confidence in ASB and adversely affect ASB’s ability to attract and retain customers and expose ASB to adverse legal and regulatory consequences;•increases in operating costs (including employee compensation expense and benefits and regulatory compliance costs), inflation and other factors, that exceed increases in ASB’ s net interest, fee and other income; and•the ability of ASB to maintain or increase the level of deposits, ASB’s lowest costing funds.Banking and related regulations could result in significant restrictions being imposed on ASB’s business or in a requirement that HEI divest ASB.  ASB is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the Department of Treasury, the OCC and the FDIC, and is subject to reserve requirements established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In addition, the FRB is responsible for regulating ASB’s holding companies, HEI and ASB Hawaii. The regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies to address not only ASB’s compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations, but also capital adequacy, asset quality, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity and various other factors.Under certain circumstances, including any determination that ASB’s relationship with HEI results in an unsafe and unsound banking practice, these regulatory authorities have the authority to restrict the ability of ASB to transfer assets and to make distributions to its shareholders (including payment of dividends to HEI), or they could seek to require HEI to sever its relationship with or divest its ownership of ASB. Payment by ASB of dividends to HEI may also be restricted by the OCC and FRB under its prompt corrective action regulations or its capital distribution regulations if ASB’s capital position deteriorates. In order to maintain its status as a QTL, ASB is required to maintain at least 65% of its assets in “qualified thrift investments.” Institutions that fail to maintain QTL status are subject to various penalties, including limitations on their activities. In ASB’s case, the activities of HEI and HEI’s other subsidiaries would also be subject to restrictions, and a failure or inability to comply with those restrictions could effectively result in the required divestiture of ASB. Federal legislation has also been proposed in the past that could result in a required divestiture of ASB. In the event of a required divestiture, federal law substantially limits the types of entities that could potentially acquire ASB.Recent legislative and regulatory initiatives could have an adverse effect on ASB’s business.  The Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July 2010, has had a substantial impact on the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes a framework through which regulatory reform will be written and changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies could affect HEI and ASB in substantial and unpredictable ways. A major component of the Dodd-Frank Act is the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that has the responsibility for setting and enforcing clear, consistent rules relating to consumer financial products and services and has the authority to prohibit practices it finds to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. 34Compliance with any such directives could have adverse effects on ASB’s revenues or operating costs. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on ASB’s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.A large percentage of ASB’s loans and securities are collateralized by real estate, and adverse changes in the real estate market and/or general economic or other conditions may result in loan losses and adversely affect the Company’s profitability.  As of December 31, 2015 approximately 81% of ASB’s loan portfolio was comprised of loans primarily collateralized by real estate, most of which was concentrated in the State of Hawaii. Growth has been in the commercial real estate loan portfolio which now comprises 18% of total real estate loans. ASB’s financial results may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions, either nationally or in the state of Hawaii, including decreases in real estate values, adverse employment conditions, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal and state government and other significant external events. Adverse changes in the economy may have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans. A deterioration of the economic environment in Hawaii, including a material decline in the real estate market, further declines in home resales, or a material external shock, or any environmental clean-up obligation, may also significantly impair the value of ASB’s collateral and ASB’s ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. In the event of a default, amounts received upon sale of the collateral may be insufficient to recover outstanding principal and interest. In addition, if poor economic conditions result in decreased demand for real estate loans, ASB’s profits may decrease if its alternative investments earn less income than real estate loans.ASB’s strategy to expand its commercial and commercial real estate lending activities may result in higher service costs and greater credit risk than residential lending activities due to the unique characteristics of these markets.  ASB has been aggressively pursuing a strategy that includes expanding its commercial and commercial real estate lines of business. ASB's commercial real estate loan portfolio grew by 30% during 2015 and now comprises 15% of total loans. These types of loans generally entail higher underwriting and other service costs and present greater credit risks than traditional residential mortgages.Generally, both commercial and commercial real estate loans have shorter terms to maturity and earn higher spreads than residential mortgage loans. Only the assets of the business typically secure commercial loans. In such cases, upon default, any collateral repossessed may not be sufficient to repay the outstanding loan balance. In addition, loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and, thus, are more likely to be affected by current economic conditions and adverse business developments.ASB has grown its national syndicated lending portfolio where ASB is a participant in credit facilities agented by established and reputable national lenders. Management selectively chooses each deal based on conservative credit criteria to ensure a high quality, well diversified portfolio.Commercial real estate properties tend to be unique and are more difficult to value than residential real estate properties. Commercial real estate loans may not be fully amortizing, meaning that they may have a significant principal balance or “balloon” payment due at maturity. In addition, commercial real estate properties, particularly industrial and warehouse properties, are generally subject to relatively greater environmental risks than noncommercial properties and to the corresponding burdens and costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Also, there may be costs and delays involved in enforcing rights of a property owner against tenants in default under the terms of leases with respect to commercial properties. For example, a tenant may seek the protection of bankruptcy laws, which could result in termination of the tenant’s lease"
7,HE,HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC INDS,2015-02-26,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSThe businesses of HEI and its subsidiaries involve numerous risks which, if realized, could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements. In addition, there are numerous risks relating to the Merger and Spin-Off. For additional information for certain risk factors enumerated below and other risks of the Company and its operations, see “Forward-Looking Statements” above and HEI’s MD&A, HEI’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk”, the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Hawaiian Electric’s MD&A, Hawaiian Electric’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”Risk Factors
 Relating to the Merger. Failure to complete the Merger could negatively impact the stock price and the future business and financial results of HEI.  If the Merger is not completed, the ongoing business of HEI may be adversely affected and HEI will be subject to several risks, including the following:•having to pay certain costs relating to the proposed Merger and the Spin-Off, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor, filing, printing and mailing fees;•focusing HEI’s management on the Merger, which could lead to the disruption of HEI’s ongoing business or inconsistencies in its services, standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect the ability of HEI to maintain relationships with customers, regulators, vendors and employees, or could otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of HEI, without realizing any of the benefits of having the Merger completed; and•focusing HEI’s management on the Merger instead of on pursuing other opportunities that could be beneficial to HEI, without realizing any of the benefits of having the Merger completed.In addition to the above risks, HEI may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay to NEE a termination fee of $90 million, plus NEE’s expenses up to $5 million.If the Merger is not completed, HEI cannot assure its shareholders that these risks will not materialize and will not materially affect its business, financial results and stock price.The pendency of the Merger could adversely affect the business and operations of HEI.  In connection with the pending Merger, some customers or vendors of HEI’s utilities may delay or defer decisions, which could negatively impact the revenues, earnings, cash flows and expenses of HEI, regardless of whether the Merger is completed. Similarly, current and prospective employees of HEI and its utilities may experience uncertainty about their future roles following the Merger, which may materially adversely affect the ability of HEI and its utilities to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of the Merger. In addition, due to operating covenants in the Merger Agreement, HEI and its utilities may be unable, during the pendency of the Merger, to pursue strategic transactions, undertake significant capital projects, undertake certain significant financing or other specified transactions or pursue actions that are not in the ordinary course of business, even if such actions would prove beneficial.If the Merger is completed, NEE may be unable to successfully integrate HEI’s business.  NEE and HEI currently operate as independent public companies. After the Merger, NEE will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating HEI’s business. Potential difficulties NEE may encounter in the integration process include the following:•the complexities associated with integrating HEI and its utility business, while at the same time continuing to provide consistent, high quality services;•the additional complexities of integrating a company with different core services, markets and customers;•the inability to retain key employees;•unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the Merger; and•performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by completing the Merger and integrating HEI’s utility business.For these reasons, the integration process following the Merger could result in the distraction of NEE’s management, the disruption of NEE’s ongoing business or inconsistencies in its services, standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect the ability of NEE to maintain relationships with customers, vendors and employees or could otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of NEE.HEI may be materially adversely affected by negative publicity related to the proposed Merger and in connection with other matters.  From time to time, political and public sentiment in connection with the proposed Merger and in connection with other matters may result in a significant amount of adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting NEE and HEI. Adverse press coverage and other adverse statements, whether or not driven by political or public sentiment, 26may also result in investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in legal claims. Responding to these investigations and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding, can divert the time and effort of senior management from the management of HEI’s businesses.Addressing any adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny or enforcement or other legal proceedings is time consuming and expensive and, regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made, can have a negative impact on HEI’s reputation, on the morale and performance of its employees and on its relationships with its regulators. It may also have a negative impact on HEI’s ability to take timely advantage of various business and market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects of negative publicity, and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may have a material adverse effect on HEI’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Pending litigation against HEI and NEE could result in an injunction preventing completion of the merger, the payment of damages in the event the merger is completed and/or may adversely affect the combined company's business, financial condition or results of operations following the Merger. Holding Company and Company-Wide Risks.HEI is a holding company that derives its income from its operating subsidiaries and depends on the ability of those subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI and on its own ability to raise capital.  HEI is a legal entity separate and distinct from its various subsidiaries. As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, HEI’s cash flows and consequent ability to service its obligations and pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon its receipt of dividends or other distributions from its operating subsidiaries and its ability to issue common stock or other equity securities and to incur additional debt. The ability of HEI’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI, in turn, is subject to the risks associated with their operations and to contractual and regulatory restrictions, including:•the provisions of an HEI agreement with the PUC, which could limit the ability of HEI’s principal electric public utility subsidiary, Hawaiian Electric, to pay dividends to HEI in the event that the consolidated common stock equity of the Utilities falls below 35% of total capitalization of the electric utilities;•the provisions of an HEI agreement entered into with federal bank regulators in connection with its acquisition of its bank subsidiary, ASB, which require HEI to contribute additional capital to ASB (up to a maximum amount of additional capital of $28.3 million as of December 31, 2014) upon request of the regulators in order to maintain ASB’s regulatory capital at the level required by regulation;•the minimum capital and capital distribution regulations of the OCC that are applicable to ASB and capital regulations that become applicable to HEI and ASB Hawaii;•the receipt of a letter of non-objection or prior approval from the OCC and FRB to the payment of any dividend ASB proposes to declare and pay to ASB Hawaii and HEI; and•the provisions of preferred stock resolutions and debt instruments of HEI and its subsidiaries.The Company is subject to risks associated with the Hawaii economy (in the aggregate and on an individual island basis), volatile U.S. capital markets and changes in the interest rate and credit market environment that have and/or could result in higher retirement benefit plan funding requirements, declines in electric utility KWH sales, declines in ASB’s interest rate margins and investment values, higher delinquencies and charge-offs in ASB’s loan portfolio and restrictions on the ability of HEI or its subsidiaries to borrow money or issue securities.  The two largest components of Hawaii’s economy are tourism and the federal government (including the military). Because the core businesses of HEI’s subsidiaries are providing local public electric utility services (through Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries) and banking services (through ASB) in Hawaii, the Company’s operating results are significantly influenced by Hawaii’s economy, which in turn is influenced by economic conditions in the mainland U.S. (particularly California) and Asia (particularly Japan) as a result of the impact of those conditions on tourism, by the impact of interest rates on the construction and real estate industries and by the impact of world conditions (e.g., U.S. withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan) on federal government spending in Hawaii. For example, the turmoil in the financial markets and declines in the national and global economies had a negative effect on the Hawaii economy in 2009. In 2009, declines in the Hawaii, U.S. and Asian economies in part led to declines in KWH sales, an increase in uncollected billings of the Utilities, higher delinquencies in ASB’s loan portfolio and other adverse effects on HEI’s businesses.If Fitch, Moody's or S&P were to downgrade HEI’s or Hawaiian Electric’s long-term debt ratings because of past adverse effects, or if future events were to adversely affect the availability of capital to the Company, HEI’s and Hawaiian Electric’s ability to borrow and raise capital could be constrained and their future borrowing costs would likely increase with resulting reductions in HEI’s consolidated net income in future periods. Further, if HEI’s or Hawaiian Electric’s commercial paper ratings were to be downgraded, HEI and Hawaiian Electric might not be able to sell commercial paper and might be required to draw on more expensive bank lines of credit or to defer capital or other expenditures.Changes in the U.S. capital markets can also have significant effects on the Company. For example, pension funding requirements are affected by the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for pension plans, and 27by the discount rate used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost and value obligations. The Utilities’ pension tracking mechanisms help moderate pension expense; however, the significant decline in 2008 in the value of the Company’s defined benefit pension plan assets resulted in a substantial gap between the projected benefit obligations under the plans and the value of plan assets, resulting in increases in funding requirements. The increases have moderated in recent years as investment performance has improved.Because the earnings of ASB depend primarily on net interest income, interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASB’s operations. HEI and the Utilities are also exposed to interest rate risk primarily due to their periodic borrowing requirements, the discount rate used to determine pension funding requirements and the possible effect of interest rates on the electric utilities’ rates of return. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors, including general economic conditions and the policies of government and regulatory authorities. HEI cannot predict future changes in interest rates, nor be certain that interest rate risk management strategies it or its subsidiaries have implemented will be successful in managing interest rate risk.Interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting the fair value of ASB’s investment securities. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair values of those instruments, respectively. Disruptions in the credit markets, a liquidity crisis in the banking industry or increased levels of residential mortgage delinquencies and defaults may result in decreases in the fair value of ASB’s investment securities and an impairment that is other-than-temporary, requiring ASB to write down its investment securities. As of December 31, 2014, all of ASB’s investment securities were securities and obligations issued by a federal agency or government sponsored entity that have an implicit guarantee from the U.S. government.HEI and Hawaiian Electric and their subsidiaries may incur higher retirement benefits expenses and have and will likely continue to recognize substantial liabilities for retirement benefits.  Retirement benefits expenses and cash funding requirements could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the U.S. equity markets, trends in interest rates and health care costs, plan amendments, new laws relating to pension funding and changes in accounting principles. For the Utilities, however, retirement benefits expenses, as adjusted by the pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions (OPEB) tracking mechanisms, have been an allowable expense for rate-making purposes.The Company is subject to the risks associated with the geographic concentration of its businesses and current lack of interconnections that could result in service interruptions at the Utilities or higher default rates on loans held by ASB.  The business of the Utilities is concentrated on the individual islands they serve in the State of Hawaii. Their operations are more vulnerable to service interruptions than are many U.S. mainland utilities because none of the systems of the Utilities are interconnected with the systems on the other islands they serve. Because of this lack of interconnections, it is necessary to maintain higher generation reserve margins than are typical for U.S. mainland utilities to help ensure reliable service. Service interruptions, including in particular extended interruptions that could result from a natural disaster or terrorist activity, could adversely impact the KWH sales of some or all of the Utilities.Substantially all of ASB’s consumer loan customers are Hawaii residents. A significant portion of the commercial loan customers are located in Hawaii. While a majority of customers are on Oahu, ASB also has customers on the neighbor islands (whose economies have been weaker than Oahu during the recent economic downturn). Substantially all of the real estate underlying ASB’s residential and commercial real estate loans are located in Hawaii. These assets may be subject to a greater risk of default than other comparable assets held by financial institutions with other geographic concentrations in the event of adverse economic, political or business developments or natural disasters affecting Hawaii and the ability of ASB’s customers to make payments of principal and interest on their loans.Increasing competition and technological advances could cause HEI’s businesses to lose customers or render their operations obsolete.  The banking industry in Hawaii, and certain aspects of the electric utility industry, are competitive. The success of HEI’s subsidiaries in meeting competition and responding to technological advances will continue to have a direct impact on HEI’s consolidated financial performance. For example:•ASB, one of the largest financial institutions in the state, is in direct competition for deposits and loans not only with two larger institutions that have substantial capital, technology and marketing resources, but also with smaller Hawaii institutions and other U.S. institutions, including credit unions, mutual funds, mortgage brokers, finance companies and investment banking firms. Larger financial institutions may have greater access to capital at lower costs, which could impair ASB’s ability to compete effectively. Significant advances in technology could render the operations of ASB less competitive or obsolete.•The Utilities face competition from IPPs; customer self-generation, with or without cogeneration; customer energy storage; and the potential formation of community-based, cooperative ownership structures for electrical service on the neighbor islands.  With the exception of certain identified projects, the Utilities are required to use competitive bidding to acquire a future generation resource unless the PUC finds competitive bidding to be unsuitable. The PUC set policies for distributed generation (DG) interconnection agreements and standby rates, and established conditions 28under which electric utilities can provide DG services on customer-owned sites as a regulated service. The results of competitive bidding, competition from IPPs, customer self-generation, and potential cooperative ownership structures for electric utility service, and the rate at which technological developments facilitating nonutility generation of electricity and customer energy storage occur may adversely affect the Utilities and the results of their operations. •New technological developments, such as the commercial development of energy storage and microgrids, may render the operations of the Utilities less competitive or outdated.The Company may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security that could adversely affect its businesses and reputation.  The Company is subject to cyber security risks and the potential for cyber incidents, including potential incidents at ASB branches and at the the Utilities' plants and the related electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure, and incidents at data processing centers they use, to the extent not prevented by intrusion detection and prevention systems, anti-virus software, firewalls and other general information technology controls. ASB and the Utilities are highly dependent on their ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions. ASB and the Utilities rely heavily on numerous data processing systems. If any of these systems fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time, the Company could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to its reputation. The Utilities and ASB have disaster recovery plans in place to protect their businesses against natural disasters, security breaches, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures or similar events. The disaster recovery plans, however, may not be successful in preventing the loss of customer data, service interruptions, disruptions to operations or damage to important facilities.HEI’s businesses could suffer losses that are uninsured due to a lack of affordable insurance coverage, unavailability of insurance coverage or limitations on the insurance coverage the Company does have.  In the ordinary course of business, HEI and its subsidiaries purchase insurance coverages (e.g., property and liability coverages) to protect against loss of, or damage to, their properties and against claims made by third parties and employees for property damage or personal injuries. However, the protection provided by such insurance is limited in significant respects and, in some instances, there is no coverage. Certain of the insurance has substantial deductibles or has limits on the maximum amounts that may be recovered. For example, the Utilities’ overhead and underground transmission and distribution systems (with the exception of substation buildings and contents) have a replacement value roughly estimated at $6 billion and are largely not insured against loss or damage because the amount of transmission and distribution system insurance available is limited and the premiums are cost prohibitive. Similarly, the Utilities have no business interruption insurance as the premiums for such insurance would be cost prohibitive, particularly since the Utilities are not interconnected to other systems. If a hurricane or other uninsured catastrophic natural disaster were to occur, and if the PUC were not to allow the affected Utilities to recover from ratepayers restoration costs and revenues lost from business interruption, the lost revenues and repair expenses could result in a significant decrease in HEI’s consolidated net income or in significant net losses for the affected periods.ASB generally does not obtain credit enhancements, such as mortgagor bankruptcy insurance, but does require standard hazard and hurricane insurance and may require flood insurance for certain properties. ASB is subject to the risks of borrower defaults and bankruptcies, special hazard losses not covered by the required insurance and the insurance company’s inability to pay claims on existing policies.Increased federal and state environmental regulation will require an increasing commitment of resources and funds and could result in construction delays or penalties and fines for non-compliance. HEI and its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, hazardous substances, waste management, natural resources and health and safety, which regulate, among other matters, the operation of existing facilities, the construction and operation of new facilities and the proper cleanup and disposal of hazardous and toxic wastes and substances. HEI or its subsidiaries are currently involved in investigatory or remedial actions at current, former or third-party sites and there is no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs relating to these sites. In addition, compliance with these legal requirements requires the Utilities to commit significant resources and funds toward, among other things, environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment and payment of emission fees. These laws and regulations, among other things, require that certain environmental permits be obtained in order to construct or operate certain facilities, and obtaining such permits can entail significant expense and cause substantial construction delays. Also, these laws and regulations may be amended from time to time, including amendments that increase the burden and expense of compliance. For example, emission and/or discharge limits may be tightened, more extensive permitting requirements may be imposed and additional substances may become regulated. In addition, significant regulatory uncertainty exists regarding the impact of federal or state greenhouse gas (GHG) emission limits and reductions.If HEI or its subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond their control, that failure may result in civil or criminal penalties and fines or the cessation of operations.29Adverse tax rulings or developments could result in significant increases in tax payments and/or expense.  Governmental taxing authorities could challenge a tax return position taken by HEI or its subsidiaries and, if the taxing authorities prevail, HEI’s consolidated tax payments and/or expense, including applicable penalties and interest, could increase significantly.The Company could be subject to the risk of uninsured losses in excess of its accruals for litigation matters.  HEI and its subsidiaries are involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of their businesses, most of which is covered by insurance (subject to policy limits and deductibles). However, other litigation may arise that is not routine (such as the litigation related to the proposed Merger) or involves claims that may not be covered by insurance. Because of the uncertainties associated with litigation, there is a risk that litigation against HEI or its subsidiaries, even if vigorously defended, could result in costs of defense and judgment or settlement amounts not covered by insurance and in excess of reserves established in HEI’s consolidated financial statements.Changes in accounting principles and estimates could affect the reported amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities or revenues and expenses.  HEI’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Changes in accounting principles (including the possible adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards or new U.S. accounting standards), or changes in the Company’s application of existing accounting principles, could materially affect the financial statement presentation of HEI’s or the Utilities’ consolidated results of operations and/or financial condition. Further, in preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the amounts reported for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; contingencies and litigation; income taxes; property, plant and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; electric utility revenues; allowance for loan losses; nonperforming loans; troubled debt restructurings; and fair value.The Utilities' financial statements reflect assets and costs based on cost-based rate-making regulations. Continued accounting in this manner requires that certain criteria relating to the recoverability of such costs through rates be met. If events or circumstances should change so that the criteria are no longer satisfied, the Utilities’ expect that their regulatory assets (amounting to $905 million as of December 31, 2014), net of regulatory liabilities (amounting to $345 million as of December 31, 2014), would be charged to the statement of income in the period of discontinuance. Changes in accounting principles can also impact HEI’s consolidated financial statements. For example, if management determines that a PPA requires the consolidation of the IPP in the Consolidated Financial Statements, the consolidation could have a material effect on Hawaiian Electric’s and HEI’s consolidated financial statements, including the recognition of a significant amount of assets and liabilities and, if such a consolidated IPP were operating at a loss and had insufficient equity, the potential recognition of such losses. Also, if management determines that a PPA requires the classification of the agreement as a capital lease, a material effect on HEI’s consolidated balance sheet may result, including the recognition of significant capital assets and lease obligations.A proposed standard on accounting for expected credit losses was issued by the FASB which would replace existing impairment models, including replacing an “incurred loss” model for loans with a “current expected credit loss” model. There are a number of questions and issues around the expected credit loss model. ASB cannot predict whether or when a final standard will be issued, when it will be effective or what it its final provisions will be. It is possible that the final standard could have a material adverse impact on the bank’s results of operations once it is issued and becomes effective.A standard on accounting for revenues from contracts with customers was issued by the FASB in May 2014. The Company plans to adopt this standard in the first quarter of 2017, but has not determined the impact of adoption on its financial statements.Electric Utility Risks.Actions of the PUC are outside the control of the Utilities and could result in inadequate or untimely rate increases, in rate reductions or refunds or in unanticipated delays, expenses or writedowns in connection with the construction of new projects.  The rates the Utilities are allowed to charge for their services and the timeliness of permitted rate increases are among the most important items influencing the Utilities’ results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The PUC has broad discretion over the rates that the Utilities charge their customers. As part of the decoupling mechanism that the Utilities have implemented, each of the Utilities will file a rate case once every three years. Any adverse decision by the PUC concerning the level or method of determining electric utility rates, the items and amounts that may be included in rate base, the returns on equity or rate base found to be reasonable, the potential consequences of exceeding or not meeting such returns, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding could have a material adverse effect on Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.30To improve the timing and certainty of the recovery of their costs, the Utilities have proposed and received approval of various cost recovery mechanisms including an ECAC and pension and OPEB tracking mechanisms, as well as a decoupling mechanism, a PPAC, and a renewable energy infrastructure program (REIP) surcharge. A change in, or the elimination of, any of these cost recovery mechanisms, including in the current proceeding in which the PUC is examining the decoupling mechanism, could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities.The Utilities could be required to refund to their customers, with interest, revenues that have been or may be received under interim rate orders in their rate case proceedings, integrated resource plan cost recovery dockets and other proceedings, if and to the extent they exceed the amounts allowed in final orders.Many public utility projects require PUC approval and various permits (e.g., environmental and land use permits) from other governmental agencies. Difficulties in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, the necessary approvals or permits, or any adverse decision or policy made or adopted, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision, by an agency with respect to such approvals and permits, can result in significantly increased project costs or even cancellation of projects. In the event a project does not proceed, or if the PUC disallows cost recovery for all or part of a project, project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could result in significant reductions in Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated net income. For example, in January 2013, the Utilities and the Consumer Advocate signed a settlement agreement to write off $40 million of costs in lieu of conducting PUC-ordered regulatory audits of the CIP CT-1 and the CIS projects. Energy cost adjustment clauses. The rate schedules of each of the Utilities include ECACs under which electric rates charged to customers are automatically adjusted for changes in the weighted-average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power, and the relative amounts of company-generated power and purchased power.ECACs are subject to periodic review by the PUC. As part of the review, the Energy Agreement had provided that the PUC may examine whether there are renewable energy projects from which the Utilities should have, but did not, purchase energy or whether alternative fuel purchase strategies were appropriately used or not used.In the most recent rate cases, the PUC allowed the current ECAC to continue. However, in the decoupling reexamination proceeding, certain parties recommended modifying the ECAC to allow only partial pass-through of fuel costs and eventual phasing out of the ECAC. The Consumer Advocate stated that there should be no significant change to the existing ECAC without first undertaking a new regulatory proceeding that would provide time and resources for the careful study of the potential effects of each ECAC change considered, but that there should be significantly greater ECAC audit and regulatory review of the Utilities’ incurred fuel costs should be implemented to encourage cost control and to identify and deny recovery of any imprudently incurred energy costs through the ECAC. The Utilities suggested ways of improving the ECAC but stated that the partial pass through of fuel costs would not be proper regulatory policy since the Utilities have no control over world oil markets, that 42 of the 50 states provide dollar-for-dollar pass through of market-driven changes in fuel or purchase power costs, and that modifying the ECAC to allow only partial pass-through of fuel costs could severely impact the Utilities’ credit rating. A change in, or the elimination of, the ECAC could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities.Electric utility operations are significantly influenced by weather conditions.  The Utilities’ results of operations can be affected by the weather. Weather conditions, particularly temperature and humidity, directly influence the demand for electricity. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis and lightning storms, which may become more severe or frequent as a result of global climate changes, can cause outages and property damage and require the Utilities to incur significant additional expenses that may not be recoverable.Electric utility operations depend heavily on third-party suppliers of fuel and purchased power.  The Utilities rely on fuel oil suppliers and shippers and IPPs to deliver fuel oil and power, respectively, in accordance with contractual agreements. Approximately 69% of the net energy generated or purchased by the Utilities in 2014 was generated from the burning of fossil fuel oil, and purchases of power by the Utilities provided about 46% of their total net energy generated and purchased for the same period. Failure or delay by oil suppliers and shippers to provide fuel pursuant to existing contracts, or failure by a major IPP to deliver the firm capacity anticipated in its PPA, could disrupt the ability of the Utilities to deliver electricity and require the Utilities to incur additional expenses to meet the needs of their customers that may not be recoverable. In addition, as the IPP contracts near the end of their terms, there may be less economic incentive for the IPPs to make investments in their units to ensure the availability of their units. Also, as these contractual agreements end, the Utilities may not be able to purchase fuel and power on terms equivalent to the current contractual agreements. As the use of biofuels in generating units increases, the same risks will exist with suppliers of biofuels.Electric utility generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated and/or increased operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs.  Operation of electric generating facilities involves certain risks which can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels. Included among these risks are facility shutdowns or power interruptions due to insufficient generation or a breakdown or failure of 31equipment or processes.  In January 2015, Hawaiian Electric experienced a generation shortfall event due to unexpected concurrent outages of a utility generating unit and several IPPs.  In addition, operations could be negatively impacted by interruptions in fuel supply, inability to negotiate satisfactory collective bargaining agreements when existing agreements expire or other labor disputes, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements, disruptions in delivery of electricity, operator error and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, fires, explosions, floods or other similar occurrences affecting the Utilities’ generating facilities or transmission and distribution systems.The Utilities may be adversely affected by new legislation.  Congress, the Hawaii legislature and governmental agencies periodically consider legislation and other initiatives that could have uncertain or negative effects on the Utilities and their customers. Congress, the Hawaii legislature and governmental agencies have adopted, or are considering adopting, a number of measures that will significantly affect the Utilities, as described below.Renewable Portfolio Standards law.  In 2009, Hawaii’s RPS law was amended to require electric utilities to meet an RPS of 10%, 15%, 25% and 40% by December 31, 2010, 2015, 2020 and 2030, respectively. Energy savings resulting from energy efficiency programs do not count toward the RPS after 2014. The Utilities are committed to achieving these goals and met the 2010 RPS; however, due to the exclusion of energy savings in calculating RPS after 2014 and risks such as potential delays in IPPs being able to deliver contracted renewable energy, it is possible the Utilities may not attain the required renewable percentages in the future, and management cannot predict the future consequences of failure to do so (including potential penalties to be assessed by the PUC). On December 19, 2008, the PUC approved a penalty of $20 for every MWh that an electric utility is deficient under Hawaii’s RPS law. The PUC noted, however, that this penalty may be reduced, in the PUC’s discretion, due to events or circumstances that are outside an electric utility’s reasonable control, to the extent the event or circumstance could not be reasonably foreseen and ameliorated, as described in the RPS law and in an RPS framework adopted by the PUC. In addition, the PUC ordered that the Utilities will be prohibited from recovering any RPS penalty costs through rates.Renewable energy.  In 2007, a measure was passed by the Hawaii legislature stating that the PUC may consider the need for increased renewable energy in rendering decisions on utility matters. Due to this measure, it is possible that, if energy from a renewable source is more expensive than energy from fossil fuel, the PUC may still approve the purchase of energy from the renewable source, resulting in higher costs.Global climate change and greenhouse gas emissions reduction.  National and international concern about climate change and the contribution of GHG emissions to climate change have led to action by the state of Hawaii and federal legislative and regulatory proposals to reduce GHG emissions.In July 2007, Act 234, which requires a statewide reduction of GHG emissions by January 1, 2020 to levels at or below the statewide GHG emission levels in 1990, became law in Hawaii. On June 20, 2014, the Governor signed the final regulations required to implement Act 234 and the regulations went into effect on June 30, 2014. In general, the regulations require affected sources that have the potential to emit GHGs in excess of established thresholds to reduce GHG emissions by 16% below 2010 emission levels by 2020. The regulations will also assess affected sources an annual fee based on tons per year of GHG emissions commencing on the effective date of the regulations, estimated to be approximately $0.5 million annually for the Utilities. The DOH GHG regulations also track the federal “Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule” (GHG Tailoring Rule, see below) and would create new thresholds for GHG emissions from new and existing stationary source facilities. Several approaches to GHG emission reduction (including “cap and trade”) have been either introduced or discussed in Congress; however, no legislation has yet been enacted.In response to the 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, which ruled that the EPA has the authority to regulate GHG emissions from motor vehicles under the CAA, the EPA has accelerated rulemaking addressing GHG emissions from both mobile and stationary sources. On September 22, 2009, the EPA issued the Final Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule. The rule, which applies to the Utilities, requires that sources above certain threshold levels monitor and report GHG emissions.On June 3, 2010, the EPA’s final GHG Tailoring Rule was published. It created a new emissions threshold for GHG emissions from new and existing facilities and requires certain facilities to obtain PSD and Title V operating permits. On June 23, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision that invalidated the GHG Tailoring Rule, to the extent it regulated sources based solely on their GHG emissions. It also invalidated the GHG emissions threshold for regulation. On December 19, 2014, EPA released two memorandums outlining the Agency’s plan for addressing the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision. Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric are evaluating the potential impacts of the Agency’s plan on utility operations and permitting. The current status of the GHG Tailoring Rule, and any further regulatory action the EPA may take in light of this recent decision, are uncertain. 32On January 8, 2014, the EPA published in the Federal Register its new proposal for New Source Performance Standards for GHG from new generating units. The proposed rule on GHG from new EGUs does not apply to oil- fired combustion turbines or diesel engine generators, and is not otherwise expected to have significant impacts on the Utilities.On June 18, 2014, the EPA published in the Federal Register its proposed rule for GHG emissions from existing power plants. The rule sets interim and final state-wide, state-specific emission performance goals, expressed as lb CO2/MWh, that would apply to the state’s affected sources. The interim goal would apply as an average over the period 2020 through 2029, with the final goal to be met by 2030. On the same date, the EPA also published a separate rule for modified and reconstructed power plants. The EPA’s plan is to issue the final rules by mid-summer 2015. Hawaiian Electric is still evaluating the proposed rules for GHG emissions from existing, modified, and reconstructed sources, and how they might relate to the recently issued State GHG rules. Hawaiian Electric will participate in the federal GHG rulemaking process, and in the implementation of the State GHG rules, to try to reconcile federal GHG regulation, state GHG regulation, and any action the EPA may take as a result of the recent U.S. Supreme Court opinion, to facilitate clear and cost-effective compliance. The Utilities will continue to evaluate the impact of proposed GHG rules and regulations as they develop. Final regulations may impose significant compliance costs, and may require reductions in fossil fuel use and the addition of renewable energy resources in excess of the requirements of the RPS law. While the timing, extent and ultimate effects of climate change cannot be determined with any certainty, climate change is predicted to result in sea level rise, which could potentially impact coastal and other low-lying areas (where much of the Utilities’ electric infrastructure is sited), and could cause erosion of beaches, saltwater intrusion into aquifers and surface ecosystems, higher water tables and increased flooding and storm damage due to heavy rainfall. The effects of climate change on the weather (for example, floods or hurricanes), sea levels, and water availability and quality have the potential to materially adversely affect the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities. For example, severe weather could cause significant harm to the Utilities’ physical facilities. The Utilities have taken, and continue to identify opportunities to take, direct action to reduce GHG emissions from their operations, including, but not limited to, supporting DSM programs that foster energy efficiency, using renewable resources for energy production and purchasing power from IPPs generated by renewable resources, burning renewable biodiesel in Hawaiian Electric’s CIP CT-1, using biodiesel for startup and shutdown of selected Maui Electric generating units, and testing biofuel blends in other Hawaiian Electric and Maui Electric generating units. The Utilities are also working with the State of Hawaii and other entities to pursue the use of liquefied natural gas as a cleaner and lower cost fuel to replace, at least in part, the petroleum oil that would otherwise be used. Management is unable to evaluate the ultimate impact on the Utilities of these various measures to reduce GHG emissions.The foregoing legislation or legislation that now is, or may in the future be, proposed present risks and uncertainties for the Utilities.The Utilities may be subject to increased operational challenges and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely impacted in meeting the commitments and objectives of clean energy initiatives and Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS).  The far-reaching nature of the Utilities' renewable energy commitments and the RPS goals present risks to the Company. Among such risks are: (1) the dependence on third party suppliers of renewable purchased energy, which if the Utilities are unsuccessful in negotiating purchased power agreements with such IPPs or if a major IPP fails to deliver the anticipated capacity in its purchased power agreement, could impact the Utilities’ achievement of their commitments to RPS goals and/or the Utilities’ ability to deliver reliable service; (2) delays in acquiring or unavailability of non-fossil fuel supplies for renewable generation; (3) the impact of intermittent power to the electrical grid and reliability of service if appropriate supporting infrastructure is not installed or does not operate effectively; (4) the likelihood that the Utilities may need to make substantial investments in related infrastructure, which could result in increased borrowings and, therefore, materially impact the financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities; and (5) the commitment to support a variety of initiatives, which, if approved by the PUC, may have a material impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the Utilities depending on their design and implementation. Bank Risks.Fluctuations in interest rates could result in lower net interest income, impair ASB’s ability to originate new loans or impair the ability of ASB’s adjustable-rate borrowers to make increased payments.  Interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASB’s operations. ASB’s net interest income consists primarily of interest income received on fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, mortgage-related securities and investments and interest expense consisting primarily of interest paid on deposits and other borrowings. Interest rate risk arises when earning assets mature or when their interest rates change in a time frame different from that of the costing liabilities. Changes in market interest rates, including changes in the relationship between short-term and long-term market interest rates or between different interest rate indices, can impact ASB’s net interest margin.33Although ASB pursues an asset-liability management strategy designed to mitigate its risk from changes in market interest rates, unfavorable movements in interest rates could result in lower net interest income. Residential 1-4 family fixed-rate mortgage loans comprised about 43% of ASB’s loan portfolio as of December 31, 2014 and do not re-price with movements in interest rates. ASB continues to face a challenging interest rate environment. Interest rates declined in 2014 and new loan production rates remained at historically low levels and below ASB's loan portfolio yields. This placed additional pressure on ASB's asset yields and net interest margin. The degree to which compression of ASB's margin continues is uncertain if interest rates rise.Increases in market interest rates could have an adverse impact on ASB’s cost of funds. Higher market interest rates could lead to higher interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Significant increases in market interest rates, or the perception that an increase may occur, could adversely affect ASB’s ability to originate new loans and grow. An increase in market interest rates, especially a sudden increase, could also adversely affect the ability of ASB’s adjustable-rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations. If this occurred, it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets and charge-offs. Conversely, a decrease in interest rates or a mismatching of maturities of interest sensitive financial instruments could result in an acceleration in the prepayment of loans and mortgage-related securities and impact ASB’s ability to reinvest its liquidity in similar yielding assets. ASB’s operations are affected by many disparate factors, some of which are beyond its control, that could result in lower net interest income or decreased demand for its products and services.  ASB’s results of operations depend primarily on the level of interest income generated by ASB’s earning assets in excess of the interest expense on its costing liabilities and the supply of and demand for its products and services (i.e., loans and deposits). ASB’s net income may also be adversely affected by various other factors, such as:•local and other economic and political conditions that could result in declines in employment and real estate values, which in turn could adversely affect the ability of borrowers to make loan payments and the ability of ASB to recover the full amounts owing to it under defaulted loans;•the ability of borrowers to obtain insurance and the ability of ASB to place insurance where borrowers fail to do so, particularly in the event of catastrophic damage to collateral securing loans made by ASB;•faster than expected loan prepayments that can cause an acceleration of the amortization of premiums on loans and investments and the impairment of mortgage servicing assets of ASB;•changes in ASB’s loan portfolio credit profiles and asset quality, which may increase or decrease the required level of allowance for loan losses;•technological disruptions affecting ASB’s operations or financial or operational difficulties experienced by any outside vendor on whom ASB relies to provide key components of its business operations, such as business processing, network access or internet connections;•the impact of legislative and regulatory changes affecting capital requirements and increasing oversight of, and reporting by, banks;•additional legislative changes regulating the assessment of overdraft, interchange and credit card fees, which will have a negative impact on noninterest income;•public opinion about ASB and financial institutions in general, which, if negative, could impact the public’s trust and confidence in ASB and adversely affect ASB’s ability to attract and retain customers and expose ASB to adverse legal and regulatory consequences;•increases in operating costs (including employee compensation expense and benefits), inflation and other factors, that exceed increases in ASB’ s net interest, fee and other income; and•the ability of ASB to maintain or increase the level of deposits, ASB’s lowest costing funds.Banking and related regulations could result in significant restrictions being imposed on ASB’s business or in a requirement that HEI divest ASB.  ASB is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the Department of Treasury, the OCC and the FDIC, and is subject to reserve requirements established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In addition, the FRB is responsible for regulating ASB’s holding companies, HEI and ASB Hawaii. The regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies to address not only ASB’s compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations, but also capital adequacy, asset quality, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity and various other factors.Under certain circumstances, including any determination that ASB’s relationship with HEI results in an unsafe and unsound banking practice, these regulatory authorities have the authority to restrict the ability of ASB to transfer assets and to make distributions to its shareholders (including payment of dividends to HEI), or they could seek to require HEI to sever its relationship with or divest its ownership of ASB. Payment by ASB of dividends to HEI may also be restricted by the OCC and FRB under its prompt corrective action regulations or its capital distribution regulations if ASB’s capital position deteriorates. In order to maintain its status as a QTL, ASB is required to maintain at least 65% of its assets in “qualified thrift investments.” Institutions that fail to maintain QTL status are subject to various penalties, including limitations on their activities. In ASB’s 34case, the activities of HEI and HEI’s other subsidiaries would also be subject to restrictions, and a failure or inability to comply with those restrictions could effectively result in the required divestiture of ASB. Federal legislation has also been proposed in the past that could result in a required divestiture of ASB. In the event of a required divestiture, federal law substantially limits the types of entities that could potentially acquire ASB.Recent legislative and regulatory initiatives could have an adverse effect on ASB’s business.  The Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July 2010, has had a substantial impact on the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes a framework through which regulatory reform will be written and changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies could affect HEI and ASB in substantial and unpredictable ways. A major component of the Dodd-Frank Act is the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that has the responsibility for setting and enforcing clear, consistent rules relating to consumer financial products and services and has the authority to prohibit practices it finds to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. Compliance with any such directives could have adverse effects on ASB’s revenues or operating costs. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on ASB’s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.A large percentage of ASB’s loans and securities are collateralized by real estate, and adverse changes in the real estate market and/or general economic or other conditions may result in loan losses and adversely affect the Company’s profitability.  As of December 31, 2014 approximately 79% of ASB’s loan portfolio was comprised of loans primarily collateralized by real estate, most of which was concentrated in the State of Hawaii. ASB’s HELOC (home equity line of credit) portfolio grew by 11% during 2014 and now comprises 23% of total real estate loans. ASB’s financial results may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions, either nationally or in the state of Hawaii, including decreases in real estate values, adverse employment conditions, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal and state government and other significant external events. Adverse changes in the economy may have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans. A deterioration of the economic environment in Hawaii, including a material decline in the real estate market, further declines in home resales, or a material external shock, or any environmental clean-up obligation, may also significantly impair the value of ASB’s collateral and ASB’s ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. In the event of a default, amounts received upon sale of the collateral may be insufficient to recover outstanding principal and interest. In addition, if poor economic conditions result in decreased demand for real estate loans, ASB’s profits may decrease if its alternative investments earn less income than real estate loans.ASB’s strategy to expand its commercial and commercial real estate lending activities may result in higher service costs and greater credit risk than residential lending activities due to the unique characteristics of these markets.  ASB has been aggressively pursuing a strategy that includes expanding its commercial and commercial real estate lines of business. These types of loans generally entail higher underwriting and other service costs and present greater credit risks than traditional residential mortgages.Generally, both commercial and commercial real estate loans have shorter terms to maturity and earn higher spreads than residential mortgage loans. Only the assets of the business typically secure commercial loans. In such cases, upon default, any collateral repossessed may not be sufficient to repay the outstanding loan balance. In addition, loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and, thus, are more likely to be affected by current economic conditions and adverse business developments.ASB has grown its national syndicated lending portfolio where ASB is a participant in credit facilities agented by established and reputable national lenders. Management selectively chooses each deal based on conservative credit criteria to ensure a high quality, well diversified portfolio.Commercial real estate properties tend to be unique and are more difficult to value than residential real estate properties. Commercial real estate loans may not be fully amortizing, meaning that they may have a significant principal balance or “balloon” payment due at maturity. In addition, commercial real estate properties, particularly industrial and warehouse properties, are generally subject to relatively greater environmental risks than noncommercial properties and to the corresponding burdens and costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Also, there may be costs and delays involved in enforcing rights of a property owner against tenants in default under the terms of leases with respect to commercial properties. For example, a tenant may seek the protection of bankruptcy laws, which could result in termination of the tenant’s lease"
10,HE,HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC INDS,2014-02-21,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSThe businesses of HEI and its subsidiaries involve numerous risks which, if realized, could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements. For additional information for certain risk factors enumerated below and other risks of the Company and its operations, see “Forward-Looking Statements” above and HEI’s MD&A, HEI’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk”, the Consolidated Financial Statements, Hawaiian Electric’s MD&A, Hawaiian Electric’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”Holding Company and Company-Wide Risks.HEI is a holding company that derives its income from its operating subsidiaries and depends on the ability of those subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI and on its own ability to raise capital.  HEI is a legal entity separate and distinct from its various subsidiaries. As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, HEI’s cash flows and consequent ability to service its obligations and pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon its receipt of dividends or other distributions from its operating subsidiaries and its ability to issue common stock or other equity securities and to incur additional debt. The ability of HEI’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI, in turn, is subject to the risks associated with their operations and to contractual and regulatory restrictions, including:24•the provisions of an HEI agreement with the PUC, which could limit the ability of HEI’s principal electric public utility subsidiary, Hawaiian Electric, to pay dividends to HEI in the event that the consolidated common stock equity of the Utilities falls below 35% of total capitalization of the electric utilities;•the provisions of an HEI agreement entered into with federal bank regulators in connection with its acquisition of its bank subsidiary, ASB, which require HEI to contribute additional capital to ASB (up to a maximum amount of additional capital of $28.3 million as of December 31, 2013) upon request of the regulators in order to maintain ASB’s regulatory capital at the level required by regulation;•the minimum capital and capital distribution regulations of the OCC that are applicable to ASB and capital regulations that become applicable to HEI and ASHI;•the receipt of a letter of non-objection or prior approval from the OCC and FRB to the payment of any dividend ASB proposes to declare and pay to ASHI and HEI; and•the provisions of preferred stock resolutions and debt instruments of HEI and its subsidiaries.The Company is subject to risks associated with the Hawaii economy (in the aggregate and on an individual island basis), volatile U.S. capital markets and changes in the interest rate and credit market environment that have and/or could result in higher retirement benefit plan funding requirements, declines in electric utility KWH sales, declines in ASB’s interest rate margins and investment values, higher delinquencies and charge-offs in ASB’s loan portfolio and restrictions on the ability of HEI or its subsidiaries to borrow money or issue securities.  The two largest components of Hawaii’s economy are tourism and the federal government (including the military). Because the core businesses of HEI’s subsidiaries are providing local public electric utility services (through Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries) and banking services (through ASB) in Hawaii, the Company’s operating results are significantly influenced by Hawaii’s economy, which in turn is influenced by economic conditions in the mainland U.S. (particularly California) and Asia (particularly Japan) as a result of the impact of those conditions on tourism, by the impact of interest rates on the construction and real estate industries and by the impact of world conditions (e.g., U.S. withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan) on federal government spending in Hawaii. For example, the turmoil in the financial markets and declines in the national and global economies had a negative effect on the Hawaii economy in 2009. In 2009, declines in the Hawaii, U.S. and Asian economies in turn led to declines in KWH sales (which continued through 2013), an increase in uncollected billings of the Utilities, higher delinquencies in ASB’s loan portfolio and other adverse effects on HEI’s businesses.If Fitch, Moody's or S&P were to downgrade HEI’s or Hawaiian Electric’s long-term debt ratings because of past adverse effects, or if future events were to adversely affect the availability of capital to the Company, HEI’s and Hawaiian Electric’s ability to borrow and raise capital could be constrained and their future borrowing costs would likely increase with resulting reductions in HEI’s consolidated net income in future periods. Further, if HEI’s or Hawaiian Electric’s commercial paper ratings were to be downgraded, HEI and Hawaiian Electric might not be able to sell commercial paper and might be required to draw on more expensive bank lines of credit or to defer capital or other expenditures.Changes in the U.S. capital markets can also have significant effects on the Company. For example, pension funding requirements are affected by the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for pension plans, and by the discount rate used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost and value obligations. The Utilities’ pension tracking mechanisms help moderate pension expense; however, the significant decline in 2008 in the value of the Company’s defined benefit pension plan assets resulted in a substantial gap between the projected benefit obligations under the plans and the value of plan assets, resulting in increases in funding requirements. The increases have moderated in recent years as investment performance has improved.Because the earnings of ASB depend primarily on net interest income, interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASB’s operations. HEI and the Utilities are also exposed to interest rate risk primarily due to their periodic borrowing requirements, the discount rate used to determine pension funding requirements and the possible effect of interest rates on the electric utilities’ rates of return. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors, including general economic conditions and the policies of government and regulatory authorities. HEI cannot predict future changes in interest rates, nor be certain that interest rate risk management strategies it or its subsidiaries have implemented will be successful in managing interest rate risk.Interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting the fair value of ASB’s investment securities. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair values of those instruments, respectively. Disruptions in the credit markets, a liquidity crisis in the banking industry or increased levels of residential mortgage delinquencies and defaults may result in decreases in the fair value of ASB’s investment securities and an impairment that is other-than-temporary, requiring ASB to write down its investment securities. As of December 31, 2013, 85% of ASB’s investment securities were securities and obligations issued by a federal agency or government sponsored entity that have an implicit guarantee from the U.S. government.HEI and Hawaiian Electric and their subsidiaries may incur higher retirement benefits expenses and have and will likely continue to recognize substantial liabilities for retirement benefits.  Retirement benefits expenses and cash funding 25requirements could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the U.S. equity markets, trends in interest rates and health care costs, plan amendments, new laws relating to pension funding and changes in accounting principles. For the Utilities, however, retirement benefits expenses, as adjusted by the pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions (OPEB) tracking mechanisms, have been an allowable expense for rate-making purposes.The Company is subject to the risks associated with the geographic concentration of its businesses and current lack of interconnections that could result in service interruptions at the Utilities or higher default rates on loans held by ASB.  The business of the Utilities is concentrated on the individual islands they serve in the State of Hawaii. Their operations are more vulnerable to service interruptions than are many U.S. mainland utilities because none of the systems of the Utilities are interconnected with the systems on the other islands they serve. Because of this lack of interconnections, it is necessary to maintain higher generation reserve margins than are typical for U.S. mainland utilities to help ensure reliable service. Service interruptions, including in particular extended interruptions that could result from a natural disaster or terrorist activity, could adversely impact the KWH sales of some or all of the Utilities.Substantially all of ASB’s consumer loan customers are Hawaii residents. A significant portion of the commercial loan customers are located in Hawaii. While a majority of customers are on Oahu, ASB also has customers on the neighbor islands (whose economies have been weaker than Oahu during the recent economic downturn). Substantially all of the real estate underlying ASB’s residential and commercial real estate loans are located in Hawaii. These assets may be subject to a greater risk of default than other comparable assets held by financial institutions with other geographic concentrations in the event of adverse economic, political or business developments or natural disasters affecting Hawaii and the ability of ASB’s customers to make payments of principal and interest on their loans.Increasing competition and technological advances could cause HEI’s businesses to lose customers or render their operations obsolete.  The banking industry in Hawaii, and certain aspects of the electric utility industry, are competitive. The success of HEI’s subsidiaries in meeting competition and responding to technological advances will continue to have a direct impact on HEI’s consolidated financial performance. For example:•ASB, one of the largest financial institutions in the state, is in direct competition for deposits and loans not only with two larger institutions that have substantial capital, technology and marketing resources, but also with smaller Hawaii institutions and other U.S. institutions, including credit unions, mutual funds, mortgage brokers, finance companies and investment banking firms. Larger financial institutions may have greater access to capital at lower costs, which could impair ASB’s ability to compete effectively. Significant advances in technology could render the operations of ASB less competitive or obsolete.•The Utilities face competition from IPPs and customer self-generation, with or without cogeneration. With the exception of certain identified projects, the Utilities are required to use competitive bidding to acquire a future generation resource unless the PUC finds competitive bidding to be unsuitable. The PUC set policies for distributed generation (DG) interconnection agreements and standby rates, and established conditions under which electric utilities can provide DG services on customer-owned sites as a regulated service. The results of competitive bidding, competition from IPPs, customer self-generation and the rate at which technological developments facilitating non-utility generation of electricity occur may adversely affect the Utilities and the results of their operations.•New technological developments, such as the commercial development of energy storage, may render the operations of the Utilities less competitive or outdated.The Company may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security that could adversely affect its businesses and reputation.  The Company is subject to cyber security risks and the potential for cyber incidents, including potential incidents at ASB branches and at the the Utilities' plants and the related electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure, and incidents at data processing centers they use, to the extent not prevented by intrusion detection and prevention systems, anti-virus software, firewalls and other general information technology controls. ASB and the Utilities are highly dependent on their ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions. ASB and the Utilities rely heavily on numerous data processing systems. If any of these systems fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time, the Company could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to its reputation. The Utilities and ASB have disaster recovery plans in place to protect their businesses against natural disasters, security breaches, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures or similar events. The disaster recovery plans, however, may not be successful in preventing the loss of customer data, service interruptions, disruptions to operations or damage to important facilities.HEI’s businesses could suffer losses that are uninsured due to a lack of affordable insurance coverage, unavailability of insurance coverage or limitations on the insurance coverage the Company does have.  In the ordinary course of business, HEI and its subsidiaries purchase insurance coverages (e.g., property and liability coverages) to protect against loss of, or damage to, their properties and against claims made by third parties and employees for property damage or personal injuries. However, the protection provided by such insurance is limited in significant respects and, in some instances, there is no coverage. Certain 26of the insurance has substantial deductibles or has limits on the maximum amounts that may be recovered. For example, the Utilities’ overhead and underground transmission and distribution systems (with the exception of substation buildings and contents) have a replacement value roughly estimated at $6 billion and are not insured against loss or damage because the amount of transmission and distribution system insurance available is limited and the premiums are cost prohibitive. Similarly, the Utilities have no business interruption insurance as the premiums for such insurance would be cost prohibitive, particularly since the Utilities are not interconnected to other systems. If a hurricane or other uninsured catastrophic natural disaster were to occur, and if the PUC were not to allow the affected Utilities to recover from ratepayers restoration costs and revenues lost from business interruption, the lost revenues and repair expenses could result in a significant decrease in HEI’s consolidated net income or in significant net losses for the affected periods.ASB generally does not obtain credit enhancements, such as mortgagor bankruptcy insurance, but does require standard hazard and hurricane insurance and may require flood insurance for certain properties. ASB is subject to the risks of borrower defaults and bankruptcies, special hazard losses not covered by the required insurance and the insurance company’s inability to pay claims on existing policies.Increased federal and state environmental regulation will require an increasing commitment of resources and funds and could result in construction delays or penalties and fines for non-compliance. HEI and its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, hazardous substances, waste management, natural resources and health and safety, which regulate, among other matters, the operation of existing facilities, the construction and operation of new facilities and the proper cleanup and disposal of hazardous and toxic wastes and substances. HEI or its subsidiaries are currently involved in investigatory or remedial actions at current, former or third-party sites and there is no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs relating to these sites. In addition, compliance with these legal requirements requires the Utilities to commit significant resources and funds toward, among other things, environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment and payment of emission fees. These laws and regulations, among other things, require that certain environmental permits be obtained in order to construct or operate certain facilities, and obtaining such permits can entail significant expense and cause substantial construction delays. Also, these laws and regulations may be amended from time to time, including amendments that increase the burden and expense of compliance. For example, emission and/or discharge limits may be tightened, more extensive permitting requirements may be imposed and additional substances may become regulated. In addition, significant regulatory uncertainty exists regarding the impact of federal or state greenhouse gas (GHG) emission limits and reductions.If HEI or its subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond their control, that failure may result in civil or criminal penalties and fines or the cessation of operations.Adverse tax rulings or developments could result in significant increases in tax payments and/or expense.  Governmental taxing authorities could challenge a tax return position taken by HEI or its subsidiaries and, if the taxing authorities prevail, HEI’s consolidated tax payments and/or expense, including applicable penalties and interest, could increase significantly.The Company could be subject to the risk of uninsured losses in excess of its accruals for litigation matters.  HEI and its subsidiaries are involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of their businesses, most of which is covered by insurance (subject to policy limits and deductibles). However, other litigation may arise that is not routine or involves claims that may not be covered by insurance. Because of the uncertainties associated with litigation, there is a risk that litigation against HEI or its subsidiaries, even if vigorously defended, could result in costs of defense and judgment or settlement amounts not covered by insurance and in excess of reserves established in HEI’s consolidated financial statements.Changes in accounting principles and estimates could affect the reported amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities or revenues and expenses.  HEI’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Changes in accounting principles (including the possible adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards or new U.S. accounting standards), or changes in the Company’s application of existing accounting principles, could materially affect the financial statement presentation of HEI’s or the Utilities’ consolidated results of operations and/or financial condition. Further, in preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the amounts reported for investment and mortgage-related securities; property, plant and equipment; pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; contingencies and litigation; income taxes; regulatory assets and liabilities; electric utility revenues; and allowance for loan losses.The Utilities' financial statements reflect assets and costs based on cost-based rate-making regulations. Continued accounting in this manner requires that certain criteria relating to the recoverability of such costs through rates be met. If events or circumstances should change so that the criteria are no longer satisfied, the Utilities’ expect that their regulatory assets 27(amounting to $576 million as of December 31, 2013), net of regulatory liabilities (amounting to $349 million as of December 31, 2013), would be charged to the statement of income in the period of discontinuance. A proposed standard on accounting for expected credit losses was issued by the FASB which would replace existing impairment models, including replacing an “incurred loss” model for loans with a “current expected credit loss” model. There are a number of questions and issues around the expected credit loss model. ASB cannot predict whether or when a final standard will be issued, when it will be effective or what it its final provisions will be. It is possible that the final standard could have a material adverse impact on the bank’s results of operations once it is issued and becomes effective.Changes in accounting principles can also impact HEI’s consolidated financial statements. For example, if management determines that a PPA requires the consolidation of the IPP in the Consolidated Financial Statements, the consolidation could have a material effect on Hawaiian Electric’s and HEI’s consolidated financial statements, including the recognition of a significant amount of assets and liabilities and, if such a consolidated IPP were operating at a loss and had insufficient equity, the potential recognition of such losses. Also, if management determines that a PPA requires the classification of the agreement as a capital lease, a material effect on HEI’s consolidated balance sheet may result, including the recognition of significant capital assets and lease obligations.Electric Utility Risks.Actions of the PUC are outside the control of the Utilities and could result in inadequate or untimely rate increases, in rate reductions or refunds or in unanticipated delays, expenses or writedowns in connection with the construction of new projects.  The rates the Utilities are allowed to charge for their services and the timeliness of permitted rate increases are among the most important items influencing the Utilities’ results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The PUC has broad discretion over the rates that the Utilities charge their customers. As part of the decoupling mechanism that the Utilities have implemented, each of the Utilities will file a rate case once every three years. Any adverse decision by the PUC concerning the level or method of determining electric utility rates, the items and amounts that may be included in rate base, the returns on equity or rate base found to be reasonable, the potential consequences of exceeding or not meeting such returns, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding could have a material adverse effect on Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.To improve the timing and certainty of the recovery of their costs, the Utilities have proposed and received approval of various cost recovery mechanisms including an ECAC and pension and OPEB tracking mechanisms, and more recently a decoupling mechanism, a PPAC, and a renewable energy infrastructure program (REIP) surcharge. A change in, or the elimination of, any of these cost recovery mechanisms, including in the current proceeding in which the PUC is examining the decoupling mechanism, could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities.The Utilities could be required to refund to their customers, with interest, revenues that have been or may be received under interim rate orders in their rate case proceedings, integrated resource plan cost recovery dockets and other proceedings, if and to the extent they exceed the amounts allowed in final orders.Many public utility projects require PUC approval and various permits (e.g., environmental and land use permits) from other governmental agencies. Difficulties in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, the necessary approvals or permits, or any adverse decision or policy made or adopted, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision, by an agency with respect to such approvals and permits, can result in significantly increased project costs or even cancellation of projects. In the event a project does not proceed, or if the PUC disallows cost recovery for all or part of a project, project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could result in significant reductions in Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated net income. For example, Hawaiian Electric’s East Oahu Transmission Project encountered substantial opposition and consequent delay, increased costs and a subsequent partial write-off of costs in the fourth quarter of 2011. Also, in January 2013, the Utilities and the Consumer Advocate signed a settlement agreement to write off $40 million of costs in lieu of conducting PUC-ordered regulatory audits of the CIP CT-1 and the CIS projects. Energy cost adjustment clauses. The rate schedules of each of the Utilities include ECACs under which electric rates charged to customers are automatically adjusted for changes in the weighted-average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power, and the relative amounts of company-generated power and purchased power.The Energy Agreement confirms the intent of the parties that the existing ECACs will continue, but subject to periodic review by the PUC. The Energy Agreement also provides that as part of the review, the PUC may examine whether there are renewable energy projects from which the Utilities should have, but did not, purchase energy or whether alternative fuel purchase strategies were appropriately used or not used.In the recent rate cases, the PUC has allowed the current ECAC to continue. However, a change in, or the elimination of, the ECAC could have a material adverse effect on the Utilities.28Electric utility operations are significantly influenced by weather conditions.  The Utilities’ results of operations can be affected by the weather. Weather conditions, particularly temperature and humidity, directly influence the demand for electricity. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis and lightning storms, which may become more severe or frequent as a result of global climate changes, can cause outages and property damage and require the Utilities to incur significant additional expenses that may not be recoverable.Electric utility operations depend heavily on third-party suppliers of fuel and purchased power.  The Utilities rely on fuel oil suppliers and shippers and IPPs to deliver fuel oil and power, respectively, in accordance with contractual agreements. Approximately 72% of the net energy generated or purchased by the Utilities in 2013 was generated from the burning of fossil fuel oil, and purchases of power by the Utilities provided about 44% of their total net energy generated and purchased for the same period. Failure or delay by oil suppliers and shippers to provide fuel pursuant to existing contracts, or failure by a major IPP to deliver the firm capacity anticipated in its PPA, could disrupt the ability of the Utilities to deliver electricity and require the Utilities to incur additional expenses to meet the needs of their customers that may not be recoverable. In addition, as these contractual agreements end, the Utilities may not be able to purchase fuel and power on terms equivalent to the current contractual agreements. Further, as the use of biofuels in generating units increases, the same risks will exist with suppliers of biofuels.Electric utility generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated and/or increased operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs.  Operation of electric generating facilities involves certain risks which can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels. Included among these risks are facility shutdowns or power interruptions due to insufficient generation or a breakdown or failure of equipment or processes or interruptions in fuel supply, inability to negotiate satisfactory collective bargaining agreements when existing agreements expire or other labor disputes, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements, disruptions in delivery of electricity, operator error and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, fires, explosions, floods or other similar occurrences affecting the Utilities’ generating facilities or transmission and distribution systems.  The Utilities may be adversely affected by new legislation.  Congress, the Hawaii legislature and governmental agencies periodically consider legislation and other initiatives that could have uncertain or negative effects on the Utilities and their customers. Congress, the Hawaii legislature and governmental agencies have adopted, or are considering adopting, a number of measures that will significantly affect the Utilities, as described below.Renewable Portfolio Standards law.  In 2009, Hawaii’s RPS law was amended to require electric utilities to meet an RPS of 10%, 15%, 25% and 40% by December 31, 2010, 2015, 2020 and 2030, respectively. Energy savings resulting from energy efficiency programs will not count toward the RPS after 2014. The Utilities are committed to achieving these goals and met the 2010 RPS; however, due to the exclusion of energy savings in calculating RPS after 2014 and risks such as potential delays in IPPs being able to deliver contracted renewable energy, it is possible the Utilities may not attain the required renewable percentages in the future, and management cannot predict the future consequences of failure to do so (including potential penalties to be assessed by the PUC). On December 19, 2008, the PUC approved a penalty of $20 for every MWh that an electric utility is deficient under Hawaii’s RPS law. The PUC noted, however, that this penalty may be reduced, in the PUC’s discretion, due to events or circumstances that are outside an electric utility’s reasonable control, to the extent the event or circumstance could not be reasonably foreseen and ameliorated, as described in the RPS law and in an RPS framework adopted by the PUC. In addition, the PUC ordered that the Utilities will be prohibited from recovering any RPS penalty costs through rates.Renewable energy.  In 2007, a measure was passed by the Hawaii legislature stating that the PUC may consider the need for increased renewable energy in rendering decisions on utility matters. Due to this measure, it is possible that, if energy from a renewable source is more expensive than energy from fossil fuel, the PUC may still approve the purchase of energy from the renewable source, resulting in higher costs.Global climate change and greenhouse gas emissions reduction.  National and international concern about climate change and the contribution of GHG emissions to climate change have led to action by the state of Hawaii and federal legislative and regulatory proposals to reduce GHG emissions.In July 2007, Act 234, which requires a statewide reduction of GHG emissions by January 1, 2020 to levels at or below the statewide GHG emission levels in 1990, became law in Hawaii.In recent years, several approaches to GHG emission reduction (including “cap and trade”) have been either introduced or discussed in Congress; however, no legislation has yet been enacted.In response to the 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, which ruled that the EPA has the authority to regulate GHG emissions from motor vehicles under the CAA, the EPA has accelerated rulemaking addressing GHG emissions from both mobile and stationary sources. On September 22, 2009, the EPA issued the 29Final Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule. The rule, which applies to the Utilities, requires that sources above certain threshold levels monitor and report GHG emissions.On June 3, 2010, the EPA’s final “Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Tailoring Rule” (GHG Tailoring Rule) was published. It creates a new emissions threshold for GHG emissions from new and existing facilities and requires certain facilities to obtain PSD and Title V operating permits. The Utilities’ existing facilities have thus far not been subject to GHG emissions limits or controls, but the Utilities are required to conduct GHG analyses for modifications or new construction projects that are expected to result in GHG emissions above the specified threshold.The foregoing legislation or legislation that now is, or may in the future be, proposed present risks and uncertainties for the Utilities.The Utilities may be subject to increased operational challenges and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely impacted in meeting the commitments and objectives of the HCEI Energy Agreement.  On October 20, 2008, the Governor of the State of Hawaii, the DBEDT, the Division of Consumer Advocacy of the State of Hawaii Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs and the Utilities (collectively, the parties), signed an Energy Agreement setting forth the goals and objectives of the HCEI and the related commitments of the parties. The Energy Agreement requires the parties to pursue a wide range of actions to decrease the State’s dependence on imported fossil fuels through substantial increases in the use of renewable energy and programs intended to secure greater energy efficiency and conservation.The far-reaching nature of the Energy Agreement, including the extent of renewable energy commitments, presents risks to the Company. Among such risks are: (1) the dependence on third party suppliers of renewable purchased energy, which if the Utilities are unsuccessful in negotiating purchased power agreements with such IPPs or if a major IPP fails to deliver the anticipated capacity in its purchased power agreement, could impact the Utilities’ achievement of their commitments under the Energy Agreement and/or the Utilities’ ability to deliver reliable service; (2) delays in acquiring or unavailability of non-fossil fuel supplies for renewable generation; (3) the impact of intermittent power to the electrical grid and reliability of service if appropriate supporting infrastructure is not installed or does not operate effectively; (4) the likelihood that the Utilities may need to make substantial investments in related infrastructure, which could result in increased borrowings and, therefore, materially impact the financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities; and (5) the commitment to support a variety of initiatives, which, if approved by the PUC, may have a material impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the Utilities depending on their design and implementation. These initiatives include, but are not limited to, removing the system-wide caps on net energy metering (but studying distributed generation interconnections on a per-circuit basis); and developing an Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard. The implementation of these or other HCEI programs may adversely impact the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the Utilities.Bank Risks.Fluctuations in interest rates could result in lower net interest income, impair ASB’s ability to originate new loans or impair the ability of ASB’s adjustable-rate borrowers to make increased payments.  Interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASB’s operations. ASB’s net interest income consists primarily of interest income received on fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, mortgage-related securities and investments and interest expense consisting primarily of interest paid on deposits and other borrowings. Interest rate risk arises when earning assets mature or when their interest rates change in a time frame different from that of the costing liabilities. Changes in market interest rates, including changes in the relationship between short-term and long-term market interest rates or between different interest rate indices, can impact ASB’s net interest margin.Although ASB pursues an asset-liability management strategy designed to mitigate its risk from changes in market interest rates, unfavorable movements in interest rates could result in lower net interest income. Residential 1-4 family fixed-rate mortgage loans comprised about 45% of ASB’s loan portfolio as of December 31, 2013 and do not re-price with movements in interest rates. ASB continues to face a challenging interest rate environment. Although interest rates rose in 2013, new loan production rates are still historically low and below ASB's loan porfolio yields. This places additional pressure on ASB's asset yields and net interest margin. The degree to which compression of ASB's margin continues is uncertain as interest rates rise.Increases in market interest rates could have an adverse impact on ASB’s cost of funds. Higher market interest rates could lead to higher interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Significant increases in market interest rates, or the perception that an increase may occur, could adversely affect ASB’s ability to originate new loans and grow. An increase in market interest rates, especially a sudden increase, could also adversely affect the ability of ASB’s adjustable-rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations. If this occurred, it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets and charge-offs. Conversely, a decrease in interest rates or a mismatching of maturities of interest sensitive financial instruments could result in an acceleration in the prepayment of loans and mortgage-related securities and impact ASB’s ability to reinvest its liquidity in similar yielding assets. 30ASB’s operations are affected by many disparate factors, some of which are beyond its control, that could result in lower net interest income or decreased demand for its products and services.  ASB’s results of operations depend primarily on the level of interest income generated by ASB’s earning assets in excess of the interest expense on its costing liabilities and the supply of and demand for its products and services (i.e., loans and deposits). ASB’s net income may also be adversely affected by various other factors, such as:•local and other economic and political conditions that could result in declines in employment and real estate values, which in turn could adversely affect the ability of borrowers to make loan payments and the ability of ASB to recover the full amounts owing to it under defaulted loans;•the ability of borrowers to obtain insurance and the ability of ASB to place insurance where borrowers fail to do so, particularly in the event of catastrophic damage to collateral securing loans made by ASB;•faster than expected loan prepayments that can cause an acceleration of the amortization of premiums on loans and investments and the impairment of mortgage servicing assets of ASB;•changes in ASB’s loan portfolio credit profiles and asset quality, which may increase or decrease the required level of allowance for loan losses;•technological disruptions affecting ASB’s operations or financial or operational difficulties experienced by any outside vendor on whom ASB relies to provide key components of its business operations, such as business processing, network access or internet connections;•the impact of legislative and regulatory changes affecting capital requirements and increasing oversight of, and reporting by, banks;•additional legislative changes regulating the assessment of overdraft, interchange and credit card fees, which will have a negative impact on noninterest income;•public opinion about ASB and financial institutions in general, which, if negative, could impact the public’s trust and confidence in ASB and adversely affect ASB’s ability to attract and retain customers and expose ASB to adverse legal and regulatory consequences;•increases in operating costs (including employee compensation expense and benefits), inflation and other factors, that exceed increases in ASB’ s net interest, fee and other income; and•the ability of ASB to maintain or increase the level of deposits, ASB’s lowest costing funds.Banking and related regulations could result in significant restrictions being imposed on ASB’s business or in a requirement that HEI divest ASB.  ASB is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the Department of Treasury, the OCC and the FDIC, and is subject to reserve requirements established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In addition, the FRB is responsible for regulating ASB’s holding companies, HEI and ASHI. The regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies to address not only ASB’s compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations, but also capital adequacy, asset quality, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity and various other factors.Under certain circumstances, including any determination that ASB’s relationship with HEI results in an unsafe and unsound banking practice, these regulatory authorities have the authority to restrict the ability of ASB to transfer assets and to make distributions to its shareholders (including payment of dividends to HEI), or they could seek to require HEI to sever its relationship with or divest its ownership of ASB. Payment by ASB of dividends to HEI may also be restricted by the OCC and FRB under its prompt corrective action regulations or its capital distribution regulations if ASB’s capital position deteriorates. In order to maintain its status as a QTL, ASB is required to maintain at least 65% of its assets in “qualified thrift investments.” Institutions that fail to maintain QTL status are subject to various penalties, including limitations on their activities. In ASB’s case, the activities of HEI and HEI’s other subsidiaries would also be subject to restrictions, and a failure or inability to comply with those restrictions could effectively result in the required divestiture of ASB. Federal legislation has also been proposed in the past that could result in a required divestiture of ASB. In the event of a required divestiture, federal law substantially limits the types of entities that could potentially acquire ASB.Recent legislative and regulatory initiatives could have an adverse effect on ASB’s business.  The Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July 2010, has had a substantial impact on the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes a framework through which regulatory reform will be written and changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies could affect HEI and ASB in substantial and unpredictable ways. A major component of the Dodd-Frank Act is the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that has the responsibility for setting and enforcing clear, consistent rules relating to consumer financial products and services and has the authority to prohibit practices it finds to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. Compliance with any such directives could have adverse effects on ASB’s revenues or operating costs. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on ASB’s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.A large percentage of ASB’s loans and securities are collateralized by real estate, and adverse changes in the real estate market and/or general economic or other conditions may result in loan losses and adversely affect the Company’s profitability.  31As of December 31, 2013 approximately 79% of ASB’s loan portfolio was comprised of loans primarily collateralized by real estate, most of which was concentrated in the State of Hawaii. ASB’s HELOC (home equity line of credit) portfolio grew by 17% during 2013 and now comprises 23% of total real estate loans. ASB’s financial results may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions, either nationally or in the state of Hawaii, including decreases in real estate values, adverse employment conditions, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal and state government and other significant external events. A deterioration of the economic environment in Hawaii, including a material decline in the real estate market, further declines in home resales, or a material external shock, or any environmental clean-up obligation, may significantly impair the value of ASB’s collateral and ASB’s ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. In the event of a default, amounts received upon sale of the collateral may be insufficient to recover outstanding principal and interest. Adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans. In addition, if poor economic conditions result in decreased demand for real estate loans, ASB’s profits may decrease if alternative investments earn less income than real estate loans.ASB’s strategy to expand its commercial and commercial real estate lending activities may result in higher service costs and greater credit risk than residential lending activities due to the unique characteristics of these markets.  ASB has been aggressively pursuing a strategy that includes expanding its commercial and commercial real estate lines of business. These types of loans generally entail higher underwriting and other service costs and present greater credit risks than traditional residential mortgages.Generally, both commercial and commercial real estate loans have shorter terms to maturity and earn higher spreads than residential mortgage loans. Only the assets of the business typically secure commercial loans. In such cases, upon default, any collateral repossessed may not be sufficient to repay the outstanding loan balance. In addition, loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and, thus, are more likely to be affected by current economic conditions and adverse business developments.ASB has grown its national syndicated lending portfolio where ASB is a participant in credit facilities agented by established and reputable national lenders. Management selectively chooses each deal based on conservative credit criteria to ensure a high quality, well diversified portfolio.Commercial real estate properties tend to be unique and are more difficult to value than residential real estate properties. Commercial real estate loans may not be fully amortizing, meaning that they may have a significant principal balance or “balloon” payment due at maturity. In addition, commercial real estate properties, particularly industrial and warehouse properties, are generally subject to relatively greater environmental risks than noncommercial properties and to the corresponding burdens and costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Also, there may be costs and delays involved in enforcing rights of a property owner against tenants in default under the terms of leases with respect to commercial properties. For example, a tenant may seek the protection of bankruptcy laws, which could result in termination of the tenant’s lease"
13,HE,HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC INDS,2013-02-19,"ITEM 1A.          RISK FACTORS The businesses of HEI and its subsidiaries involve numerous risks which, if realized, could have a material and adverse effect on the Companys financial statements. For additional information for certain risk factors enumerated below and other risks of the Company and its operations, see Forward-Looking Statements above and HEIs MD&A, HEIs Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, HEIs Consolidated Financial Statements, HECOs MD&A, HECOs Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and HECOs Consolidated Financial Statements. Holding Company and Company-Wide Risks. HEI is a holding company that derives its income from its operating subsidiaries and depends on the ability of those subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI and on its own ability to raise capital.  HEI is a legal entity separate and distinct from its various subsidiaries. As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, HEIs cash flows and consequent ability to service its obligations and pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon its receipt of dividends or other distributions from its operating subsidiaries and its ability to issue common stock or other equity securities and to incur additional debt. The ability of HEIs subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI, in turn, is subject to the risks associated with their operations and to contractual and regulatory restrictions, including: · the   provisions of an HEI agreement with the PUC, which could limit the ability of   HEIs principal electric public utility subsidiary, HECO, to pay dividends to   HEI in the event that the consolidated common stock equity of the electric   public utility subsidiaries falls below 35% of total capitalization of the   electric utilities;       · the   provisions of an HEI agreement entered into with federal bank regulators in   connection with its acquisition of its bank subsidiary, ASB, which require   HEI to contribute additional capital to ASB (up to a maximum amount of   additional capital of $28.3 million as of December 31, 2012) upon   request of the regulators in order to maintain ASBs regulatory capital at   the level required by regulation;       · the   minimum capital and capital distribution regulations of the OCC that are   applicable to ASB;       · the   receipt of a letter from the OCC and FRB stating it has no objection to the   payment of any dividend ASB proposes to declare and pay to HEI; and       · the   provisions of preferred stock resolutions and debt instruments of HEI and its   subsidiaries.    The Company is subject to risks associated with the Hawaii economy (in the aggregate and on an individual island basis), volatile U.S. capital markets and changes in the interest rate and credit market environment that have and/or could result in higher retirement benefit plan funding requirements, declines in electric utility KWH sales, declines in ASBs interest rate margins and investment values, higher delinquencies and charge-offs in ASBs loan portfolio and restrictions on the ability of HEI or its subsidiaries to borrow money or issue securities.  The two largest components of Hawaiis economy are tourism and the federal government (including the military). Because the core businesses of HEIs subsidiaries are providing local public electric utility services (through HECO and its subsidiaries) and banking services (through ASB) in Hawaii, the Companys operating results are significantly influenced by Hawaiis economy, which in turn is influenced by economic conditions in the mainland U.S. (particularly California) and Asia (particularly Japan) as a result of the impact of those conditions on tourism, by the impact of interest rates on the construction and real estate industries and by the impact of world conditions (e.g., U.S. presence in Afghanistan) on federal government spending in Hawaii. For example, the turmoil in the financial markets and declines in the national and global economies had a negative effect on the Hawaii economy in 2009. In 2009, declines in the Hawaii, U.S. and Asian economies in turn led to declines in KWH sales (which continued into 2010, 2011 and 2012), an increase in uncollected billings of HECO and its subsidiaries, higher delinquencies in ASBs loan portfolio and other adverse effects on HEIs businesses. 26 If S&P or Moodys were to downgrade HEIs or HECOs long-term debt ratings because of past adverse effects, or if future events were to adversely affect the availability of capital to the Company, HEIs and HECOs ability to borrow and raise capital could be constrained and their future borrowing costs would likely increase with resulting reductions in HEIs consolidated net income in future periods. Further, if HEIs or HECOs commercial paper ratings were to be downgraded, HEI and HECO might not be able to sell commercial paper and might be required to draw on more expensive bank lines of credit or to defer capital or other expenditures. Changes in the U.S. capital markets can also have significant effects on the Company. For example, pension funding requirements are affected by the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for pension plans, and by the discount rate used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost and value obligations. The electric utilities pension tracking mechanisms help moderate pension expense; however, the significant decline in 2008 in the value of the Companys defined benefit pension plan assets resulted in a substantial gap between the projected benefit obligations under the plans and the value of plan assets, resulting in increases in funding requirements. Because the earnings of ASB depend primarily on net interest income, interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASBs operations. HEI and its electric utility subsidiaries are also exposed to interest rate risk primarily due to their periodic borrowing requirements, the discount rate used to determine pension funding requirements and the possible effect of interest rates on the electric utilities rates of return. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors, including general economic conditions and the policies of government and regulatory authorities. HEI cannot predict future changes in interest rates, nor be certain that interest rate risk management strategies it or its subsidiaries have implemented will be successful in managing interest rate risk. Interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting the fair value of ASBs investment securities. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair values of those instruments, respectively. Disruptions in the credit markets, a liquidity crisis in the banking industry or increased levels of residential mortgage delinquencies and defaults may result in decreases in the fair value of ASBs investment securities and an impairment that is other-than-temporary, requiring ASB to write down its investment securities. As of December 31, 2012, 88% of ASBs investment securities were securities and obligations issued by a federal agency or government sponsored entity that have an implicit guarantee from the U.S. government. HEI and HECO and their subsidiaries may incur higher retirement benefits expenses and have and will likely continue to recognize substantial liabilities for retirement benefits.  Retirement benefits expenses and cash funding requirements could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the U.S. equity markets, trends in interest rates and health care costs, plan amendments, new laws relating to pension funding and changes in accounting principles. For the electric utilities, however, retirement benefits expenses, as adjusted by the pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions (OPEB) tracking mechanisms, have been an allowable expense for rate-making purposes. The Company is subject to the risks associated with the geographic concentration of its businesses and current lack of interconnections that could result in service interruptions at the electric utilities or higher default rates on loans held by ASB.  The business of HECO and its electric utility subsidiaries is concentrated on the individual islands they serve in the State of Hawaii. Their operations are more vulnerable to service interruptions than are many U.S. mainland utilities because none of the systems of HECO and its subsidiaries are interconnected with the systems on the other islands they serve. Because of this lack of interconnections, it is necessary to maintain higher generation reserve margins than are typical for U.S. mainland utilities to help ensure reliable service. Service interruptions, including in particular extended interruptions that could result from a natural disaster or terrorist activity, could adversely impact the KWH sales of some or all of the electric utility subsidiaries. Substantially all of ASBs consumer loan customers are Hawaii residents. A significant portion of the commercial loan customers are located in Hawaii. While a majority of customers are on Oahu, ASB also has customers on the neighbor islands (whose economies have been weaker than Oahu during the recent economic downturn). Substantially all of the real estate underlying ASBs residential and commercial real estate loans are located in Hawaii. These assets may be subject to a greater risk of default than other comparable assets held by financial institutions with other geographic concentrations in the event of adverse economic, political or business 27 developments or natural disasters affecting Hawaii and the ability of ASBs customers to make payments of principal and interest on their loans. Increasing competition and technological advances could cause HEIs businesses to lose customers or render their operations obsolete.  The banking industry in Hawaii, and certain aspects of the electric utility industry, are competitive. The success of HEIs subsidiaries in meeting competition and responding to technological advances will continue to have a direct impact on HEIs consolidated financial performance. For example: ·                 ASB, one of the largest financial institutions in the state, is in direct competition for deposits and loans not only with two larger institutions that have substantial capital, technology and marketing resources, but also with smaller Hawaii institutions and other U.S. institutions, including credit unions, mutual funds, mortgage brokers, finance companies and investment banking firms. Larger financial institutions may have greater access to capital at lower costs, which could impair ASBs ability to compete effectively. Significant advances in technology could render the operations of ASB less competitive or obsolete. ·                 HECO and its subsidiaries face competition from IPPs and customer self-generation, with or without cogeneration. With the exception of certain identified projects, the utilities are required to use competitive bidding to acquire a future generation resource unless the PUC finds competitive bidding to be unsuitable. The PUC set policies for DG interconnection agreements and standby rates, and established conditions under which electric utilities can provide DG services on customer-owned sites as a regulated service. The results of competitive bidding, competition from IPPs, customer self-generation and the rate at which technological developments facilitating non-utility generation of electricity occur may adversely affect the utilities and the results of their operations. ·                 New technological developments, such as the commercial development of energy storage, may render the operations of HEIs electric utility subsidiaries less competitive or outdated. The Company may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security that could adversely affect its businesses and reputation.  The Company is subject to cyber security risks and the potential for cyber incidents, including potential incidents at ASB branches and at the HECO, HELCO and MECO plants and the related electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure, and incidents at data processing centers they use, to the extent not prevented by intrusion detection and prevention systems, anti-virus software, firewalls and other general information technology controls. ASB and HECO are highly dependent on their ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions. ASB and the utilities rely heavily on numerous data processing systems. If any of these systems fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time, the Company could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to its reputation. The utilities and ASB have disaster recovery plans in place to protect their businesses against natural disasters, security breaches, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures or similar events. The disaster recovery plans, however, may not be successful in preventing the loss of customer data, service interruptions, disruptions to operations or damage to important facilities. HEIs businesses could suffer losses that are uninsured due to a lack of affordable insurance coverage, unavailability of insurance coverage or limitations on the insurance coverage the Company does have.  In the ordinary course of business, HEI and its subsidiaries purchase insurance coverages (e.g., property and liability coverages) to protect against loss of, or damage to, their properties and against claims made by third parties and employees for property damage or personal injuries. However, the protection provided by such insurance is limited in significant respects and, in some instances, there is no coverage. Certain of the insurance has substantial deductibles or has limits on the maximum amounts that may be recovered. For example, the electric utilities overhead and underground transmission and distribution systems (with the exception of substation buildings and contents) have a replacement value roughly estimated at $6 billion and are not insured against loss or damage because the amount of transmission and distribution system insurance available is limited and the premiums are cost prohibitive. Similarly, the electric utilities have no business interruption insurance as the premiums for such insurance would be cost prohibitive, particularly since the utilities are not interconnected to 28 other systems. If a hurricane or other uninsured catastrophic natural disaster were to occur, and if the PUC were not to allow the affected electric utilities to recover from ratepayers restoration costs and revenues lost from business interruption, the lost revenues and repair expenses could result in a significant decrease in HEIs consolidated net income or in significant net losses for the affected periods. ASB generally does not obtain credit enhancements, such as mortgagor bankruptcy insurance, but does require standard hazard and hurricane insurance and may require flood insurance for certain properties. ASB is subject to the risks of borrower defaults and bankruptcies, special hazard losses not covered by the required insurance and the insurance companys inability to pay claims on existing policies. Increased federal and state environmental regulation will require an increasing commitment of resources and funds and could result in construction delays or penalties and fines for non-compliance. HEI and its subsidiaries are subject to federal and state environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety, which regulate the operation of existing facilities, the construction and operation of new facilities and the proper cleanup and disposal of hazardous waste and toxic substances. Compliance with these legal requirements requires HEIs utility subsidiaries to commit significant resources and funds toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment and payment of emission fees. These laws and regulations, among other things, require that certain environmental permits be obtained in order to construct or operate certain facilities, and obtaining such permits can entail significant expense and cause substantial construction delays. Also, these laws and regulations may be amended from time to time, including amendments that increase the burden and expense of compliance. For example, emission and/or discharge limits may be tightened, more extensive permitting requirements may be imposed and additional substances may become regulated. In addition, significant regulatory uncertainty exists regarding the impact of federal or state GHG emission limits and reductions. If HEI or its subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond their control, that failure may result in civil or criminal penalties and fines. Adverse tax rulings or developments could result in significant increases in tax payments and/or expense.  Governmental taxing authorities could challenge a tax return position taken by HEI or its subsidiaries and, if the taxing authorities prevail, HEIs consolidated tax payments and/or expense, including applicable penalties and interest, could increase significantly. The Company could be subject to the risk of uninsured losses in excess of its accruals for litigation matters.  HEI and its subsidiaries are involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of their businesses, most of which is covered by insurance (subject to policy limits and deductibles). However, other litigation may arise that is not routine or involves claims that may not be covered by insurance. Because of the uncertainties associated with litigation, there is a risk that litigation against HEI or its subsidiaries, even if vigorously defended, could result in costs of defense and judgment or settlement amounts not covered by insurance and in excess of reserves established in HEIs consolidated financial statements. Changes in accounting principles and estimates could affect the reported amounts of the Companys assets and liabilities or revenues and expenses.  HEIs consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Changes in accounting principles (including the possible adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards or new U.S. accounting standards), or changes in the Companys application of existing accounting principles, could materially affect the financial statement presentation of HEIs or the electric utilities consolidated results of operations and/or financial condition. Further, in preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the amounts reported for investment and mortgage-related securities; property, plant and equipment; pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; contingencies and litigation; income taxes; regulatory assets and liabilities; electric utility revenues; and allowance for loan losses. HECO and its subsidiaries financial statements reflect assets and costs based on cost-based rate-making regulations. Continued accounting in this manner requires that certain criteria relating to the recoverability of 29 such costs through rates be met. If events or circumstances should change so that the criteria are no longer satisfied, the electric utilities regulatory assets (amounting to $865 million as of December 31, 2012) may need to be charged to expense, which could result in significant reductions in the electric utilities net income, and the electric utilities regulatory liabilities (amounting to $322 million as of December 31, 2012) may need to be refunded to ratepayers immediately. Changes in accounting principles can also impact HEIs consolidated financial statements. For example, if management determines that a PPA requires the consolidation of the IPP in HECOs consolidated financial statements, the consolidation could have a material effect on HECOs and HEIs consolidated financial statements, including the recognition of a significant amount of assets and liabilities and, if such a consolidated IPP were operating at a loss and had insufficient equity, the potential recognition of such losses. Also, if management determines that a PPA requires the classification of the agreement as a capital lease, a material effect on HEIs consolidated balance sheet may result, including the recognition of significant capital assets and lease obligations. Electric Utility Risks. Actions of the PUC are outside the control of the electric utility subsidiaries and could result in inadequate or untimely rate increases, in rate reductions or refunds or in unanticipated delays, expenses or writedowns in connection with the construction of new projects.  The rates the electric utilities are allowed to charge for their services and the timeliness of permitted rate increases are among the most important items influencing the electric utilities results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The PUC has broad discretion over the rates that the electric utilities charge their customers. The electric utilities currently have rate cases pending before the PUC. In addition, as part of the decoupling mechanism that the electric utilities have implemented, each of the electric utilities will file a rate case once every three years. Any adverse decision by the PUC concerning the level or method of determining electric utility rates, the items and amounts that may be included in rate base, the returns on equity or rate base found to be reasonable, the potential consequences of exceeding or not meeting such returns, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding could have a material adverse effect on HECOs consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. To improve the timing and certainty of the recovery of their costs, the electric utilities have proposed and received approval of various cost recovery mechanisms including an ECAC and pension and OPEB tracking mechanisms, and more recently a decoupling mechanism, a PPAC, and a renewable energy infrastructure program surcharge. A change in, or the elimination of, any of these cost recovery mechanisms could have a material adverse effect on the electric utilities. The electric utilities could be required to refund to their customers, with interest, revenues that have been or may be received under interim rate orders in their rate case proceedings, integrated resource plan cost recovery dockets and other proceedings, if and to the extent they exceed the amounts allowed in final orders. Many public utility projects require PUC approval and various permits (e.g., environmental and land use permits) from other governmental agencies. Difficulties in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, the necessary approvals or permits, or any adverse decision or policy made or adopted, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision, by an agency with respect to such approvals and permits, can result in significantly increased project costs or even cancellation of projects. For example, HECOs East Oahu Transmission Project encountered substantial opposition and consequent delay, increased costs and a subsequent partial write-off of costs in the fourth quarter of 2011. Also, in January 2013, the utilities and the Consumer Advocate signed a settlement agreement, subject to approval by the PUC, to write off $40 million of costs in lieu of conducting PUC-ordered regulatory audits of the CIP CT-1 and the CIS projects. In the event a project does not proceed, or if the PUC disallows cost recovery for all or part of a project, project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could result in significant reductions in HECOs consolidated net income. Energy cost adjustment clauses. The rate schedules of each of HEIs electric utilities include ECACs under which electric rates charged to customers are automatically adjusted for changes in the weighted-average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power, and the relative amounts of company-generated power and purchased power. 30 The Energy Agreement confirms the intent of the parties that the existing ECACs will continue, but subject to periodic review by the PUC. The Energy Agreement also provides that as part of the review, the PUC may examine whether there are renewable energy projects from which the utilities should have, but did not, purchase energy or whether alternative fuel purchase strategies were appropriately used or not used. In the recent rate cases, the PUC has allowed the current ECAC to continue. However, a change in, or the elimination of, the ECAC could have a material adverse effect on the electric utilities. Electric utility operations are significantly influenced by weather conditions.  The electric utilities results of operations can be affected by the weather. Weather conditions, particularly temperature and humidity, directly influence the demand for electricity. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis and lightning storms, which may become more severe or frequent as a result of global warming, can cause outages and property damage and require the utilities to incur significant additional expenses that may not be recoverable. Electric utility operations depend heavily on third-party suppliers of fuel and purchased power.  The electric utilities rely on fuel oil suppliers and shippers and IPPs to deliver fuel oil and power, respectively, in accordance with contractual agreements. Approximately 73% of the net energy generated or purchased by the electric utilities in 2012 was generated from the burning of fossil fuel oil, and purchases of power by the electric utilities provided about 42% of their total net energy generated and purchased for the same period. Failure or delay by oil suppliers and shippers to provide fuel pursuant to existing contracts, or failure by a major IPP to deliver the firm capacity anticipated in its PPA, could disrupt the ability of the electric utilities to deliver electricity and require the electric utilities to incur additional expenses to meet the needs of their customers that may not be recoverable. In addition, as these contractual agreements end, the electric utilities may not be able to purchase fuel and power on terms equivalent to the current contractual agreements. Further, as the use of biofuels in generating units increases, the same risks will exist with suppliers of biofuels. Electric utility generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated and/or increased operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs.  Operation of electric generating facilities involves certain risks which can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels. Included among these risks are facility shutdowns or power interruptions due to insufficient generation or a breakdown or failure of equipment or processes or interruptions in fuel supply, inability to negotiate satisfactory collective bargaining agreements when existing agreements expire or other labor disputes, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements, disruptions in delivery of electricity, operator error and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, fires, explosions, floods or other similar occurrences affecting the electric utilities generating facilities or transmission and distribution systems. The utilities have taken a number of steps to mitigate the risk of outages, including securing additional purchased power, adding new utility generation, adding distributed generation and encouraging energy conservation. The costs of supplying energy to meet high demand and maintenance costs required to sustain high availability of aging generation units have been increasing and the trend of cost increases is not likely to ease, putting pressure on earnings to the extent timely cost recovery is not achieved. The electric utilities may be adversely affected by new legislation.  Congress and the Hawaii Legislature periodically consider legislation that could have uncertain or negative effects on the electric utilities and their customers. The Hawaii Legislature has adopted a number of measures that will significantly affect the electric utilities, as described below. Renewable Portfolio Standards law.  In 2009, Hawaiis RPS law was amended to require electric utilities to meet an RPS of 10%, 15%, 25% and 40% by December 31, 2010, 2015, 2020 and 2030, respectively. Energy savings resulting from energy efficiency programs will not count toward the RPS after 2014. The utilities are committed to achieving these goals and met the 2010 RPS; however, due to the exclusion of energy savings in calculating RPS after 2014 and risks such as potential delays in IPPs being able to deliver contracted renewable energy, it is possible the electric utilities may not attain the required renewable percentages in the future, and management cannot predict the future consequences of failure to do so (including potential penalties to be assessed by the PUC). On December 19, 2008, the PUC approved a penalty 31 of $20 for every MWh that an electric utility is deficient under Hawaiis RPS law. The PUC noted, however, that this penalty may be reduced, in the PUCs discretion, due to events or circumstances that are outside an electric utilitys reasonable control, to the extent the event or circumstance could not be reasonably foreseen and ameliorated, as described in the RPS law and in an RPS framework. In addition, the PUC ordered that the utilities will be prohibited from recovering any RPS penalty costs through rates. Renewable energy.  In 2007, a measure was passed by the Hawaii legislature stating that the PUC may consider the need for increased renewable energy in rendering decisions on utility matters. Due to this measure, it is possible that, if energy from a renewable source were more expensive than energy from fossil fuel, the PUC may still approve the purchase of energy from the renewable source, resulting in higher costs. Global climate change and greenhouse gas emissions reduction.  National and international concern about climate change and the contribution of GHG emissions to global warming have led to action by the state of Hawaii and federal legislative and regulatory proposals to reduce GHG emissions. In July 2007, Act 234, which requires a statewide reduction of GHG emissions by January 1, 2020 to levels at or below the statewide GHG emission levels in 1990, became law in Hawaii. In recent years, several approaches to GHG emission reduction (including cap and trade) have been either introduced or discussed in Congress; however, no legislation has yet been enacted. In response to the 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, which ruled that the EPA has the authority to regulate GHG emissions from motor vehicles under the CAA, the EPA has accelerated rulemaking addressing GHG emissions from both mobile and stationary sources. On September 22, 2009, the EPA issued the Final Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule. The rule, which applies to HECO, HELCO and MECO, requires that sources above certain threshold levels monitor GHG emissions. On June 3, 2010, the EPAs final Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Tailoring Rule (GHG Tailoring Rule) was published. It creates a new emissions threshold for GHG emissions from new and existing facilities. The utilities are evaluating the impact of the GHG Tailoring Rule and a three-year permit deferral for biomass-fired and other biogenic sources on the utilities operations. The foregoing legislation or legislation that now is, or may in the future be, proposed present risks and uncertainties for the utilities. The electric utilities may be subject to increased operational challenges and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely impacted in meeting the commitments and objectives of the HCEI Energy Agreement.  On October 20, 2008, the Governor of the State of Hawaii, the State of Hawaii Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism, the Division of Consumer Advocacy of the State of Hawaii Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs and the electric utilities (collectively, the parties), signed an Energy Agreement setting forth the goals and objectives of the HCEI and the related commitments of the parties. The Energy Agreement requires the parties to pursue a wide range of actions with the purpose of decreasing the State of Hawaiis dependence on imported fossil fuels through substantial increases in the use of renewable energy and implementation of new programs intended to secure greater energy efficiency and conservation. The far-reaching nature of the Energy Agreement, including the extent of renewable energy commitments, presents new increased risks to the Company. Among such risks are: (1) the dependence on third party suppliers of renewable purchased energy, which if the utilities are unsuccessful in negotiating purchased power agreements with such IPPs or if a major IPP fails to deliver the anticipated capacity in its purchased power agreement, could impact the utilities achievement of its commitments under the Energy Agreement and/or the utilities ability to deliver reliable service; (2) delays in acquiring or unavailability of non-fossil fuel supplies for renewable generation; (3) the impact of intermittent power to the electrical grid and reliability of service if appropriate supporting infrastructure is not installed or does not operate effectively; (4) the likelihood that the utilities may need to make substantial investments in related infrastructure, which could result in increased borrowings and, therefore, materially impact the financial condition and liquidity of the utilities; and (5) the commitment to support a variety of initiatives, which, if approved by the PUC, may have a material impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the utilities depending on their design and implementation. These initiatives include, but are not limited to, removing the system-wide caps on net energy metering (but 32 studying distributed generation interconnections on a per-circuit basis); and developing an Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard. The implementation of these or other HCEI programs may adversely impact the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the electric utilities. Bank Risks. Fluctuations in interest rates could result in lower net interest income, impair ASBs ability to originate new loans or impair the ability of ASBs adjustable-rate borrowers to make increased payments.  Interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASBs operations. ASBs net interest income consists primarily of interest income received on fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, mortgage-related securities and investments and interest expense consisting primarily of interest paid on deposits and other borrowings. Interest rate risk arises when earning assets mature or when their interest rates change in a time frame different from that of the costing liabilities. Changes in market interest rates, including changes in the relationship between short-term and long-term market interest rates or between different interest rate indices, can impact ASBs net interest margin. Although ASB pursues an asset-liability management strategy designed to mitigate its risk from changes in market interest rates, unfavorable movements in interest rates could result in lower net interest income. Residential 1-4 family fixed-rate mortgage loans comprised about 47% of ASBs loan portfolio as of December 31, 2012 and do not re-price with movements in interest rates. ASB continues to face a challenging interest rate environment. The persistent, low level of interest rates and excess liquidity in the financial system have impacted the new loan production rates and made it challenging to find investments with adequate risk-adjusted returns, which resulted in a negative impact on ASBs asset yields and net interest margin. The potential for compression of ASBs margin when interest rates rise is an ongoing concern. Increases in market interest rates could have an adverse impact on ASBs cost of funds. Higher market interest rates could lead to higher interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Significant increases in market interest rates, or the perception that an increase may occur, could adversely affect ASBs ability to originate new loans and grow. An increase in market interest rates, especially a sudden increase, could also adversely affect the ability of ASBs adjustable-rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations. If this occurred, it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets and charge-offs. Conversely, a decrease in interest rates or a mismatching of maturities of interest sensitive financial instruments could result in an acceleration in the prepayment of loans and mortgage-related securities and impact ASBs ability to reinvest its liquidity in similar yielding assets. Historically low interest rates in 2010, 2011 and 2012 resulted in high refinancings, which reduced the level of future interest income. ASBs operations are affected by many disparate factors, some of which are beyond its control, that could result in lower net interest income or decreased demand for its products and services.  ASBs results of operations depend primarily on the level of interest income generated by ASBs earning assets in excess of the interest expense on its costing liabilities and the supply of and demand for its products and services (i.e., loans and deposits). ASBs net income may also be adversely affected by various other factors, such as: · local   and other economic and political conditions that could result in declines in   employment and real estate values, which in turn could adversely affect the   ability of borrowers to make loan payments and the ability of ASB to recover   the full amounts owing to it under defaulted loans;  · the   ability of borrowers to obtain insurance and the ability of ASB to place   insurance where borrowers fail to do so, particularly in the event of   catastrophic damage to collateral securing loans made by ASB;  · faster   than expected loan prepayments that can cause an acceleration of the   amortization of premiums on loans and investments and the impairment of   mortgage servicing assets of ASB;  · changes   in ASBs loan portfolio credit profiles and asset quality, which may increase   or decrease the required level of allowance for loan losses;  · technological   disruptions affecting ASBs operations or financial or operational   difficulties experienced by any outside vendor on whom ASB relies to provide   key components of its business operations, such as business processing,   network access or internet connections;    33 ·                 the impact of potential legislative and regulatory changes affecting capital requirements and increasing oversight of, and reporting by, banks in response to the recent financial crisis and federal bailout of financial institutions;·                 legislative changes regulating the assessment of overdraft, interchange and credit card fees, which will have a negative impact on noninterest income;·                 public opinion about ASB and financial institutions in general, which, if negative, could impact the publics trust and confidence in ASB and adversely affect ASBs ability to attract and retain customers and expose ASB to adverse legal and regulatory consequences;·                 increases in operating costs, inflation and other factors, that exceed increases in ASB s net interest, fee and other income; and·                 the ability of ASB to maintain or increase the level of deposits, ASBs lowest costing funds. Banking and related regulations could result in significant restrictions being imposed on ASBs business or in a requirement that HEI divest ASB.  ASB is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the Department of Treasury, the OCC and the FDIC, and is subject to reserve requirements established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In addition, the FRB is responsible for regulating ASBs holding companies, HEI and ASHI. The regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies to address not only ASBs compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations, but also capital adequacy, asset quality, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity and various other factors.Under certain circumstances, including any determination that ASBs relationship with HEI results in an unsafe and unsound banking practice, these regulatory authorities have the authority to restrict the ability of ASB to transfer assets and to make distributions to its shareholders (including payment of dividends to HEI), or they could seek to require HEI to sever its relationship with or divest its ownership of ASB. Payment by ASB of dividends to HEI may also be restricted by the OCC and FRB under its prompt corrective action regulations or its capital distribution regulations if ASBs capital position deteriorates. In order to maintain its status as a QTL, ASB is required to maintain at least 65% of its assets in qualified thrift investments. Institutions that fail to maintain QTL status are subject to various penalties, including limitations on their activities. In ASBs case, the activities of HEI and HEIs other subsidiaries would also be subject to restrictions, and a failure or inability to comply with those restrictions could effectively result in the required divestiture of ASB. Federal legislation has also been proposed in the past that could result in a required divestiture of ASB. In the event of a required divestiture, federal law substantially limits the types of entities that could potentially acquire ASB. Recent legislative and regulatory initiatives could have an adverse effect on ASBs business.  The Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July 2010, is expected to have a substantial impact on the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes a framework through which regulatory reform will be written and changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies could affect ASB in substantial and unpredictable ways. A major component of the Dodd-Frank Act is the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that has the responsibility for setting and enforcing clear, consistent rules relating to consumer financial products and services and has the authority to prohibit practices it finds to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. Compliance with any such directives could have adverse effects on ASBs revenues or operating costs. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on ASBs business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. A large percentage of ASBs loans and securities are collateralized by real estate, and adverse changes in the real estate market and/or general economic conditions may result in loan losses and adversely affect the Companys profitability.  As of December 31, 2012 approximately 78% of ASBs loan portfolio was comprised of loans primarily collateralized by real estate, most of which was concentrated in the State of Hawaii. ASBs HELOC (home equity line of credit) portfolio grew by 18% during 2012 and now comprises 21% of total real estate loans. ASBs financial results may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions, either nationally or in the state of Hawaii, including decreases in real estate values, adverse employment conditions, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal and state government and other significant external 34 events. A deterioration of the economic environment in Hawaii, including a material decline in the real estate market, further declines in home resales, or a material external shock, may significantly impair the value of ASBs collateral and ASBs ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. In the event of a default, amounts received upon sale of the collateral may be insufficient to recover outstanding principal and interest. Adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans. In addition, if poor economic conditions result in decreased demand for real estate loans, ASBs profits may decrease if alternative investments earn less income than real estate loans. ASBs strategy to expand its commercial and commercial real estate lending activities may result in higher service costs and greater credit risk than residential lending activities due to the unique characteristics of these markets.  ASB has been aggressively pursuing a strategy that includes expanding its commercial and commercial real estate lines of business. These types of loans generally entail higher underwriting and other service costs and present greater credit risks than traditional residential mortgages.Generally, both commercial and commercial real estate loans have shorter terms to maturity and earn higher spreads than residential mortgage loans. Only the assets of the business typically secure commercial loans. In such cases, upon default, any collateral repossessed may not be sufficient to repay the outstanding loan balance. In addition, loan collections are dependent on the borrowers continuing financial stability and, thus, are more likely to be affected by current economic conditions and adverse business developments.ASB has grown its national syndicated lending portfolio where ASB is a participant in credit facilities agented by established and reputable national lenders. Management selectively chooses each deal based on conservative credit criteria to ensure a high quality, well diversified portfolio.Commercial real estate properties tend to be unique and are more difficult to value than residential real estate properties. Commercial real estate loans may not be fully amortizing, meaning that they may have a significant principal balance or balloon payment due at maturity. In addition, commercial real estate properties, particularly industrial and warehouse properties, are generally subject to relatively greater environmental risks than noncommercial properties and to the corresponding burdens and costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Also, there may be costs and delays involved in enforcing rights of a property owner against tenants in default under the terms of leases with respect to commercial properties. For example, a tenant may seek the protection of bankruptcy laws, which could result in termination of the tenants lease.In addition to the inherent risks of commercial and commercial real estate lending described above, the expansion of these new lines of business present execution risks, including the ability of ASB to attract personnel experienced in underwriting such loans and the ability of ASB to appropriately evaluate credit risk associated with such loans in determining the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses. "
15,HE,HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC INDS,2012-02-17,"ITEM 1A.        RISK FACTORSThe businesses of HEI and its subsidiaries involve numerous risks which, if realized, could have a material and adverse effect on the Companys financial statements. For additional information for certain risk factors enumerated below and other risks of the Company and its operations, see Forward-Looking Statements above and HEIs MD&A, HEIs Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, HEIs Consolidated Financial Statements, HECOs MD&A, HECOs Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and HECOs Consolidated Financial Statements. Holding Company and Company-Wide Risks. HEI is a holding company that derives its income from its operating subsidiaries and depends on the ability of those subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI and on its own ability to raise capital.  HEI is a legal entity separate and distinct from its various subsidiaries. As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, HEIs cash flows and consequent ability to service its obligations and pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon its receipt of dividends or other distributions from its operating subsidiaries and its ability to issue common stock or other equity securities and to incur additional debt. The ability of HEIs subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI, in turn, is subject to the risks associated with their operations and to contractual and regulatory restrictions, including:·                  the provisions of an HEI agreement with the PUC, which could limit the ability of HEIs principal electric public utility subsidiary, HECO, to pay dividends to HEI in the event that the consolidated common stock equity of the electric public utility subsidiaries falls below 35% of total capitalization of the electric utilities;·                  the provisions of an HEI agreement entered into with federal bank regulators in connection with its acquisition of its bank subsidiary, ASB, which require HEI to contribute additional capital to ASB (up to a maximum amount of additional capital of $28.3 million as of December 31, 2011) upon request of the regulators in order to maintain ASBs regulatory capital at the level required by regulation;·                  the minimum capital and capital distribution regulations of the OCC that are applicable to ASB;·                  the receipt of a letter from the OCC and FRB stating it has no objection to the payment of any dividend ASB proposes to declare and pay to HEI; and·                  the provisions of preferred stock resolutions and debt instruments of HEI and its subsidiaries. 26 The Company is subject to risks associated with the Hawaii economy (in the aggregate and on an individual island basis), volatile U.S. capital markets and changes in the interest rate and credit market environment that have and/or could result in higher retirement benefit plan funding requirements, declines in electric utility KWH sales, declines in ASBs interest rate margins and investment values, higher delinquencies and charge-offs in ASBs loan portfolio and restrictions on the ability of HEI or its subsidiaries to borrow money or issue securities.  The two largest components of Hawaiis economy are tourism and the federal government (including the military). Because the core businesses of HEIs subsidiaries are providing local public electric utility services (through HECO and its subsidiaries) and banking services (through ASB) in Hawaii, the Companys operating results are significantly influenced by Hawaiis economy, which in turn is influenced by economic conditions in the mainland U.S. (particularly California) and Asia (particularly Japan) as a result of the impact of those conditions on tourism, by the impact of interest rates on the construction and real estate industries and by the impact of world conditions (e.g., U.S. presence in Afghanistan) on federal government spending in Hawaii. For example, the turmoil in the financial markets and declines in the national and global economies had a negative effect on the Hawaii economy in 2009. In 2009, declines in the Hawaii, U.S. and Asian economies in turn led to declines in KWH sales (which continued into 2010 and 2011), an increase in uncollected billings of HECO and its subsidiaries, higher delinquencies in ASBs loan portfolio and other adverse effects on HEIs businesses.If S&P or Moodys were to downgrade HEIs or HECOs long-term debt ratings because of past adverse effects, or if future events were to adversely affect the availability of capital to the Company, HEIs and HECOs ability to borrow and raise capital could be constrained and their future borrowing costs would likely increase with resulting reductions in HEIs consolidated net income in future periods. Further, if HEIs or HECOs commercial paper ratings were to be downgraded, HEI and HECO might not be able to sell commercial paper and might be required to draw on more expensive bank lines of credit or to defer capital or other expenditures.Changes in the U.S. capital markets can also have significant effects on the Company. For example, pension funding requirements are affected by the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for pension plans, and by the discount rate used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost and value obligations. The electric utilities pension tracking mechanisms help moderate pension expense; however, the significant decline in 2008 in the value of the Companys defined benefit pension plan assets resulted in a substantial gap between the projected benefit obligations under the plans and the value of plan assets, resulting in increases in funding requirements.Because the earnings of ASB depend primarily on net interest income, interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASBs operations. HEI and its electric utility subsidiaries are also exposed to interest rate risk primarily due to their periodic borrowing requirements, the discount rate used to determine pension funding requirements and the possible effect of interest rates on the electric utilities rates of return. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors, including general economic conditions and the policies of government and regulatory authorities. HEI cannot predict future changes in interest rates, nor be certain that interest rate risk management strategies it or its subsidiaries have implemented will be successful in managing interest rate risk.Interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting the fair value of ASBs investment securities. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair values of those instruments, respectively. Disruptions in the credit markets, a liquidity crisis in the banking industry or increased levels of residential mortgage delinquencies and defaults may result in decreases in the fair value of ASBs investment securities and an impairment that is other-than-temporary, requiring ASB to write down its investment securities. As of December 31, 2011, 90% of ASBs investment securities were securities and obligations issued by a federal agency or government sponsored entity that have an implicit guarantee from the U.S. government. 27 HEI and HECO and their subsidiaries may incur higher retirement benefits expenses and have and will likely continue to recognize substantial liabilities for retirement benefits.  Retirement benefits expenses and cash funding requirements could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the U.S. equity markets, trends in interest rates and health care costs, plan amendments, new laws relating to pension funding and changes in accounting principles. For the electric utilities, however, retirement benefits expenses, as adjusted by the pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions (OPEB) tracking mechanisms, have been an allowable expense for rate-making purposes. The Company is subject to the risks associated with the geographic concentration of its businesses and current lack of interconnections that could result in service interruptions at the electric utilities or higher default rates on loans held by ASB.  The business of HECO and its electric utility subsidiaries is concentrated on the individual islands they serve in the State of Hawaii. Their operations are more vulnerable to service interruptions than are many U.S. mainland utilities because none of the systems of HECO and its subsidiaries are interconnected with the systems on the other islands they serve. Because of this lack of interconnections, it is necessary to maintain higher generation reserve margins than are typical for U.S. mainland utilities to help ensure reliable service. Service interruptions, including in particular extended interruptions that could result from a natural disaster or terrorist activity, could adversely impact the KWH sales of some or all of the electric utility subsidiaries.Substantially all of ASBs consumer loan customers are Hawaii residents. A significant portion of the commercial loan customers are located in Hawaii. While a majority of customers are on Oahu, ASB also has customers on the neighbor islands (whose economies have been weaker than Oahu during the recent economic downturn). Substantially all of the real estate underlying ASBs residential and commercial real estate loans are located in Hawaii. These assets may be subject to a greater risk of default than other comparable assets held by financial institutions with other geographic concentrations in the event of adverse economic, political or business developments or natural disasters affecting Hawaii and the ability of ASBs customers to make payments of principal and interest on their loans. Increasing competition and technological advances could cause HEIs businesses to lose customers or render their operations obsolete.  The banking industry in Hawaii, and certain aspects of the electric utility industry, are competitive. The success of HEIs subsidiaries in meeting competition and responding to technological advances will continue to have a direct impact on HEIs consolidated financial performance. For example:·                  ASB, one of the largest financial institutions in the state, is in direct competition for deposits and loans not only with two larger institutions that have substantial capital, technology and marketing resources, but also with smaller Hawaii institutions and other U.S. institutions, including credit unions, mutual funds, mortgage brokers, finance companies and investment banking firms. Larger financial institutions may have greater access to capital at lower costs, which could impair ASBs ability to compete effectively. Significant advances in technology could render the operations of ASB less competitive or obsolete.·                  HECO and its subsidiaries face competition from IPPs and customer self-generation, with or without cogeneration. With the exception of certain identified projects, the utilities are required to use competitive bidding to acquire a future generation resource unless the PUC finds competitive bidding to be unsuitable. The PUC set policies for DG interconnection agreements and standby rates, and established conditions under which electric utilities can provide DG services on customer-owned sites as a regulated service. The electric utilities cannot predict the future impact of competition from IPPs and customer self-generation, or the rate at which technological developments facilitating non-utility generation of electricity will occur.·                  New technological developments, such as the commercial development of energy storage, may render the operations of HEIs electric utility subsidiaries less competitive or outdated. 28  The Company may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security that could adversely affect its businesses and reputation.  The Company is subject to cyber security risks and the potential for cyber incidents, including potential incidents at ASB branches and at the HECO, HELCO and MECO plants and the related electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure, and incidents at data processing centers they use, to the extent not prevented by intrusion detection and prevention systems, anti-virus software, firewalls and other general information technology controls. ASB and HECO are highly dependent on their ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions. ASB and the utilities rely heavily on numerous data processing systems. If any of these systems fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time, the Company could suffer financial loss, business disruptions, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or damage to its reputation. The utilities and ASB have disaster recovery plans in place to protect their businesses against natural disasters, security breaches, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures or similar events. The disaster recovery plans, however, may not be successful in preventing the loss of customer data, service interruptions, disruptions to operations or damage to important facilities. HEIs businesses could suffer losses that are uninsured due to a lack of affordable insurance coverage, unavailability of insurance coverage or limitations on the insurance coverage the Company does have.  In the ordinary course of business, HEI and its subsidiaries purchase insurance coverages (e.g., property and liability coverages) to protect against loss of, or damage to, their properties and against claims made by third parties and employees for property damage or personal injuries. However, the protection provided by such insurance is limited in significant respects and, in some instances, there is no coverage. Certain of the insurance has substantial deductibles or has limits on the maximum amounts that may be recovered. For example, the electric utilities overhead and underground transmission and distribution systems (with the exception of substation buildings and contents) have a replacement value roughly estimated at $5 billion and are not insured against loss or damage because the amount of transmission and distribution system insurance available is limited and the premiums are cost prohibitive. Similarly, the electric utilities have no business interruption insurance as the premiums for such insurance would be cost prohibitive, particularly since the utilities are not interconnected to other systems. If a hurricane or other uninsured catastrophic natural disaster were to occur, and if the PUC were not to allow the affected electric utilities to recover from ratepayers restoration costs and revenues lost from business interruption, the lost revenues and repair expenses could result in a significant decrease in HEIs consolidated net income or in significant net losses for the affected periods.ASB generally does not obtain credit enhancements, such as mortgagor bankruptcy insurance, but does require standard hazard and hurricane insurance and may require flood insurance for certain properties. ASB is subject to the risks of borrower defaults and bankruptcies, special hazard losses not covered by the required insurance and the insurance companys inability to pay claims on existing policies. Increased federal and state environmental regulation will require an increasing commitment of resources and funds and could result in construction delays or penalties and fines for non-compliance. HEI and its subsidiaries are subject to federal and state environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety, which regulate the operation of existing facilities, the construction and operation of new facilities and the proper cleanup and disposal of hazardous waste and toxic substances. Compliance with these legal requirements requires HEIs utility subsidiaries to commit significant resources and funds toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment and payment of emission fees. These laws and regulations, among other things, require that certain environmental permits be obtained in order to construct or operate certain facilities, and obtaining such permits can entail significant expense and cause substantial construction delays. Also, these laws and regulations may be amended from time to time, including amendments that increase the burden and expense of compliance. For example, emission and/or discharge limits may be tightened, more extensive permitting requirements may be imposed and additional substances may become regulated. In addition, significant regulatory uncertainty exists regarding the impact of federal or state greenhouse gas emission limits and reductions. 29 If HEI or its subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond their control, that failure may result in civil or criminal penalties and fines. Adverse tax rulings or developments could result in significant increases in tax payments and/or expense.  Governmental taxing authorities could challenge a tax return position taken by HEI or its subsidiaries and, if the taxing authorities prevail, HEIs consolidated tax payments and/or expense, including applicable penalties and interest, could increase significantly. The Company could be subject to the risk of uninsured losses in excess of its accruals for litigation matters.  HEI and its subsidiaries are involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of their businesses, most of which is covered by insurance (subject to policy limits and deductibles). However, other litigation may arise that is not routine or involves claims that may not be covered by insurance. Because of the uncertainties associated with litigation, there is a risk that litigation against HEI or its subsidiaries, even if vigorously defended, could result in costs of defense and judgment or settlement amounts not covered by insurance and in excess of reserves established in HEIs consolidated financial statements. Changes in accounting principles and estimates could affect the reported amounts of the Companys assets and liabilities or revenues and expenses.  HEIs consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Changes in these principles, or changes in the Companys application of existing accounting principles, could materially affect the financial statement presentation of HEIs or the electric utilities consolidated results of operations and/or financial condition. Further, in preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the amounts reported for investment and mortgage-related securities; property, plant and equipment; pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; contingencies and litigation; income taxes; regulatory assets and liabilities; electric utility revenues; and allowance for loan losses.HECO and its subsidiaries financial statements reflect assets and costs based on cost-based rate-making regulations. Continued accounting in this manner requires that certain criteria relating to the recoverability of such costs through rates be met. If events or circumstances should change so that the criteria are no longer satisfied, the electric utilities regulatory assets (amounting to $669 million as of December 31, 2011) may need to be charged to expense, which could result in significant reductions in the electric utilities net income, and the electric utilities regulatory liabilities (amounting to $315 million as of December 31, 2011) may need to be refunded to ratepayers immediately.Changes in accounting principles can also impact HEIs consolidated financial statements. For example, if management determines that a PPA requires the consolidation of the IPP in HECOs consolidated financial statements, the consolidation could have a material effect on HECOs and HEIs consolidated financial statements, including the recognition of a significant amount of assets and liabilities and, if such a consolidated IPP were operating at a loss and had insufficient equity, the potential recognition of such losses. Also, if management determines that a PPA requires the classification of the agreement as a capital lease, a material effect on HEIs consolidated balance sheet may result, including the recognition of significant capital assets and lease obligations. 30 Electric Utility Risks. Actions of the PUC are outside the control of the electric utility subsidiaries and could result in inadequate or untimely rate increases, in rate reductions or refunds or in unanticipated delays, expenses or writedowns in connection with the construction of new projects.  The rates the electric utilities are allowed to charge for their services and the timeliness of permitted rate increases are among the most important items influencing the electric utilities results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The PUC has broad discretion over the rates that the electric utilities charge their customers. The electric utilities currently have rate cases pending before the PUC. In addition, as part of the decoupling mechanism that the electric utilities have or will be implementing, each of the electric utilities will alternately file a rate case once every three years. Any adverse decision by the PUC concerning the level or method of determining electric utility rates, the items and amounts that may be included in rate base, the returns on equity or rate base found to be reasonable, the potential consequences of exceeding or not meeting such returns, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding, could have a material adverse effect on HECOs consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.To improve the timing and certainty of the recovery of their costs, the electric utilities have proposed and received approval of various cost recovery mechanisms including an ECAC, and more recently a decoupling mechanism, a PPAC, and a renewable energy infrastructure program surcharge.The electric utilities could be required to refund to their customers, with interest, revenues that have been or may be received under interim rate orders in their rate case proceedings, integrated resource plan cost recovery dockets and other proceedings, if and to the extent they exceed the amounts allowed in final orders.Many public utility projects require PUC approval and various permits (e.g., environmental and land use permits) from other governmental agencies. Difficulties in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, the necessary approvals or permits, or any adverse decision or policy made or adopted, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision, by an agency with respect to such approvals and permits, can result in significantly increased project costs or even cancellation of projects. For example, HECOs East Oahu Transmission Project encountered substantial opposition and consequent delay, increased costs and a subsequent partial write-off of costs in the fourth quarter of 2011. In the event a project does not proceed, or if the PUC disallows cost recovery for all or part of a project, project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could result in significant reductions in HECOs consolidated net income. Energy cost adjustment clauses. The rate schedules of each of HEIs electric utilities include ECACs under which electric rates charged to customers are automatically adjusted for changes in the weighted-average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power, and the relative amounts of company-generated power and purchased power.The Energy Agreement confirms the intent of the parties that the existing ECACs will continue, but subject to periodic review by the PUC. The Energy Agreement also provides that as part of the review, the PUC may examine whether there are renewable energy projects from which the utilities should have, but did not, purchase energy or whether alternative fuel purchase strategies were appropriately used or not used.In the recent rate cases, the PUC has allowed the current ECAC to continue. However, a change in, or the elimination of, the ECAC could have a material adverse effect on the electric utilities. Electric utility operations are significantly influenced by weather conditions.  The electric utilities results of operations can be affected by the weather. Weather conditions, particularly temperature and humidity, directly influence the demand for electricity. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis and lightning storms, which may become more severe or frequent as a result of global warming, can cause outages and property damage and require the utilities to incur significant additional expenses that may not be recoverable. 31 Electric utility operations depend heavily on third-party suppliers of fuel and purchased power.  The electric utilities rely on fuel oil suppliers and shippers and IPPs to deliver fuel oil and power, respectively, in accordance with contractual agreements. Approximately 76% of the net energy generated or purchased by the electric utilities in 2011 was generated from the burning of fossil fuel oil, and purchases of power by the electric utilities provided about 40% of their total net energy generated and purchased for the same period. Failure or delay by oil suppliers and shippers to provide fuel pursuant to existing contracts, or failure by a major IPP to deliver the firm capacity anticipated in its PPA, could disrupt the ability of the electric utilities to deliver electricity and require the electric utilities to incur additional expenses to meet the needs of their customers that may not be recoverable. In addition, as these contractual agreements end, the electric utilities may not be able to purchase fuel and power on terms equivalent to the current contractual agreements. Further, as the use of biofuels in generating units increases, the same risks will exist with suppliers of biofuels. Electric utility generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated and/or increased operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs.  Operation of electric generating facilities involves certain risks which can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels. Included among these risks are facility shutdowns or power interruptions due to insufficient generation or a breakdown or failure of equipment or processes or interruptions in fuel supply, inability to negotiate satisfactory collective bargaining agreements when existing agreements expire or other labor disputes, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements, disruptions in delivery of electricity, operator error and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, fires, explosions, floods or other similar occurrences affecting the electric utilities generating facilities or transmission and distribution systems. The utilities have taken a number of steps to mitigate the risk of outages, including securing additional purchased power, adding new utility generation, adding distributed generation and encouraging energy conservation. The costs of supplying energy to meet high demand and maintenance costs required to sustain high availability of aging generation units have been increasing and the trend of cost increases is not likely to ease, putting pressure on earnings to the extent timely cost recovery is not achieved. The electric utilities may be adversely affected by new legislation.  Congress and the Hawaii Legislature periodically consider legislation that could have uncertain or negative effects on the electric utilities and their customers. The Hawaii Legislature has adopted a number of measures that will significantly affect the electric utilities, as described below. Renewable Portfolio Standards law.  In 2009, Hawaiis RPS law was amended to require electric utilities to meet an RPS of 10%, 15%, 25% and 40% by December 31, 2010, 2015, 2020 and 2030, respectively. Energy savings resulting from energy efficiency programs will not count toward the RPS after 2014. The utilities are committed to achieving these goals and met the 2010 RPS; however, due to the exclusion of energy savings in calculating RPS after 2014 and risks such as potential delays in IPPs being able to deliver contracted renewable energy, it is possible the electric utilities may not attain the required renewable percentages in the future, and management cannot predict the future consequences of failure to do so (including potential penalties to be assessed by the PUC). On December 19, 2008, the PUC approved a penalty of $20 for every MWh that an electric utility is deficient under Hawaiis RPS law. The PUC noted, however, that this penalty may be reduced, in the PUCs discretion, due to events or circumstances that are outside an electric utilitys reasonable control, to the extent the event or circumstance could not be reasonably foreseen and ameliorated, as described in the RPS law and in an RPS framework. In addition, the PUC ordered that the utilities will be prohibited from recovering any RPS penalty costs through rates. 32 Renewable energy.  In 2007, a measure was passed by the Hawaii legislature stating that the PUC may consider the need for increased renewable energy in rendering decisions on utility matters. Due to this measure, it is possible that, if energy from a renewable source were more expensive than energy from fossil fuel, the PUC may still approve the purchase of energy from the renewable source, resulting in higher costs. Global climate change and greenhouse gas emissions reduction.  National and international concern about climate change and the contribution of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to global warming have led to action by the state of Hawaii and federal legislative and regulatory proposals to reduce GHG emissions.In July 2007, Act 234, which requires a statewide reduction of GHG emissions by January 1, 2020 to levels at or below the statewide GHG emission levels in 1990, became law in Hawaii.In recent years, several approaches to GHG emission reduction (including cap and trade) have been either introduced or discussed in Congress; however, no legislation has yet been enacted.In response to the 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, which ruled that the EPA has the authority to regulate GHG emissions from motor vehicles under the CAA, the EPA has accelerated rulemaking addressing GHG emissions from both mobile and stationary sources. On September 22, 2009, the EPA issued the Final Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule. The rule, which applies to HECO, HELCO and MECO, requires that sources above certain threshold levels monitor GHG emissions.On June 3, 2010, the EPAs final Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Tailoring Rule (GHG Tailoring Rule) was published. It creates a new emissions threshold for GHG emissions from new and existing facilities. The utilities are evaluating the impact of the GHG Tailoring Rule and a three-year permit deferral for biomass-fired and other biogenic sources on the utilities operations. At this time, it is not possible to predict with certainty the impact on the utilities of the foregoing legislation or legislation that now is, or may in the future be, proposed. The electric utilities may be subject to increased operational challenges and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely impacted in meeting the commitments and objectives of the HCEI Energy Agreement.  On October 20, 2008, the Governor of the State of Hawaii, the State of Hawaii Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism, the Division of Consumer Advocacy of the State of Hawaii Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs and the electric utilities (collectively, the parties), signed an Energy Agreement setting forth the goals and objectives of the HCEI and the related commitments of the parties. The Energy Agreement requires the parties to pursue a wide range of actions with the purpose of decreasing the State of Hawaiis dependence on imported fossil fuels through substantial increases in the use of renewable energy and implementation of new programs intended to secure greater energy efficiency and conservation.The far-reaching nature of the Energy Agreement, including the extent of renewable energy commitments, presents new increased risks to the Company. Among such risks are: (1) the dependence on third party suppliers of renewable purchased energy, which if the utilities are unsuccessful in negotiating purchased power agreements with such IPPs or if a major IPP fails to deliver the anticipated capacity in its purchased power agreement, could impact the utilities achievement of its commitments under the Energy Agreement and/or the utilities ability to deliver reliable service; (2) delays in acquiring or unavailability of non-fossil fuel supplies for renewable generation; (3) the impact of intermittent power to the electrical grid and reliability of service if appropriate supporting infrastructure is not installed or does not operate effectively; (4) the likelihood that the utilities may need to make substantial investments in related infrastructure, which could result in increased borrowings and, therefore, materially impact the financial condition and liquidity of the utilities; and (5) the commitment to support a variety of initiatives, which, if approved by the PUC, may have a material impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the utilities depending on their design and implementation. Programs include, but are not limited to, decoupling revenues from sales; implementing feed-in tariffs to encourage development of renewable energy; removing the system-wide caps on net energy metering (but studying distributed generation interconnections on a per-circuit basis); and developing an Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard. Management cannot predict the ultimate impact or outcome of the implementation of these or other HCEI programs on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the electric utilities. 33 Bank Risks. Fluctuations in interest rates could result in lower net interest income, impair ASBs ability to originate new loans or impair the ability of ASBs adjustable-rate borrowers to make increased payments.  Interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASBs operations. ASBs net interest income consists primarily of interest income received on fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, mortgage-related securities and investments and interest expense consisting primarily of interest paid on deposits and other borrowings. Interest rate risk arises when earning assets mature or when their interest rates change in a time frame different from that of the costing liabilities. Changes in market interest rates, including changes in the relationship between short-term and long-term market interest rates or between different interest rate indices, can impact ASBs net interest margin.Although ASB pursues an asset-liability management strategy designed to mitigate its risk from changes in market interest rates, unfavorable movements in interest rates could result in lower net interest income. Residential 1-4 family fixed-rate mortgage loans comprised about 50% of ASBs loan portfolio as of December 31, 2011 and do not re-price with movements in interest rates. ASB continues to face a challenging interest rate environment. The persistent, low level of interest rates and excess liquidity in the financial system have impacted the new loan production rates and made it challenging to find investments with adequate risk-adjusted returns, which resulted in a negative impact on ASBs asset yields and net interest margin. The potential for compression of ASBs margin when interest rates rise is an ongoing concern.Increases in market interest rates could have an adverse impact on ASBs cost of funds. Higher market interest rates could lead to higher interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Significant increases in market interest rates, or the perception that an increase may occur, could adversely affect ASBs ability to originate new loans and grow. An increase in market interest rates, especially a sudden increase, could also adversely affect the ability of ASBs adjustable-rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations. If this occurred, it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets and charge-offs. Conversely, a decrease in interest rates or a mismatching of maturities of interest sensitive financial instruments could result in an acceleration in the prepayment of loans and mortgage-related securities and impact ASBs ability to reinvest its liquidity in similar yielding assets. Historically low interest rates in 2009, 2010 and 2011 resulted in high refinancings, which reduced the level of future interest income. ASBs operations are affected by many disparate factors, some of which are beyond its control, that could result in lower net interest income or decreased demand for its products and services.  ASBs results of operations depend primarily on the level of interest income generated by ASBs earning assets in excess of the interest expense on its costing liabilities and the supply of and demand for its products and services (i.e., loans and deposits). ASBs net income may also be adversely affected by various other factors, such as: ·                  local and other economic and political conditions that could result in declines in employment and real estate values, which in turn could adversely affect the ability of borrowers to make loan payments and the ability of ASB to recover the full amounts owing to it under defaulted loans;·                  the ability of borrowers to obtain insurance and the ability of ASB to place insurance where borrowers fail to do so, particularly in the event of catastrophic damage to collateral securing loans made by ASB;·                  faster than expected loan prepayments that can cause an acceleration of the amortization of premiums on loans and investments and the impairment of mortgage servicing assets of ASB;·                  changes in ASBs loan portfolio credit profiles and asset quality, which may increase or decrease the required level of allowance for loan losses;·                  technological disruptions affecting ASBs operations or financial or operational difficulties experienced by any outside vendor on whom ASB relies to provide key components of its business operations, such as business processing, network access or internet connections;·                  the impact of potential legislative and regulatory changes affecting capital requirements and increasing oversight of, and reporting by, banks in response to the recent financial crisis and federal bailout of financial institutions;·                  legislative changes regulating the assessment of overdraft, interchange and credit card fees, which will have a negative impact on noninterest income; 34 ·                  public opinion about ASB and financial institutions in general, which, if negative, could impact the publics trust and confidence in ASB and adversely affect ASBs ability to attract and retain customers and expose ASB to adverse legal and regulatory consequences;·                  increases in operating costs, inflation and other factors, that exceed increases in ASB s net interest, fee and other income; and·                  the ability of ASB to maintain or increase the level of deposits, ASBs lowest costing funds. Banking and related regulations could result in significant restrictions being imposed on ASBs business or in a requirement that HEI divest ASB.  ASB is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the Department of Treasury, the OCC and the FDIC, and is subject to reserve requirements established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In addition, the FRB is responsible for regulating ASBs holding companies, HEI and ASHI. The regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies to address not only ASBs compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations, but also capital adequacy, asset quality, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity and various other factors.Under certain circumstances, including any determination that ASBs relationship with HEI results in an unsafe and unsound banking practice, these regulatory authorities have the authority to restrict the ability of ASB to transfer assets and to make distributions to its shareholders (including payment of dividends to HEI), or they could seek to require HEI to sever its relationship with or divest its ownership of ASB. Payment by ASB of dividends to HEI may also be restricted by the OCC and FRB under its prompt corrective action regulations or its capital distribution regulations if ASBs capital position deteriorates. In order to maintain its status as a QTL, ASB is required to maintain at least 65% of its assets in qualified thrift investments. Institutions that fail to maintain QTL status are subject to various penalties, including limitations on their activities. In ASBs case, the activities of HEI and HEIs other subsidiaries would also be subject to restrictions, and a failure or inability to comply with those restrictions could effectively result in the required divestiture of ASB. Federal legislation has also been proposed in the past that could result in a required divestiture of ASB. In the event of a required divestiture, federal law substantially limits the types of entities that could potentially acquire ASB. Recent legislative and regulatory initiatives could have an adverse effect on ASBs business.  The Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July 2010, is expected to have a substantial impact on the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes a framework through which regulatory reform will be written and changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies could affect ASB in substantial and unpredictable ways. A major component of the Dodd-Frank Act is the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that has the responsibility for setting and enforcing clear, consistent rules relating to consumer financial products and services and has the authority to prohibit practices it finds to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. Compliance with any such directives could have adverse effects on ASBs revenues or operating costs. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on ASBs business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. A large percentage of ASBs loans and securities are collateralized by real estate, and adverse changes in the real estate market and/or general economic conditions may result in loan losses and adversely affect the Companys profitability.  As of December 31, 2011 approximately 78% of ASBs loan portfolio was comprised of loans primarily collateralized by real estate, most of which was concentrated in the State of Hawaii. ASBs HELOC (home equity line of credit) portfolio grew by 29% during 2011 and now comprises 19% of total real estate loans. ASBs financial results may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions, either nationally or in the state of Hawaii, including decreases in real estate values, adverse employment conditions, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal and state government and other significant external events. A deterioration of the economic environment in Hawaii, including a material decline in the real estate market, further declines in home resales, or a material external shock, may significantly impair the value of ASBs collateral and ASBs ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. In the event of a default, amounts received upon sale of the collateral may be insufficient to recover outstanding principal and interest. Adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely 35 repayments of their loans. In addition, if poor economic conditions result in decreased demand for real estate loans, ASBs profits may decrease if alternative investments earn less income than real estate loans. ASBs strategy to expand its commercial and commercial real estate lending activities may result in higher service costs and greater credit risk than residential lending activities due to the unique characteristics of these markets.  ASB has been aggressively pursuing a strategy that includes expanding its commercial and commercial real estate lines of business. These types of loans generally entail higher underwriting and other service costs and present greater credit risks than traditional residential mortgages.Generally, both commercial and commercial real estate loans have shorter terms to maturity and earn higher spreads than residential mortgage loans. Only the assets of the business typically secure commercial loans. In such cases, upon default, any collateral repossessed may not be sufficient to repay the outstanding loan balance. In addition, loan collections are dependent on the borrowers continuing financial stability and, thus, are more likely to be affected by current economic conditions and adverse business developments.ASB has grown its national syndicated lending portfolio where ASB is a participant in credit facilities agented by established and reputable national lenders. Management selectively chooses each deal based on conservative credit criteria to ensure a high quality, well diversified portfolio.Commercial real estate properties tend to be unique and are more difficult to value than residential real estate properties. Commercial real estate loans may not be fully amortizing, meaning that they may have a significant principal balance or balloon payment due at maturity. In addition, commercial real estate properties, particularly industrial and warehouse properties, are generally subject to relatively greater environmental risks than noncommercial properties and to the corresponding burdens and costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Also, there may be costs and delays involved in enforcing rights of a property owner against tenants in default under the terms of leases with respect to commercial properties. For example, a tenant may seek the protection of bankruptcy laws, which could result in termination of the tenants lease.In addition to the inherent risks of commercial and commercial real estate lending described above, the expansion of these new lines of business present execution risks, including the ability of ASB to attract personnel experienced in underwriting such loans and the ability of ASB to appropriately evaluate credit risk associated with such loans in determining the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses. "
11,HE,HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC INDS,2011-02-18,"ITEM 1A.             RISK FACTORS For additional information for certain risk factors enumerated below and other risks of the Company and its operations, see Forward-Looking Statements above and HEIs MD&A, HEIs Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Item 7A, HEIs Consolidated Financial Statements, HECOs MD&A, HECOs Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in Exhibit 99.2 and HECOs Consolidated Financial Statements. Holding Company and Company-Wide Risks. HEI is a holding company that derives its income from its operating subsidiaries and depends on the ability of those subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI and on its own ability to raise capital.  HEI is a legal entity separate and distinct from its various subsidiaries. As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, HEIs cash flows and consequent ability to service its obligations and pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon its receipt of dividends or other distributions from its operating subsidiaries and its ability to issue common stock or other equity securities and to incur additional debt. The ability of HEIs subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI, in turn, is subject to the risks associated with their operations and to contractual and regulatory restrictions, including: ·                  the provisions of an HEI agreement with the PUC, which could limit the ability of HEIs principal electric public utility subsidiary, HECO, to pay dividends to HEI in the event that the consolidated common stock equity of the electric public utility subsidiaries falls below 35% of total capitalization of the electric utilities;·                  the provisions of an HEI agreement entered into with federal bank regulators in connection with its acquisition of its bank subsidiary, ASB, which require HEI to contribute additional capital to ASB (up to a maximum amount of additional capital of $28.3 million as of December 31, 2010) upon request of the regulators in order to maintain ASBs regulatory capital at the level required by regulation;·                  the minimum capital and capital distribution regulations of the OTS that are applicable to ASB;·                  the receipt of a letter from the OTS stating it has no objection to the payment of any dividend ASB proposes to declare and pay to HEI; and·                  the provisions of preferred stock resolutions and debt instruments of HEI and its subsidiaries. The Company is subject to risks associated with the Hawaii economy (in the aggregate and on an individual island basis), volatile U.S. capital markets and changes in the interest rate and credit market environment that have and/or could result in higher retirement benefit plan funding requirements, declines in electric utility KWH sales, declines in ASBs interest rate margins and investment values, higher delinquencies and charge-offs in ASBs loan portfolio and restrictions on the ability of HEI or its subsidiaries to borrow money or issue securities.  The two largest components of Hawaiis economy are tourism and the federal government (including the military). Because the core businesses of HEIs subsidiaries are providing local public electric utility services (through HECO and its subsidiaries) and banking services (through ASB and its subsidiaries) in Hawaii, the Companys operating results are significantly influenced by Hawaiis economy, which in turn is influenced by economic conditions in the mainland U.S. (particularly California) and Asia (particularly Japan) as a result of the impact of those conditions on tourism, by the impact of interest rates on the construction and real estate industries and by the impact of world conditions (e.g., U.S. presence in Afghanistan) on federal government spending in Hawaii. The turmoil in the financial markets and declines in the national and global economies had a negative effect on the Hawaii economy in 2009. In 2009, declines in the Hawaii, U.S. and Asian economies, led to declines in KWH sales (which continued into 2010), an increase in uncollected billings of HECO and its subsidiaries, higher delinquencies in ASBs loan portfolio and other adverse effects on HEIs businesses. Both the U. S. and Hawaii economies, however, experienced growth in 2010. The utilities 2011 KWH sales are currently expected to increase by 2.4% from 2010. If S&P or Moodys were to downgrade HEIs or HECOs long-term debt ratings because of past adverse effects, or if future events were to adversely affect the availability of capital to the Company, HEIs and HECOs ability to borrow and raise capital could be constrained and their future borrowing costs would likely increase with resulting reductions in HEIs consolidated net income in future periods. Further, 28Table of Contents if HEIs or HECOs commercial paper ratings were to be further downgraded, HEI and HECO might not be able to sell commercial paper and might be required to draw on more expensive bank lines of credit or to defer capital or other expenditures. Changes in the U.S. capital markets can also have significant effects on the Company. For example, pension funding requirements are affected by the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for pension plans, and by the discount rate used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost and value obligations. The electric utilities pension tracking mechanisms help moderate pension expense; however, the significant decline in 2008 in the value of the Companys defined benefit pension plan assets resulted in a substantial gap between the projected benefit obligations under the plans and the value of plan assets, resulting in increases in funding requirements. Because the earnings of ASB depend primarily on net interest income, interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASBs operations. HEI and its electric utility subsidiaries are also exposed to interest rate risk primarily due to their periodic borrowing requirements, the discount rate used to determine pension funding requirements and the possible effect of interest rates on the electric utilities rates of return. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors, including general economic conditions and the policies of government and regulatory authorities. HEI cannot predict future changes in interest rates, nor be certain that interest rate risk management strategies it or its subsidiaries have implemented will be successful in managing interest rate risk. Interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting the fair value of ASBs investment securities. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. In 2008 and 2009, the credit markets experienced significant disruptions, liquidity on many financial instruments declined and residential mortgage delinquencies and defaults increased. These disruptions negatively impacted the fair value of ASBs investment portfolio and led ASB, in the fourth quarter of 2009, to sell all private-issue mortgage-related securities in its investment portfolio in order to further improve its credit risk profile and reduce the potential volatility of future earnings. HEI and HECO and their subsidiaries may incur higher retirement benefits expenses and have and will likely continue to recognize substantial liabilities for retirement benefits.  Retirement benefits expenses and cash funding requirements could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the U.S. equity markets, trends in interest rates and health care costs, plan amendments, new laws relating to pension funding and changes in accounting principles. For the electric utilities, however, retirement benefits expenses, as adjusted by the pension and OPEB tracking mechanisms, have been an allowable expense for rate-making purposes.</font> The Company is subject to the risks associated with the geographic concentration of its businesses and current lack of interconnections that could result in service interruptions at the electric utilities or higher default rates on loans held by ASB.  The business of HECO and its electric utility subsidiaries is concentrated on the individual islands they serve in the State of Hawaii. Their operations are more vulnerable to service interruptions than are many U.S. mainland utilities because none of the systems of HECO and its subsidiaries are interconnected with the systems on the other islands they serve. Because of this lack of interconnections, it is necessary to maintain higher generation reserve margins than are typical for U.S. mainland utilities to help ensure reliable service. Service interruptions, including in particular extended interruptions that could result from a natural disaster or terrorist activity, could adversely impact the KWH sales of some or all of the electric utility subsidiaries. For example, in December 2008, an island-wide outage (likely the result of a severe lightning storm) occurred on the island of Oahu that resulted in a loss of electric service to HECO customers ranging from approximately 7 to 20 hours. Substantially all of ASBs consumer loan customers are Hawaii residents. A significant portion of the commercial loan customers are located in Hawaii. While a majority of customers are on Oahu, ASB also has customers on the neighbor islands (whose economies have been weaker than Oahu during the recent economic downturn). Substantially all of the real estate underlying ASBs residential and commercial real estate loans are located in Hawaii. These assets may be subject to a greater risk of default than other comparable assets held by financial institutions with other geographic concentrations in the event of adverse economic, political or business developments or natural disasters affecting Hawaii and the ability of ASBs customers to make payments of principal and interest on their loans. 29Table of Contents Increasing competition and technological advances could cause HEIs businesses to lose customers or render their operations obsolete.  The banking industry in Hawaii, and certain aspects of the electric utility industry, are competitive. The success of HEIs subsidiaries in meeting competition will continue to have a direct impact on HEIs consolidated financial performance. For example: ·                  ASB, one of the largest financial institutions in the state, is in direct competition for deposits and loans not only with two larger institutions that have substantial capital, technology and marketing resources, but also with smaller Hawaii institutions and other U.S. institutions, including credit unions, mutual funds, mortgage brokers, finance companies and investment banking firms. Larger financial institutions may have greater access to capital at lower costs, which could impair ASBs ability to compete effectively. Significant advances in technology could render the operations of ASB less competitive or obsolete.·                  HECO and its subsidiaries face competition from IPPs and customer self-generation, with or without cogeneration. The PUC issued a decision in its investigative proceeding on competitive bidding as a mechanism for acquiring or building new electric generating capacity. With the exception of certain identified projects, the utilities are now required to use competitive bidding to acquire a future generation resource unless the PUC finds competitive bidding to be unsuitable. The PUC also issued a decision in its DG investigative proceeding, in which it set policies for DG interconnection agreements and standby rates, and established conditions under which electric utilities can provide DG services on customer-owned sites as a regulated service. The electric utilities cannot predict the ultimate effect of the PUCs decisions in the competitive bidding and DG proceedings, the impact they will have on competition from IPPs and customer self-generation, or the rate at which technological developments facilitating non-utility generation of electricity will occur.·                  New technological developments, such as the commercial development of fuel cells, may render the operations of HEIs electric utility subsidiaries less competitive or outdated. HEIs businesses could suffer losses that are uninsured due to a lack of affordable insurance coverage, unavailability of insurance coverage or limitations on the insurance coverage the Company does have.  In the ordinary course of business, HEI and its subsidiaries purchase insurance coverages (e.g., property and liability coverages) to protect against loss of, or damage to, their properties and against claims made by third parties and employees for property damage or personal injuries. However, the protection provided by such insurance is limited in significant respects and, in some instances, there is no coverage. Certain of the insurance has substantial deductibles or has limits on the maximum amounts that may be recovered. For example, the electric utilities overhead and underground transmission and distribution systems (with the exception of substation buildings and contents) have a replacement value roughly estimated at $5 billion and are not insured against loss or damage because the amount of transmission and distribution system insurance available is limited and the premiums are cost prohibitive. Similarly, the electric utilities have no business interruption insurance as the premiums for such insurance would be cost prohibitive, particularly since the utilities are not interconnected to other systems. If a hurricane or other uninsured catastrophic natural disaster were to occur, and if the PUC were not to allow the affected electric utilities to recover from ratepayers restoration costs and revenues lost from business interruption, the lost revenues and repair expenses could result in a significant decrease in HEIs consolidated net income or in significant net losses for the affected periods. ASB generally does not obtain credit enhancements, such as mortgagor bankruptcy insurance, but does require standard hazard and hurricane insurance and may require flood insurance for certain properties. ASB is subject to the risks of borrower defaults and bankruptcies, special hazard losses not covered by the required insurance and the insurance companys inability to pay claims on existing policies. Increased federal and state environmental regulation will require an increasing commitment of resources and funds and could result in construction delays or penalties and fines for non-compliance. HEI and its subsidiaries are subject to federal and state environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety, which regulate the operation of existing facilities, the construction and operation of new facilities and the proper cleanup and disposal of hazardous 30Table of Contents waste and toxic substances. Compliance with these legal requirements requires HEIs utility subsidiaries to commit significant resources and funds toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment and payment of emission fees. These laws and regulations, among other things, require that certain environmental permits be obtained in order to construct or operate certain facilities, and obtaining such permits can entail significant expense and cause substantial construction delays. Also, these laws and regulations may be amended from time to time, including amendments that increase the burden and expense of compliance. For example, emission and/or discharge limits may be tightened, more extensive permitting requirements may be imposed and additional substances may become regulated. In addition, significant regulatory uncertainty exists regarding the impact of federal or state greenhouse gas emission limits and reductions. If HEI or its subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond their control, that failure may result in civil or criminal penalties and fines. At the present time, HECO is a named party in an ongoing environmental matter that includes an investigation to determine the nature and extent of actual or potential release of hazardous substances, oil, pollutants or contaminants at or near Honolulu Harbor and their remediation where applicable. Management cannot predict the ultimate cost or outcome of that investigation and the accompanying remedial efforts. Adverse tax rulings or developments could result in significant increases in tax payments and/or expense.  Governmental taxing authorities could challenge a tax return position taken by HEI or its subsidiaries and, if the taxing authorities prevail, HEIs consolidated tax payments and/or expense, including applicable penalties and interest, could increase significantly. The Company could be subject to the risk of uninsured losses in excess of its accruals for litigation matters.  HEI and its subsidiaries are involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of their businesses, most of which is covered by insurance (subject to policy limits and deductibles). However, other litigation may arise that is not routine or involves claims that may not be covered by insurance. Because of the uncertainties associated with litigation, there is a risk that litigation against HEI or its subsidiaries, even if vigorously defended, could result in costs of defense and judgment or settlement amounts not covered by insurance and in excess of reserves established in HEIs consolidated financial statements. Changes in accounting principles and estimates could affect the reported amounts of the Companys assets and liabilities or revenues and expenses.  HEIs consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Changes in these principles, or changes in the Companys application of existing accounting principles, could materially affect HEIs or the electric utilities consolidated financial position and/or results of operations. Further, in preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the amounts reported for investment and mortgage-related securities; property, plant and equipment; pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; contingencies and litigation; income taxes; regulatory assets and liabilities; electric utility revenues; and allowance for loan losses. HECO and its subsidiaries financial statements reflect assets and costs based on cost-based rate-making regulations. Continued accounting in this manner requires that certain criteria relating to the recoverability of such costs through rates be met. If events or circumstances should change so that the criteria are no longer satisfied, the electric utilities regulatory assets (amounting to $478 million as of December 31, 2010) may need to be charged to expense, which could result in significant reductions in the electric utilities net income, and the electric utilities regulatory liabilities (amounting to $297 million as of December 31, 2010) may need to be refunded to ratepayers immediately. Changes in accounting principles can also impact HEIs consolidated financial statements. For example, if management determines that a PPA requires the consolidation of the IPP in HECOs consolidated financial statements, the consolidation could have a material effect on HECOs consolidated financial statements, including the recognition of a significant amount of assets and liabilities and, if such a consolidated IPP were operating at a loss and had insufficient equity, the potential recognition of such losses. Also, if management 31Table of Contents determines that a PPA requires the classification of the agreement as a capital lease, a material effect on HEIs consolidated balance sheet may result, including the recognition of significant capital assets and lease obligations. Electric Utility Risks. Actions of the PUC are outside the control of the electric utility subsidiaries and could result in inadequate or untimely rate relief, in rate reductions or refunds or in unanticipated delays, expenses or writedowns in connection with the construction of new projects.  The rates the electric utilities are allowed to charge for their services and the timeliness of permitted rate increases are among the most important items influencing the electric utilities financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The PUC has broad discretion over the rates that the electric utilities charge their customers. The electric utilities currently have rate cases pending before the PUC. Further, the trend of increased O&M expenses, which management expects will continue, increased plant-in-service and other factors are likely to result in the electric utilities continuing to seek rate relief frequently. Also, as part of the decoupling mechanism that the electric utilities will be implementing, each of the electric utilities will alternately file a rate case once every three years. Any adverse decision by the PUC concerning the level or method of determining electric utility rates, the items and amounts that may be included in rate base, the returns on equity or rate base found to be reasonable, the potential consequences of exceeding or not meeting such returns, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding, could have a material adverse effect on HECOs consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. To improve the timing and certainty of the recovery of their costs, the electric utilities have proposed and received approval of various cost recovery mechanisms including an ECAC, and more recently a decoupling mechanism, a purchased power adjustment clause, and a renewable energy infrastructure program surcharge. The electric utilities could be required to refund to their customers, with interest, revenues that have been or may be received under interim rate orders in their rate case proceedings, IRP cost recovery dockets and other proceedings, if and to the extent they exceed the amounts allowed in final orders. As of December 31, 2010, the electric utilities had recognized an aggregate of $4 million of such revenues with respect to interim orders. Many public utility projects require PUC approval and various permits (e.g., environmental and land use permits) from other governmental agencies. Difficulties in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, the necessary approvals or permits, or any adverse decision or policy made or adopted, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision, by an agency with respect to such approvals and permits, can result in significantly increased project costs or even cancellation of projects. For example, two major capital improvement projects  HECOs East Oahu Transmission Project and the expansion of HELCOs Keahole generating plant  encountered substantial opposition and consequent delay and increased cost. In the event a project does not proceed, or if the PUC disallows cost recovery for all or part of the project, project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could result in significant reductions in HECOs consolidated net income. Energy cost adjustment clauses. The rate schedules of each of HEIs electric utilities include ECACs under which electric rates charged to customers are automatically adjusted for changes in the weighted-average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power, and the relative amounts of company-generated power and purchased power. The Energy Agreement confirms the intent of the parties that the existing ECACs will continue, but subject to periodic review by the PUC. The Energy Agreement also provides that as part of the review, the PUC may examine whether there are renewable energy projects from which the utilities should have, but did not, purchase energy or whether alternative fuel purchase strategies were appropriately used or not used. In the recent rate cases, the PUC has allowed the current ECAC to continue. However, a change in, or the elimination of, the ECAC could have a material adverse affect on the electric utilities. Electric utility operations are significantly influenced by weather conditions.  The electric utilities results of operations can be affected by changes in the weather. Weather conditions, particularly temperature and humidity, directly influence the demand for electricity. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis and lightning storms, which may become more severe or frequent as a 32Table of Contents result of global warming, can cause outages and property damage and require the utilities to incur significant additional expenses that may not be recoverable. Electric utility operations depend heavily on third-party suppliers of fuel and purchased power.  The electric utilities rely on fuel oil suppliers and shippers and IPPs to deliver fuel oil and power, respectively, in accordance with contractual agreements. Approximately 76% of the net energy generated or purchased by the electric utilities in 2010 was generated from the burning of fossil fuel oil, and purchases of power by the electric utilities provided about 40% of their total net energy generated and purchased for the same period. Failure or delay by oil suppliers and shippers to provide fuel pursuant to existing contracts, or failure by a major IPP to deliver the firm capacity anticipated in its PPA, could disrupt the ability of the electric utilities to deliver electricity and require the electric utilities to incur additional expenses to meet the needs of their customers that may not be recoverable. In addition, as these contractual agreements end, the electric utilities may not be able to purchase fuel and power on terms equivalent to the current contractual agreements. Further, as the use of biofuels in generating units increases, the same risks will exist with suppliers of biofuels. Electric utility generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated and/or increased operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs.  Operation of electric generating facilities involves certain risks which can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels. Included among these risks are facility shutdowns or power interruptions due to insufficient generation or a breakdown or failure of equipment or processes or interruptions in fuel supply, inability to negotiate satisfactory collective bargaining agreements when existing agreements expire or other labor disputes, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements, disruptions in delivery of electricity, operator error and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, fires, explosions, floods or other similar occurrences affecting the electric utilities generating facilities or transmission and distribution systems. Global warming may result in rising sea levels, which could pose a threat to facilities of the utilities, particularly those located in coastal or other low-lying areas. The utilities have taken a number of steps to mitigate the risk of outages, including securing additional purchased power, adding new utility generation, adding distributed generation and encouraging energy conservation. The costs of supplying energy to meet high demand and maintenance costs required to sustain high availability of aging generation units have been increasing and the trend of cost increases is not likely to ease, putting pressure on earnings to the extent timely rate relief is not achieved.</p> The electric utilities may be adversely affected by new legislation.  Congress and the Hawaii Legislature periodically consider legislation that could have positive or negative effects on the electric utilities and their customers. In addition to the ECAC provisions of Act 162 discussed above, the Hawaii Legislature adopted a number of measures that may affect the electric utilities, as described below. Renewable Portfolio Standards law.  In 2009, Hawaiis Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) law was amended to require electric utilities to meet an RPS of 10%, 15%, 25% and 40% by December 31, 2010, 2015, 2020 and 2030, respectively. Energy savings resulting from energy efficiency programs will not count toward the RPS after 2014. The utilities are committed to achieving these goals and expect to meet the 2010 RPS; however, due to the exclusion of energy savings in calculating RPS after 2014 and risks such as potential delays in IPPs being able to deliver contracted renewable energy, it is possible the electric utilities may not attain the required renewable percentages in the future, and management cannot predict the future consequences of failure to do so (including potential penalties to be assessed by the PUC). On December 19, 2008, the PUC approved a penalty of $20 for every MWh that an electric utility is deficient under Hawaiis RPS law. The PUC noted, however, that this penalty may be reduced, in the PUCs discretion, due to events or circumstances that are outside an electric utilitys reasonable control, to the extent the event or circumstance could not be reasonably foreseen and ameliorated, as described in the RPS law and in an RPS framework. In addition, the PUC ordered that the utilities will be prohibited from recovering any RPS penalty costs through rates. Net energy metering.  Hawaii has a net energy metering law, which requires that electric utilities offer net energy metering to eligible customer generators (i.e., a customer generator may be a net user or supplier 33Table of Contents of energy and will make payment to or receive credit from the electric utility accordingly). In the Energy Agreement, the parties agreed to seek to remove system-wide caps on net energy metering. Instead, they planned to seek to limit DG interconnections on a per-circuit basis and eventually to replace net energy metering with an appropriate feed-in tariff. The PUC recently indicated they plan to retain NEM even with feed-in tariffs. In January 2011, the PUC approved the replacement of the system-wide net metering caps with a 15% per circuit distribution threshold for DG penetration. Renewable energy.  In 2007, a measure was passed by the Hawaii legislature stating that the PUC may consider the need for increased renewable energy in rendering decisions on utility matters. Due to this measure, it is possible that, if energy from a renewable source were more expensive than energy from fossil fuel, the PUC may still approve the purchase of energy from the renewable source. In 2008, a law was enacted to promote and encourage the use of solar thermal energy. This measure will require the installation of solar thermal water heaters in residences constructed after January 1, 2010, but allow for limited variances in cases where installation of solar water heating is deemed inappropriate. Also in 2008, a law was enacted that is intended to facilitate the permitting of larger (200 MW or greater) renewable energy projects. The Energy Agreement includes several undertakings by the utilities to integrate solar energy into their electric grid. In 2009, a Hawaii law (Act 185) was enacted authorizing preferential rates to agricultural energy producers selling electricity to utilities. This will help support the long-term development of locally grown biofuel crops, cultivating potential local renewable fuel sources for the utilities. In addition, pursuant to Act 50 (also adopted in 2009), avoided cost is no longer the primary consideration in determining a just and reasonable rate for non-fossil fuel generated electricity. This will allow the utilities to negotiate purchased power prices for renewable energy that have the potential to be more stable and less costly than current pricing tied to avoided cost. Global climate change and greenhouse gas emissions reduction.  National and international concern about climate change and the contribution of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to global warming have led to action by the state of Hawaii and federal legislative and regulatory proposals to reduce GHG emissions. In July 2007, Act 234, which requires a statewide reduction of GHG emissions by January 1, 2020 to levels at or below the statewide GHG emission levels in 1990, became law in Hawaii. In recent years, several approaches to GHG emission reduction (including cap and trade) have been either introduced or discussed in Congress; however, no legislation has yet been enacted. In response to the 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, which ruled that the EPA has the authority to regulate GHG emissions from motor vehicles under the CAA, the EPA has accelerated rulemaking addressing GHG emissions from both mobile and stationary sources. On September 22, 2009, the EPA issued the Final Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule. The rule, which applies to HECO, HELCO and MECO, requires that sources above certain threshold levels monitor GHG emissions beginning in 2010. The first reports on these emissions, which the Company is currently preparing, are due to the EPA by March 31, 2011. On June 3, 2010, the EPAs final Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Tailoring Rule (GHG Tailoring Rule) was published. It creates a new emissions threshold for GHG emissions from new and existing facilities. The utilities are evaluating the impact of the GHG Tailoring Rule and a three-year permit deferral for biomass-fired and other biogenic sources on the utilities operations. Biofuels.  In 2007, a Hawaii law was enacted with the stated purpose of encouraging further production and use of biofuels in Hawaii. It established that biofuel processing facilities in Hawaii are a permitted use in designated agricultural districts and established a program with the Hawaii Department of Agriculture to encourage the production in Hawaii of energy feedstock (i.e., raw materials for biofuels). In 2008, a law was enacted that encourages the development of biofuels by authorizing the Hawaii Board of Land and Natural Resources to lease public lands to growers or producers of plant and animal material used for the production of biofuels. At this time, it is not possible to predict with certainty the impact on the utilities of the foregoing legislation or legislation that now is, or may in the future be, proposed. 34Table of Contents The electric utilities may be subject to increased operational challenges and their results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely impacted in meeting the commitments and objectives of the HCEI Energy Agreement.  On October 20, 2008, the Governor of the State of Hawaii, the State of Hawaii Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism, the Division of Consumer Advocacy of the State of Hawaii Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs and the electric utilities (collectively, the parties), signed an Energy Agreement setting forth the goals and objectives of the HCEI and the related commitments of the parties. The Energy Agreement requires the parties to pursue a wide range of actions with the purpose of decreasing the State of Hawaiis dependence on imported fossil fuels through substantial increases in the use of renewable energy and implementation of new programs intended to secure greater energy efficiency and conservation. The far-reaching nature of the Energy Agreement, including the extent of renewable energy commitments and the implementation of a new regulatory model which decouples revenues from sales, present new increased risks to the Company. Among such risks are: (1) the dependence on third party suppliers of renewable purchased energy, which if the utilities are unsuccessful in negotiating purchased power agreements with such IPPs or if a major IPP fails to deliver the anticipated capacity in its purchased power agreement, could impact the utilities achievement of its commitments under the Energy Agreement and/or the utilities ability to deliver reliable service; (2) delays in acquiring or unavailability of non-fossil fuel supplies for renewable generation; (3) the impact of intermittent power to the electrical grid and reliability of service if appropriate supporting infrastructure is not installed or does not operate effectively; (4) the likelihood that the utilities may need to make substantial investments in related infrastructure, which could result in increased borrowings and, therefore, materially impact the financial condition and cash flows of the utilities; and (5) the commitment to support a variety of initiatives, which, if approved by the PUC, may have a material impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the utilities depending on their design and implementation. Programs include, but are not limited to, decoupling revenues from sales; implementing feed-in tariffs to encourage development of renewable energy; removing the system-wide caps on net energy metering (but studying distributed generation interconnections on a per-circuit basis); and developing an Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard. Management cannot predict the ultimate impact or outcome of the implementation of these or other HCEI programs on the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the electric utilities. Bank Risks. Fluctuations in interest rates could result in lower net interest income, impair ASBs ability to originate new loans or impair the ability of ASBs adjustable-rate borrowers to make increased payments.  Interest rate risk is a significant risk of ASBs operations. ASBs net interest income consists primarily of interest income received on fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, mortgage-related securities and investments and interest expense consisting primarily of interest paid on deposits and other borrowings. Interest rate risk arises when earning assets mature or when their interest rates change in a time frame different from that of the costing liabilities. Changes in market interest rates, including changes in the relationship between short-term and long-term market interest rates or between different interest rate indices, can impact ASBs net interest margin. Although ASB pursues an asset-liability management strategy designed to mitigate its risk from changes in market interest rates, unfavorable movements in interest rates could result in lower net interest income. Residential 1-4 family fixed-rate mortgage loans comprised about 54% of ASBs loan portfolio as of December 31, 2010 and do not re-price with movements in interest rates. ASB continues to face a challenging interest rate environment. The weak global, national and local economic environments have resulted in a persistent, low level of interest rates, weak loan demand, and excess liquidity in the financial system. In addition, expectations are increasing that interest rates will rise rapidly once there are strong signs that the economic recovery is taking hold. ASBs decision to sell substantially all of its fixed rate mortgage production throughout 2009 and the first nine months of 2010 and challenges in finding investments with adequate risk-adjusted returns resulted in declining loan balances and an increase in ASBs liquidity position, which had a negative impact on ASBs asset yields and net interest margin. The potential for compression of ASBs margin when interest rates rise is an ongoing concern. Increases in market interest rates could have an adverse impact on ASBs cost of funds. Higher market interest rates could lead to higher interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Significant increases in 35Table of Contents market interest rates, or the perception that an increase may occur, could adversely affect ASBs ability to originate new loans and grow. An increase in market interest rates, especially a sudden increase, could also adversely affect the ability of ASBs adjustable-rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations. If this occurred, it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets and charge-offs. Conversely, a decrease in interest rates or a mismatching of maturities of interest sensitive financial instruments could result in an acceleration in the prepayment of loans and mortgage-related securities and impact ASBs ability to reinvest its liquidity in similar yielding assets. Historically low interest rates in 2008, 2009 and 2010 resulted in high refinancings, which reduced the level of future interest income. ASBs operations are affected by many disparate factors, some of which are beyond its control, that could result in lower net interest income or decreased demand for its products and services.  ASBs results of operations depend primarily on the level of interest income generated by ASBs earning assets in excess of the interest expense on its costing liabilities and the supply of and demand for its products and services (i.e., loans and deposits). ASBs net income may also be adversely affected by various other factors, such as: ·                  local and other economic and political conditions that could result in declines in employment and real estate values, which in turn could adversely affect the ability of borrowers to make loan payments and the ability of ASB to recover the full amounts owing to it under defaulted loans;·                  the ability of borrowers to obtain insurance and the ability of ASB to place insurance where borrowers fail to do so, particularly in the event of catastrophic damage to collateral securing loans made by ASB;·                  faster than expected loan prepayments that can cause an acceleration of the amortization of premiums on loans and investments and the impairment of mortgage servicing assets of ASB;·                  changes in ASBs loan portfolio credit profiles and asset quality, which may increase or decrease the required level of allowance for loan losses;·                  technological disruptions affecting ASBs operations or financial or operational difficulties experienced by any outside vendor on whom ASB relies to provide key components of its business operations, such as business processing, network access or internet connections;·                  the impact of potential legislative and regulatory changes increasing oversight of, and reporting by, banks in response to the recent financial crisis and federal bailout of financial institutions;·                  legislative changes regulating the assessment of overdraft, interchange and credit card fees, which will have a negative impact on noninterest income;·                  public opinion about ASB and financial institutions in general, which, if negative, could impact the publics trust and confidence in ASB and adversely affect ASBs ability to attract and retain customers and expose ASB to adverse legal and regulatory consequences;·                  increases in operating costs, inflation and other factors, that exceed increases in ASB s net interest, fee and other income; and·                  the ability of ASB to maintain or increase the level of deposits, ASBs lowest costing funds. Banking and related regulations could result in significant restrictions being imposed on ASBs business or in a requirement that HEI divest ASB.  ASB is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the Department of Treasury, the OTS and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and is subject to reserve requirements established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the OTS will be abolished and the OCC will become ASBs primary regulator in July 2011 (unless the date is extended). In addition, the Federal Reserve will be made responsible for regulating ASBs holding company, HEI. The regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies to address not only ASBs compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations, but also capital adequacy, asset quality, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity and various other factors. Under certain circumstances, including any determination that ASBs relationship with HEI results in an unsafe and unsound banking practice, these regulatory authorities have the authority to restrict the ability of ASB to transfer assets and to make distributions to its shareholders (including payment of dividends to HEI), or they could seek to require HEI to sever its relationship with or divest its ownership of ASB. Payment by ASB of 36Table of Contents dividends to HEI may also be restricted by the OTS under its prompt corrective action regulations or its capital distribution regulations if ASBs capital position deteriorates. In order to maintain its status as a QTL, ASB is required to maintain at least 65% of its assets in qualified thrift investments. Savings associations that fail to maintain QTL status are subject to various penalties, including limitations on their activities. In ASBs case, the activities of HEI and HEIs other subsidiaries would also be subject to restrictions, and a failure or inability to comply with those restrictions could effectively result in the required divestiture of ASB. There is also proposed federal legislation that could result in a required divestiture of ASB. In the event of a required divestiture, federal law substantially limits the types of entities that could potentially acquire ASB. Recent legislative and regulatory initiatives could have an adverse affect on ASBs business.  The Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July 2010, is expected to have a substantial impact on the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes a framework through which regulatory reform will be written and changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies could affect ASB in substantial and unpredictable ways. A major component of the Dodd-Frank Act is the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that will have the responsibility for setting and enforcing clear, consistent rules relating to consumer financial products and services and will have the authority to prohibit practices it finds to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. Compliance with any such directives could have adverse effects on ASBs revenues or operating costs. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on ASBs business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A large percentage of ASBs loans and securities are collateralized by real estate, and adverse changes in the real estate market and/or general economic conditions may result in loan losses and adversely affect the Companys profitability.  As of December 31, 2010 approximately 82% of ASBs loan portfolio was comprised of loans primarily collateralized by real estate, most of which was concentrated in the State of Hawaii. ASBs financial results may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions, either nationally or in the state of Hawaii, including decreases in real estate values, adverse employment conditions, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal and state government and other significant external events. A deterioration of the economic environment in Hawaii, including a material decline in the real estate market, further declines in home resales, or a material external shock, may significantly impair the value of ASBs collateral and ASBs ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. In the event of a default, amounts received upon sale of the collateral may be insufficient to recover outstanding principal and interest. Adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans. In addition, if poor economic conditions result in decreased demand for real estate loans, ASBs profits may decrease if alternative investments earn less income than real estate loans. ASBs strategy to expand its commercial and commercial real estate lending activities may result in higher service costs and greater credit risk than residential lending activities due to the unique characteristics of these markets.  ASB has been aggressively pursuing a strategy that includes expanding its commercial and commercial real estate lines of business. These types of loans generally entail higher underwriting and other service costs and present greater credit risks than traditional residential mortgages. Generally, both commercial and commercial real estate loans have shorter terms to maturity and earn higher spreads than residential mortgage loans. Only the assets of the business typically secure commercial loans. In such cases, upon default, any collateral repossessed may not be sufficient to repay the outstanding loan balance. In addition, loan collections are dependent on the borrowers continuing financial stability and, thus, are more likely to be affected by current economic conditions and adverse business developments. Commercial real estate properties tend to be unique and are more difficult to value than residential real estate properties. Commercial real estate loans may not be fully amortizing, meaning that they may have a significant principal balance or balloon payment due at maturity. In addition, commercial real estate properties, particularly industrial and warehouse properties, are generally subject to relatively greater environmental risks than noncommercial properties and to the corresponding burdens and costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Also, there may be costs and delays involved in enforcing rights of a property owner against tenants in default under the terms of leases with respect to commercial properties. For 37Table of Contents example, a tenant may seek the protection of bankruptcy laws, which could result in termination of the tenants lease. In addition to the inherent risks of commercial and commercial real estate lending described above, the expansion of these new lines of business present execution risks, including the ability of ASB to attract personnel experienced in underwriting such loans and the ability of ASB to appropriately evaluate credit risk associated with such loans in determining the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses. "
