3,D,DOMINION ENERGY INC,2024-02-23,"Risk Factors
The Companies’ businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyond their control. A number of these factors have been identified below. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement or projection contained in this report, see Forward-Looking Statements in Item 7. MD&A. As discussed in Future Issues in Item 7. MD&A, Dominion Energy has commenced a comprehensive business review.  The outcomes of the business review and the implementation of the resulting recommendations may be subject to various risks and uncertainties (some of which may include the risks and uncertainties discussed below or other risks and uncertainties that cannot yet be determined) that could have a material impact on the Companies’ future results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition.Regulatory, Legislative and Legal Risks The rates of the Companies’ principal electric transmission, distribution and generation operations and gas distribution operations are subject to regulatory review.  Revenue provided by the Companies’ electric transmission, distribution and generation operations and by gas distribution operations is based primarily on rates approved by state and federal regulatory agencies. The profitability of the Companies’ businesses is dependent on their ability, through the rates that they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on their capital investment. At the federal level, the Companies’ wholesale rates for electric transmission service are regulated by FERC. Rates for electric transmission services are updated annually according to a FERC-approved formula rate mechanism, and may be subject to additional prospective adjustments and retroactive corrections. A failure by the Companies to support these rates could result in rate decreases from current rate levels, which could adversely affect the Companies’ results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. At the state level, Virginia Power’s retail base rates, terms and conditions for generation and distribution services to customers in Virginia are reviewed by the Virginia Commission in a proceeding that involves the determination of Virginia Power’s actual earned ROE during a historic test period, and the determination of Virginia Power’s authorized ROE prospectively. The GTSA reinstated base rate reviews commencing with the 2021 Triennial Review. Legislation enacted in Virginia in April 2023 reset the frequency of base rate reviews to a biennial period commencing with the 2023 Biennial Review. Under certain circumstances described in the Regulation Act, Virginia Power may be required to refund a portion of its earnings to customers through a refund process and to reduce its rates. Virginia Power makes assessments throughout the review period and will record a regulatory liability for refunds to customers in any period it is determined probable, which could be material to the Companies’ results of operations in the period recognized and to cash flows on completion of any biennial review. In states other than Virginia, the Companies’ retail electric base rates for generation and distribution services to customers are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to the statutes, rules and procedures of such states. Dominion Energy’s rates for gas distribution to retail customers are similarly regulated at the state level. If retail electric or gas earnings exceed the returns established by state utility commissions, retail electric rates or gas rates may be subject to review and possible reduction, which may decrease the Companies’ future earnings. Additionally, if any state utility commission does not allow recovery through base rates, on a timely basis, of costs incurred in providing service, the Company’s future earnings could be negatively impacted. Under certain circumstances, state utility regulators may impose a moratorium on increases to retail base rates for a specified period of time, which could delay recovery of costs incurred in providing service. Additionally, governmental officials, stakeholders and advocacy groups may challenge any of the regulatory reviews or proceedings referred to above. Such challenges may lengthen the time, complexity and costs associated with such regulatory reviews or proceedings. The Companies’ generation business may be negatively affected by possible FERC actions that could change market design in the wholesale markets or affect pricing rules or revenue calculations in the RTO markets.  The Companies’ generation stations operating in RTO markets sell capacity, energy and ancillary services into wholesale electricity markets regulated by FERC. The wholesale markets allow these generation stations to take advantage of market price opportunities, but also expose them to market risk. Properly functioning competitive wholesale markets depend upon FERC’s continuation of clearly identified market rules. From time to time FERC may investigate and authorize RTOs to make changes in market design. FERC also periodically reviews the Companies’ authority to sell at market-based rates. Material changes by FERC to the design of the wholesale markets or its interpretation of market rules, the Companies’ authority to sell power at market-based rates, or changes to pricing rules or rules involving revenue calculations, could adversely impact the future results of the Companies’ generation business. For example, in September 2021, FERC issued a final order that allows distributed energy resource aggregators to compete in regional wholesale electric markets. This rule followed a previous order which mandated that distributed energy resources be allowed to participate in wholesale markets.  RTOs, including PJM, are responsible for issuing implementation rules to FERC for approval. In addition,  36 changes to the interpretation and application of FERC’s market manipulation rules may occur from time to time. A failure to comply with these market manipulation rules could lead to civil and criminal penalties. The Companies are subject to complex governmental regulation, including tax regulation, that could adversely affect their results of operations and subject the Companies to monetary penalties.  The Companies’ operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations and require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies. Such laws and regulations govern the terms and conditions of the services the Companies offer, relationships with affiliates, protection of critical electric infrastructure assets and pipeline safety, among other matters. The Companies are also subject to legislation and associated regulation governing taxation at the federal, state and local level. They must also comply with environmental legislation and associated regulations. Management believes that the necessary approvals have been obtained for existing operations and that the businesses are conducted in accordance with applicable laws. The Companies’ businesses are subject to regulatory regimes which could result in substantial monetary penalties if either of the Companies is found not to be in compliance, including mandatory reliability standards and interaction in the wholesale markets. New laws or regulations, the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations, changes in enforcement practices of regulators, or penalties imposed for non-compliance with existing laws or regulations may result in substantial additional expense. Recent legislative and regulatory changes that are impacting the Companies include legislation enacted in Virginia in April 2023, the IRA, the VCEA, the 2017 Tax Reform Act and tariffs imposed on imported solar panels by the U.S. government in 2018. The Companies have been and may continue to be or become subject to legal proceedings and governmental investigations and examinations.  The Companies may from time to time be subject to various legal proceedings and governmental investigations and examinations.  For example, Dominion Energy, following the SCANA Combination, was subject to numerous federal and state legal proceedings and governmental investigations relating to the decision of SCANA and DESC to abandon construction at the NND Project. Dominion Energy spent substantial amounts of time and money defending these lawsuits and proceedings and on related investigations. In addition, juries have demonstrated a willingness to grant large awards in certain cases, including personal injury claims. Accordingly, actual costs incurred may differ materially from insured or reserved amounts and may not be recoverable, in whole or in part, by insurance or in rates from customers. The outcome of these or future legal proceedings, investigations and examinations, including settlements, may adversely affect the Companies’ financial condition or results of operation.Environmental Risks Compliance with federal and/or state requirements imposing limitations on GHG emissions or efficiency improvements, as well as Dominion Energy’s commitment to achieve net zero carbon and methane emissions by 2050, may result in significant compliance costs, could result in certain of the Companies’ existing electric generation units being uneconomical to maintain or operate and may depend upon technological advancements which may be beyond the Companies’ control.  Virginia has adopted the VCEA which establishes renewable energy and CO2 reduction targets for Virginia Power’s generation fleet and grid operations, including the requirement that 100% of Virginia Power’s electricity come from zero-carbon generation by the end of 2045.  The legislation mandates the development of 16.1 GW of solar or onshore wind capacity by the end of 2035, which includes specific requirements for utility-scale solar of 3.0 GW by the end of 2024, up to 15.0 GW by the end of 2035 and 1.1 GW of small-scale solar by the end of 2035. The legislation also deems 5.2 GW of offshore wind capacity before 2035 and 2.7 GW of energy storage by the end of 2035 to be in the public interest.  The VCEA and related legislation also authorizes Virginia to participate in a program consistent with RGGI, requiring the purchase of carbon credits to offset emissions from Virginia Power’s generating fleet within the state.  In January 2022, the Governor of Virginia issued an executive order which put directives in place to start the withdrawal of Virginia from RGGI. In December 2023, the withdrawal took effect. Cost recovery for these initiatives will require approval by the Virginia Commission which may be denied or materially altered to the detriment of the Companies. For example, the Companies recorded charges in 2022 associated with the Virginia Commission’s approval in June 2022 of Virginia Power’s petition that RGGI compliance costs incurred and unrecovered through July 2022 be recovered through existing base rates in effect during the period incurred. In addition, permitting and other project execution challenges may hinder Virginia Power’s ability to meet the requirements of the VCEA. The Companies could face similar risks if there is further legislation at the federal and/or state level mandating additional limitations on GHG emissions or requiring additional efficiency improvements. In February 2020, Dominion Energy announced its commitment to achieve net zero carbon and methane Scope 1 emissions by 2050. In February 2022, Dominion Energy expanded this commitment to cover Scope 2 emissions and material categories of Scope 3 emissions. To meet this commitment, the Companies expect to construct new electric generation facilities, including renewable facilities such as wind and solar, and to seek the extension of operating licenses for the Companies’ nuclear generation facilities. The Companies also need to depend on technological improvements not currently in commercial development. Additionally, actions taken in furtherance of Dominion Energy’s net zero commitment may impact existing generation facilities, including as a result of fuel switching and/or the retirement of high-emitting generation facilities and their potential replacement with lower-emitting generation facilities. Further, the ability to realize this commitment will require the Companies to be able to obtain significant financing. These efforts will require approvals from various regulatory bodies for the siting and construction of such new facilities and a determination  37 by the applicable state commissions that costs related to the construction are prudent. Given these and other uncertainties associated with the implementation of Dominion Energy’s net zero commitment, the Companies cannot estimate the aggregate effect of future actions taken in furtherance of this commitment on their results of operations or financial condition or on their customers. However, such actions could render additional existing generation facilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect the Companies’ results of operations, financial performance or liquidity. There are also potential impacts on Dominion Energy’s natural gas business from its net zero emissions commitment as well as federal or state GHG regulations which may require further GHG emission reductions from the natural gas sector which, in addition to resulting in increased costs, could affect demand for natural gas. Additionally, GHG requirements could result in increased demand for energy conservation and renewable products, which could impact the natural gas business. Dominion Energy’s renewable natural gas projects, expected to be a key component of Dominion Energy’s environmental strategy, require approvals from various regulatory bodies for the siting and construction of such facilities. The Companies’ operations and construction activities are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations which impose significant compliance costs on the Companies.  The Companies’ operations and construction activities are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources, and health and safety. Compliance with these legal requirements requires the Companies to commit significant capital toward permitting, emission fees, environmental monitoring, installation and operation of environmental control equipment and purchase of allowances and/or offsets. Additionally, the Companies could be responsible for expenses relating to remediation and containment obligations, including at sites where they have been identified by a regulatory agency as a potentially responsible party. Expenditures relating to environmental compliance have been significant in the past, and the Companies expect that they will remain significant in the future. Certain facilities have become uneconomical to operate and have been shut down, converted to new fuel types or sold. These types of events could occur again in the future. The Companies expect that existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and/or new laws may be adopted including regulation of GHG emissions which could have an impact on the Companies’ business (risks relating to regulation of GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units are discussed in more detail above and below). In addition, further regulation of air quality and GHG emissions under the CAA may be imposed on the natural gas sector. The Companies are also subject to federal water and waste regulations, including regulations concerning cooling water intake structures, coal combustion by-product handling and disposal practices, wastewater discharges from steam electric generating stations, management and disposal of hydraulic fracturing fluids and the potential further regulation of polychlorinated biphenyls. Compliance costs cannot be estimated with certainty due to the inability to predict the requirements and timing of implementation of any new environmental rules or regulations. Other factors which affect the ability to predict future environmental expenditures with certainty include the difficulty in estimating clean-up costs and quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liabilities on all responsible parties. However, such expenditures, if material, could make the Companies’ facilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect the Companies’ results of operations, financial performance or liquidity. The Companies are subject to risks associated with the disposal and storage of coal ash.  The Companies historically produced and continue to produce coal ash, or CCRs, as a by-product of their coal-fired generation operations. The ash is stored and managed in impoundments (ash ponds) and landfills located at 11 different facilities, eight of which are at Virginia Power. The EPA has issued regulations concerning the management and storage of CCRs, which Virginia has adopted. These CCR regulations require the Companies to make additional capital expenditures and increase operating and maintenance expenses. In addition, the Companies will incur expenses and other costs associated with closing, corrective action and ongoing monitoring of certain ash ponds and landfills. The Companies also may face litigation concerning their coal ash facilities. Further, while the Companies operate their ash ponds and landfills in compliance with applicable state safety regulations, a release of coal ash with a significant environmental impact could result in remediation costs, civil and/or criminal penalties, claims, litigation, increased regulation and compliance costs, and reputational damage, and could impact the financial condition of the Companies. Construction Risks The development and construction of the CVOW Commercial Project involves significant risks. The CVOW Commercial Project is a large-scale, complex project that will take several years to complete. Significant delays or cost increases, or an inability to recover certain project costs, could have an adverse effect on the Companies’ financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.  If the Companies are unable to complete the development and construction of the CVOW Commercial Project or decide in the future to delay or cancel the project, the Companies may not be able to recover all or a portion of their investment in the project and may  38 incur substantial cancellation payments under existing contracts or other substantial costs associated with any such delay or cancellation. The Companies’ ability to complete the CVOW Commercial Project within the currently proposed timeline, or at all, and consistent with current cost estimates is subject to various risks and uncertainties, certain of which are beyond the Companies’ control.  The development and construction of the CVOW Commercial Project is dependent on the Companies’ ability to obtain and maintain various local, state and federal permits, rights of way and other regulatory approvals, including Virginia Commission approval for rider recovery of project costs. In addition, the design and route of the project’s onshore electric transmission, network upgrades and other facilities remain subject to regulatory and PJM review and approval. Changes in the design and route of these onshore facilities, including an increase in amount of undergrounding, would likely increase project costs. Also, the CVOW Commercial Project may become the subject of litigation or other forms of intervention by third parties, including stakeholders or advocacy groups, that may impact the timing and receipt of permits or other regulatory approvals or otherwise delay or increase the cost of the project. The Companies’ ability to recover unforeseen cost increases associated with construction of the CVOW Commercial Project is potentially limited which could negatively impact the Companies’ future financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.  In accordance with the Virginia Commission’s order in December 2022, the Companies are subject to a cost sharing mechanism in which Virginia Power will be eligible to recover 50% of such incremental costs which fall between $10.3 billion and $11.3 billion with no recovery of such incremental costs which fall between $11.3 billion and $13.7 billion.  There is no cost sharing mechanism for any total construction costs in excess of $13.7 billion, the recovery of which would be determined in a future Virginia Commission preceding.  In addition, the order includes enhanced performance reporting provisions for the operation of the CVOW Commercial Project.  To the extent the net annual net capacity factor is below 42%, as determined on a three-year rolling average, Virginia Power is required to provide detailed explanation of the factors contributing to any shortfall to the Virginia Commission which could determine in a future proceeding a remedy for incremental costs incurred associated with any deemed unreasonable or imprudent actions of Virginia Power. Any such action by the Virginia Commission could adversely impact the Companies’ future financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. The Companies’ ability to invest the significant financial resources necessary for the CVOW Commercial Project is dependent on the Companies’ access to the financial markets in a timely and cost-effective manner. A decline in the Companies’ credit worthiness, an unfavorable market reputation of either the Companies or their industry or general market disruptions could adversely impact financing costs and increase the overall cost of the project. The development and construction of the CVOW Commercial Project is also dependent on the ability of certain key suppliers and contractors to timely satisfy their obligations under contracts entered into or expected to be entered into. Given the unique equipment and expertise required for this project, the Companies may not be able to remedy in a timely and cost-effective manner, if at all, any failure by one or more of these suppliers or contractors to timely satisfy their contractual obligations. Certain of the fixed price contracts for major offshore construction and equipment components are denominated in Euros and Danish kroner, including those which contain commodity indexing provisions linked to steel. In May 2022, Virginia Power entered into forward purchase agreements with a notional amount of approximately €3.2 billion. Accordingly, to the extent the instruments do not effectively hedge the Companies’ exposure to these currencies, including by default of the counterparty, adverse fluctuations in the applicable exchange rates would likely adversely affect the cost of the CVOW Commercial Project. Similarly, adverse fluctuations in the price of certain raw materials, including steel, would likely, to the extent not hedged by the Companies, adversely affect the overall costs incurred to develop and construct the project. The development and construction of the CVOW Commercial Project involves the use of evolving turbine technology and will take place in a marine environment, which presents unique challenges and will require the use of a specialized workforce and specialized equipment. In addition, the timely installation of the turbines is dependent on the completion and availability of a Jones Act compliant vessel currently under construction. The timeline for development and construction of the CVOW Commercial Project may also be negatively impacted by severe weather events or marine wildlife, including migration patterns of endangered and protected species, both of which are outside of the control of the Companies and their contractors. In connection with the February 2024 agreement to sell a 50% noncontrolling interest to Stonepeak, certain activities prior to closing require the consent of Stonepeak. Stonepeak’s interests and objectives may differ from those of the Companies and, accordingly, disputes may arise that may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses. The Companies’ infrastructure build and expansion plans often require regulatory approval, including environmental permits, before commencing construction and completing projects. The Companies may not complete the facility construction, pipeline, conversion or other infrastructure projects that they commence, or they may complete projects on materially different terms, costs or timing than initially estimated or anticipated, and they may not be able to achieve the intended benefits of any such project, if completed. A number of large and small scale projects have been announced, including the CVOW  39 Commercial Project, electric transmission lines, pipeline replacements, facility expansions or renewed licensing, conversions and other infrastructure developments or construction. Additional projects may be considered in the future. The Companies compete for projects with companies of varying size and financial capabilities, including some that may have competitive advantages. Commencing construction on announced and future projects may require approvals from applicable state and federal agencies, and such approvals could include mitigation costs which may be material to the Companies. Projects may not be able to be completed on time or in accordance with estimated costs as a result of weather conditions, need for new land and right of ways, delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory and other, including PJM, approvals, delays in obtaining key materials, labor difficulties, difficulties with partners or potential partners, concerns raised during stakeholder engagement, a decline in the credit strength of counterparties or vendors, inflation, or other factors beyond the Companies’ control. For example, Dominion Energy has been involved with projects which have experienced certain delays in obtaining and maintaining permits necessary for construction along with construction delays due to judicial actions which impacted the cost and schedule such as the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project and ultimately led to its cancellation in July 2020. Even if facility construction, pipeline, expansion, electric transmission line, conversion and other infrastructure projects are completed, the total costs of the projects may be higher than anticipated and the performance of the business of the Companies following completion of the projects may not meet expectations.  Start-up and operational issues can arise in connection with the commencement of commercial operations at the Companies’ facilities. Such issues may include failure to meet specific operating parameters, which may require adjustments to meet or amend these operating parameters. Additionally, the Companies may not be able to timely and effectively integrate the projects into their operations and such integration may result in unforeseen operating difficulties or unanticipated costs. Further, regulators may disallow recovery of some of the costs of a project if they are deemed not to be prudently incurred. Any of these or other factors could adversely affect the Companies’ ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the facility construction, pipeline, electric transmission line, expansion, conversion and other infrastructure projects. The development, construction and commissioning of several large-scale infrastructure projects simultaneously involves significant execution risk.  To achieve Dominion Energy’s commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 and comply with the requirements of the VCEA, the Companies are currently simultaneously developing or constructing several electric generation projects, including subsequent license renewal projects at Surry and North Anna, the CVOW Commercial Project, several electric transmission projects and various solar projects. Several of the Companies’ key projects are increasingly large-scale, complex and being constructed in constrained geographic areas or in unfamiliar environments such as the marine environment for the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind projects. The advancement of the Companies’ ventures is also affected by the interventions, litigation or other activities of stakeholder and advocacy groups, some of which oppose natural gas-related and energy infrastructure projects. For example, certain stakeholder groups oppose solar farms due to the increasing quantities of land tracts required for these facilities. Given that these projects provide the foundation for the Companies’ strategic growth plan, if the Companies are unable to obtain or maintain the required regulatory and other, including PJM, approvals, develop the necessary technical expertise, allocate and coordinate sufficient resources, adhere to budgets and timelines, effectively handle public outreach efforts, including its commitment to environmental justice, or otherwise fail to successfully execute the projects, there could be an adverse impact to the Companies’ financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Failure to comply with regulatory approval conditions or an adverse ruling in any future litigation could adversely affect the Companies’ ability to execute their business plan. The Companies are dependent on their contractors for the successful and timely completion of large-scale infrastructure projects. The construction of such projects is expected to take several years, is typically confined within a limited geographic area or difficult environments and could be subject to delays, supply chain disruption, cost overruns, inflation, labor disputes or shortages and other factors that could cause the total cost of the project to exceed the anticipated amount and adversely affect the Companies’ financial performance and/or impair the Companies’ ability to execute the business plan for the project as scheduled. Further, an inability to obtain financing or otherwise provide liquidity for the projects on acceptable terms, including any potential adverse conditions arising from or in connection with the comprehensive business review announced in November 2022, could negatively affect the Companies’ financial condition, cash flows, the projects’ anticipated financial results and/or impair the Companies’ ability to execute the business plan for the projects as scheduled. Operational Risks The Companies’ financial performance and condition can be affected by changes in the weather, including the effects of global climate change.  Fluctuations in weather can affect demand for the Companies’ services. For example, milder than normal weather can reduce demand for electricity and gas distribution services. In addition, severe weather or acts of nature, including hurricanes, winter storms, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters can stress systems, disrupt operation of the Companies’ facilities and cause service outages, production delays and property damage that require incurring additional expenses. Changes in weather conditions can result in reduced water levels or changes in water temperatures that could adversely affect operations at some of the Companies’ power stations. Furthermore, the Companies’ operations could be adversely affected and their physical plant placed at  40 greater risk of damage should changes in global climate produce, among other possible conditions, unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, abnormal levels of precipitation and, for operations located on or near coastlines, a change in sea level or sea temperatures. Due to the location of the Companies’ electric utility service territories and a number of its other facilities in the eastern portions of the states of South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia which are frequently in the path of hurricanes, the Companies experience the consequences of these weather events to a greater degree than many industry peers. Hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair the Companies’ operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information, damage the reputation of the Companies and otherwise have an adverse effect on the Companies’ business.  The Companies own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems. Further, the computer systems that run the Companies’ facilities are not completely isolated from external networks. There appears to be an increasing level of activity, sophistication and maturity of threat actors, in particular nation state actors, that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system and the U.S. gas transmission or distribution system. Such parties could view the Companies’ computer systems, software or networks as attractive targets for cyber attack. For example, malware has been designed to target software that runs the nation’s critical infrastructure such as power transmission grids and gas pipelines. In addition, the techniques used in cyber attacks evolve rapidly, including from emerging technologies, such as advanced forms of automation and artificial intelligence. The Companies’ businesses also require that they and their vendors collect and maintain sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss. A successful cyber attack through third-party or insider action on the systems that control the Companies’ electric generation, electric transmission, electric distribution or gas distribution assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing the Companies from serving customers or collecting revenues. The breach of certain business systems could affect the Companies’ ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to the Companies’ reputation. In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data at the Companies or one of their vendors could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring. If a significant breach were to occur, the reputation of the Companies also could be adversely affected. While the Companies maintain property and casualty insurance, along with other contractual provisions, that may cover certain damage caused by potential cyber incidents, all damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available. For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could materially and adversely affect the Companies’ business, financial condition and results of operations. The Companies’ financial results can be adversely affected by various factors driving supply and demand for electricity and gas and related services. Demand for the Companies’ services can be driven by changing populations within its utility service territories, significant new commercial or industrial customers or other changes in consumer habits. For example, data centers in Virginia Power’s service territory have been a source of significant increase in demand which is expected to continue over the next decade. Technological advances required by federal laws mandate new levels of energy efficiency in end-use devices, including lighting, furnaces and electric heat pumps and could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption. Additionally, certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by a fixed date. Likewise, certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering actions which could limit the use or installation of new natural gas appliances. Consumer demand for the Companies’ services may also be impacted by any price increases, including those driven by factors beyond the Companies’ control such as inflation or increased prices in natural gas.  Further, Virginia Power’s business model is premised upon the cost efficiency of the production, transmission and distribution of large-scale centralized utility generation. However, advances in distributed generation technologies, such as solar cells, gas microturbines, battery storage and fuel cells, may make these alternative generation methods competitive with large-scale utility generation, and change how customers acquire or use the Companies’ services. The widescale implementation of alternative generation methods could negatively impact the reliability of the Companies’ electric grid and/or result in significant costs to enhance the grid. Virginia Power has an exclusive franchise to serve retail electric customers in Virginia. However, Virginia’s Retail Access Statutes allow certain electric generation customers exceptions to this franchise. As market conditions change, Virginia Power’s customers may further pursue exceptions and Virginia Power’s exclusive franchise may erode. Increased energy demand or significant accelerated growth in demand due to new data centers, widespread adoption of electric vehicles or other customer changes could require enhancements to the Companies’ infrastructure. As discussed above, the ability of the Companies to construct new facilities is dependent upon factors outside of their control, including obtaining regulatory approvals, environmental and other permits. Any delays in, or inability to complete, construction of new facilities or expand and/or renew existing facilities could have an adverse effect on the Companies’ financial results.  In addition, purchased power from PJM or others may be from generation sources which emit more emissions than the Companies’ facilities, which could negatively impact Dominion Energy’s ability to meet its commitment to net zero emissions. Alternatively, reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due to customer adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, distributed generation, regional economic  41 conditions, or the impact of additional compliance obligations, unless substantially offset through regulatory cost allocations, could adversely impact the value of the Companies’ business activities. The Companies’ operations are subject to operational hazards, equipment failures, supply chain disruptions and personnel issues which could negatively affect the Companies.  Operation of the Companies’ facilities involves risk, including the risk of potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure, fuel supply, pipeline integrity or transportation disruptions, accidents, labor disputes or work stoppages by employees, acts of terrorism or sabotage, construction delays or cost overruns, shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material and labor, operational restrictions resulting from environmental limitations and governmental interventions, changes to the environment and performance below expected levels. The Companies’ businesses are dependent upon sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, the failure of which could prevent them from accomplishing critical business functions. Because the Companies’ transmission facilities, pipelines and other facilities are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of their facilities and pipelines could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties. Operation of the Companies’ facilities below expected capacity levels could result in lost revenues and increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs. Unplanned outages of the Companies’ facilities and extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of the Companies’ business. Unplanned outages typically increase the Companies’ operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce their revenues as a result of selling less output or may require the Companies to incur significant costs as a result of operating higher cost units or obtaining replacement output from third parties in the open market to satisfy forward energy and capacity or other contractual obligations. Moreover, if the Companies are unable to perform their contractual obligations, penalties or liability for damages could result. In addition, there are many risks associated with the Companies’ principal operations and the transportation and storage of natural gas including nuclear accidents, fires, explosions, uncontrolled release of natural gas and other environmental hazards, pole strikes, electric contact cases, the collision of third party equipment with pipelines and avian and other wildlife impacts. Such incidents could result in loss of human life or injuries among employees, customers or the public in general, environmental pollution, damage or destruction of facilities or business interruptions and associated public or employee safety impacts, loss of revenues, increased liabilities, heightened regulatory scrutiny and reputational risk. Further, the location of natural gas pipelines and associated distribution facilities, or electric generation, transmission, substations and distribution facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. The Companies may be materially adversely affected by negative publicity or the inability of Dominion Energy to meet its stated commitments.  From time to time, political and public sentiment may result in a significant amount of adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting the Companies. Any failure by Dominion Energy to realize its commitments to achieve net zero carbon and methane emissions by 2050, increase workforce diversity, enhance the customer experience or other long-term goals could lead to adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting the Companies. The ability to comply with some or all of Dominion Energy’s voluntary commitments may be outside of its control. For example, Dominion Energy is dependent on the actions of third parties to meet the expanded commitment regarding Scope 2 emissions and Scope 3 emissions. If downstream customers or upstream suppliers do not sufficiently reduce their GHG emissions, Dominion Energy may not achieve its net zero emissions goal. In addition, while the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project was cancelled in July 2020 and the legal proceedings and governmental investigations relating to the abandonment of the NND Project have been resolved, there is a risk that lingering negative publicity may continue.  Adverse press coverage and other adverse statements, whether or not driven by political or public sentiment, may also result in investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in legal claims as well as adverse outcomes. Addressing any adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny or enforcement or other legal proceedings is time consuming and expensive and, regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made, can have a negative impact on the reputation of the Companies, on the morale and performance of their employees and on their relationships with their respective regulators, customers and commercial counterparties. It may also have a negative impact on the Companies’ ability to take timely advantage of various business and market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects of negative publicity, and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may have a material adverse effect on the Companies’ business, financial condition and results of operations. Dominion Energy’s nonregulated generation business operates in a challenging market, which could adversely affect its results of operations and future growth.  The success of Dominion Energy’s contracted generation business depends upon favorable market conditions including the ability to sell power at prices sufficient to cover its operating costs. Dominion Energy operates in active wholesale markets that expose it to price volatility for electricity and nuclear fuel as well as the credit risk of counterparties. Dominion Energy attempts to manage its price risk by entering into long-term power purchase agreements with customers as well as hedging transactions, including short-term and long-term fixed price sales and purchase contracts. The failure of Dominion Energy to maintain,  42 renew or replace its existing long-term contracts on similar terms or with counterparties with similar credit profiles could result in a loss of revenue and/or decreased earnings and cash flows for Dominion Energy. In these wholesale markets, the spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the cost of supplying the next unit of electricity to the market during that hour. In many cases, the next unit of electricity supplied would be provided by generating stations that consume fossil fuels, primarily natural gas. Consequently, the open market wholesale price for electricity generally reflects the cost of natural gas plus the cost to convert the fuel to electricity. Therefore, changes in the price of natural gas generally affect the open market wholesale price of electricity. To the extent Dominion Energy does not enter into long-term power purchase agreements or otherwise effectively hedge its output, these changes in market prices could adversely affect its financial results. Dominion Energy purchases nuclear fuel primarily under long-term contracts. Dominion Energy is exposed to nuclear fuel cost volatility for the portion of its nuclear fuel obtained through short-term contracts or on the spot market, including as a result of market supply shortages. Nuclear fuel prices can be volatile and the price that can be obtained for power produced may not change at the same rate as nuclear fuel costs, thus adversely impacting Dominion Energy’s financial results. In addition, in the event that any of the contracted generation facilities experience a forced outage, Dominion Energy may not receive the level of revenue it anticipated. Dominion Energy conducts certain operations through partnership arrangements involving third-party investors which may limit Dominion Energy’s operational flexibility or result in an adverse impact on its financial results.  Certain of Dominion Energy’s operations are conducted through entities subject to partnership arrangements under which Dominion Energy has significant influence but does not control the operations of such entities or in which Dominion Energy’s control over such entities may be subject to certain rights of third-party investors. Accordingly, while Dominion Energy may have a certain level of control or influence over these entities, it may not have unilateral, or any, control over the day-to-day operations of these entities or over decisions that may have a material financial impact on the partnership participants, including Dominion Energy. In each case such partnership arrangements operate in accordance with their respective governance documents, and Dominion Energy is dependent upon third parties satisfying their respective obligations, including, as applicable, funding of their required share of capital expenditures. Such third-party investors have their own interests and objectives which may differ from those of Dominion Energy and, accordingly, disputes may arise amongst the owners of such partnership arrangements that may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses. War, acts and threats of terrorism, intentional acts and other significant events could adversely affect the Companies’ operations.  The Companies cannot predict the impact that any future terrorist attacks or retaliatory military or other action may have on the energy industry in general or on the Companies’ businesses in particular. Any such future attacks or retaliatory action may adversely affect the Companies’ operations in a variety of ways, including by disrupting the power, fuel and other markets in which the Companies operate or requiring the implementation of additional, more costly security guidelines and measures. The Companies’ infrastructure facilities, including nuclear facilities and projects under construction, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or other physical attack. Any physical compromise of the Companies’ facilities could adversely affect the Companies’ ability to generate, purchase, transmit or distribute electricity, distribute natural gas or otherwise operate their respective facilities in the most efficient manner or at all. For example, in December 2022 electric utilities in North Carolina and Washington experienced physical attacks on substations with the damage causing power outages. In addition, the amount and scope of insurance coverage maintained against losses resulting from any such attack may not be sufficient to cover such losses or otherwise adequately compensate for any business disruptions that could result. Instability in financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, intentional acts, pandemic, credit crises, recession or other factors could result in a significant decline in the U.S. economy and/or increase the cost or limit the availability of insurance or adversely impact the Companies’ ability to access capital on acceptable terms. Failure to attract and retain key executive officers and an appropriately qualified workforce could have an adverse effect on the Companies’ operations.  The Companies’ business strategy is dependent on their ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees. The Companies’ key executive officers are the CEO, CFO, COO and presidents and those responsible for financial, operational, legal, regulatory, accounting, tax, information technology and cybersecurity functions. Competition for skilled management employees in these areas of the Companies’ business operations is high. Certain events, such as an aging workforce, mismatch of skill set, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge base and the length of time required for skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employees, or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the Companies’ business. In addition, certain specialized knowledge is required of the Companies’ technical employees for construction and operation of transmission, generation and distribution assets. The Companies’ inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect their business and future operating results.  43 Nuclear Generation Risks The Companies have substantial ownership interests in and operate nuclear generating units; as a result, each may incur substantial costs and liabilities.  The Companies’ nuclear facilities are subject to operational, environmental, health and financial risks such as the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel, the ability to dispose of such spent nuclear fuel, the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance available, potential operational liabilities and extended outages, the costs of replacement power, the costs of maintenance and the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks. The Companies maintain decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage to minimize the financial exposure to these risks; however, it is possible that future decommissioning costs could exceed amounts in the decommissioning trusts and/or damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. If the Companies’ decommissioning trust funds are insufficient, and they are not allowed to recover the additional costs incurred through insurance or regulatory mechanisms, their results of operations could be negatively impacted. The Companies’ nuclear facilities are also subject to complex government regulation which could negatively impact their results of operations. The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generating facilities. In the event of noncompliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines, set license conditions, shut down a nuclear unit, or take some combination of these actions, depending on its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require the Companies to make substantial expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, although the Companies have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at their plants, if an incident did occur, it could materially and adversely affect their results of operations and/or financial condition. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world, such as the nuclear events in Japan in 2011, could cause the NRC to adopt increased safety regulations or otherwise limit or restrict the operation or licensing of domestic nuclear units. Financial, Economic and Market Risks Changing rating agency requirements could negatively affect the Companies’ growth and business strategy.  In order to maintain appropriate credit ratings to obtain needed credit at a reasonable cost in light of existing or future rating agency requirements, the Companies may find it necessary to take steps or change their business plans in ways that may adversely affect their growth and earnings. A reduction in the Companies’ credit ratings could result in an increase in borrowing costs, loss of access to certain markets, or both, thus adversely affecting operating results and could require the Companies to post additional collateral in connection with some of its price risk management activities. Dominion Energy may be unable to complete one or all the proposed sales of certain regulated gas distribution operations to Enbridge under the current terms and/or expected timing. The ability of Dominion Energy to complete the East Ohio, PSNC and Questar Gas Transactions, each of which are not conditioned upon the completion of the others, is dependent upon receiving clearance or approval under or by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, CFIUS, FCC and applicable state utility commissions, including the North Carolina, Utah and Wyoming Commissions, as well as other customary closing and regulatory conditions. The ability to obtain any remaining requisite regulatory approvals for each sale as well as the timing of such approvals is outside of Dominion Energy’s control. In addition, the terms and conditions associated with such approvals may result in additional requirements or obligations which may be burdensome or potentially result in the inability to complete one or all of the proposed sales under the current terms and/or expected timing. Such events could negatively impact Dominion Energy’s ability to implement certain of the recommendations in connection with the comprehensive business review announced in November 2022 as well as have a material adverse effect on Dominion Energy’s reputation, its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The Companies may be unable to complete the proposed sale of a 50% noncontrolling interest in the CVOW Commercial Project to Stonepeak under the current terms and/or expected timing. The ability of Virginia Power to complete the proposed sale of a 50% noncontrolling interest in the CVOW Commercial Project to Stonepeak through the formation of OSWP, is dependent upon receiving approval from the Virginia and North Carolina Commissions, consent from BOEM and other customary closing and regulatory conditions. The ability to obtain requisite regulatory approval as well as the timing of such approvals is outside of the Companies’ control. In addition, the terms and conditions associated with such approvals may result in additional requirements or obligations which may be burdensome or potentially result in the inability to complete the proposed transaction under the current terms and/or expected timing. Such events could negatively impact Dominion Energy’s ability to implement certain of the recommendations in connection with the comprehensive business review announced in November 2022 as well as have a material adverse effect on the Companies’ reputation, its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. An inability to access financial markets and, in the case of Dominion Energy, obtain cash from subsidiaries could adversely affect the execution of the Companies’ business plans.  The Companies rely on access to short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as significant sources of funding and liquidity for business plans with increasing capital expenditure needs, normal working capital and collateral requirements related to hedges of future sales and purchases of energy-related commodities.  44 Deterioration in the Companies’ creditworthiness, as evaluated by credit rating agencies or otherwise, or declines in market reputation either for the Companies or their industry in general, or general financial market disruptions outside of the Companies’ control could increase their cost of borrowing or restrict their ability to access one or more financial markets. In addition, any potential adverse conditions arising from or in connection with the comprehensive business review announced in November 2022 could affect the availability and/or cost of capital. Market disruptions could stem from general market disruption due to general credit market or political events, the reform or replacement of benchmark rates, the failure of financial institutions on which the Companies rely or the bankruptcy of an unrelated company. Increased costs and restrictions on the Companies’ ability to access financial markets may be severe enough to affect their ability to execute their business plans as scheduled. Dominion Energy is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries. Accordingly, Dominion Energy’s ability to execute its business plan is further subject to the earnings and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or advance or repay funds to it, which may, from time to time, be subject to certain contractual restrictions or restrictions imposed by regulators. Market performance, interest rates and other changes may decrease the value of the Companies’ decommissioning trust funds and Dominion Energy’s benefit plan assets or increase Dominion Energy’s liabilities, which could then require significant additional funding.  The performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trusts to satisfy future obligations to decommission the Companies’ nuclear plants and under Dominion Energy’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The Companies have significant obligations in these areas and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below expected return rates. With respect to decommissioning trust funds, a decline in the market value of these assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations to decommission the Companies’ nuclear plants or require additional NRC-approved funding assurance. A decline in the market value of the assets held in trusts to satisfy future obligations under Dominion Energy’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans may increase the funding requirements under such plans. Additionally, changes in interest rates will affect the liabilities under Dominion Energy’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in mortality assumptions, may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. If the decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets are negatively impacted by market fluctuations or other factors, the Companies’ results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows could be negatively affected. The use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses and liquidity constraints.  The Companies use derivative instruments, including futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs, to manage commodity, interest rate and/or foreign currency exchange rate risks. The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted into law in July 2010 in an effort to improve regulation of financial markets. The CEA, as amended by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, requires certain over-the-counter derivatives, or swaps, to be cleared through a derivatives clearing organization and, if the swap is subject to a clearing requirement, to be executed on a designated contract market or swap execution facility. Non-financial entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end users, may elect the end-user exception to the CEA’s clearing requirements. The Companies have elected to exempt their swaps from the CEA’s clearing requirements. If, as a result of changes to the rulemaking process, the Companies’ derivative activities are not exempted from the clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, the Companies could be subject to higher costs due to decreased market liquidity or increased margin payments. In addition, the Companies’ swap dealer counterparties may attempt to pass-through additional trading costs in connection with changes to or the elimination of rulemaking that implements Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. Future impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets or long-lived assets may have a material adverse effect on the Companies’ results of operations.  Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Other intangible assets and long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that an asset’s carrying value may not be recoverable. If Dominion Energy’s goodwill or the Companies’ other intangible assets or long-lived assets are in the future determined to be impaired, the applicable registrant would be required during the period in which the impairment is determined to record a noncash charge to earnings that may have a material adverse effect on the registrant’s results of operations. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2022, Dominion Energy determined that its nonregulated solar generation assets within Contracted Energy were impaired, resulting in a $685 million after-tax charge. In addition, Dominion Energy recorded a $286  45 million after-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2023 for the impairment of certain goodwill associated with the East Ohio and Questar Gas Transactions. Exposure to counterparty performance may adversely affect the Companies’ financial results of operations.  The Companies are exposed to credit risks of their counterparties and the risk that one or more counterparties may fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations, including but not limited to payment for services. Some of Dominion Energy’s operations are conducted through partnership arrangements, as noted above. Counterparties could fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations for a number of reasons, including the effect of regulations on their operations. Defaults or failure to perform by customers, suppliers, contractors, joint venture partners, financial institutions or other third parties may adversely affect the Companies’ financial results. Public health crises and epidemics or pandemics could adversely affect the Companies’ business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and/or cash flows.  The effects of an outbreak of a pandemic, such as COVID-19, and related government responses could include extended disruptions to supply chains and capital markets, reduced labor availability and productivity and a prolonged reduction in economic activity. The effects could also have a variety of adverse impacts on the Companies, including reduced demand for energy, particularly from commercial and industrial customers, impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets and diminished ability of the Companies to access funds from financial institutions and capital markets. Certain measures or restrictions taken to control a pandemic or similar event, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns, may cause operational interruptions and delays in construction projects. In addition, legislative or government action, such as legislation enacted in Virginia in November 2020, may limit the Companies’ ability to collect overdue accounts or disconnect services for non-payment, which may cause a decrease in the Companies’ results of operations and cash flows.   "
5,D,DOMINION ENERGY INC,2023-02-21,"Risk Factors
The Companies’ businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyond their control. A number of these factors have been identified below. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement or projection contained in this report, see Forward-Looking Statements in Item 7. MD&A. As discussed in Future Issues in Item 7. MD&A, Dominion Energy has commenced a comprehensive business review.  The outcomes of the business review and the implementation of the resulting recommendations may be subject to various risks and uncertainties (some of which may include the risks and uncertainties discussed below or other risks and uncertainties that cannot yet be determined) that could have a material impact on the Companies’ future results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition.Regulatory, Legislative and Legal Risks The rates of the Companies’ principal electric transmission, distribution and generation operations and gas distribution operations are subject to regulatory review.  Revenue provided by the Companies’ electric transmission, distribution and generation operations and by gas distribution operations is based primarily on rates approved by state and federal regulatory agencies. The profitability of the Companies’ businesses is dependent on their ability, through the rates that they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on their capital investment. At the federal level, the Companies’ wholesale rates for electric transmission service are regulated by FERC. Rates for electric transmission services are updated annually according to a FERC-approved formula rate mechanism, and may be subject to additional prospective adjustments and retroactive corrections. A failure by the Companies to support these rates could result in rate decreases from current rate levels, which could adversely affect the Companies’ results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. At the state level, Virginia Power’s retail base rates, terms and conditions for generation and distribution services to customers in Virginia are reviewed by the Virginia Commission in a proceeding that involves the determination of Virginia Power’s actual earned ROE during a historic test period, and the determination of Virginia Power’s authorized ROE prospectively. The GTSA reinstated triennial reviews commencing with the 2021 Triennial Review. Under certain circumstances described in the Regulation Act, Virginia Power may be required to refund a portion of its earnings to customers through a refund process and to reduce its rates. Additionally, Virginia Power’s ability to utilize CCROs for certain qualifying projects as provided for in the GTSA may be limited if the Virginia Commission does not approve such projects. Virginia Power makes assessments throughout the review period and will record a regulatory liability for refunds and/or CCRO benefits to customers in any period it is determined probable, which could be material to the Companies’ results of operations in the period recognized and to cash flows on completion of any triennial review. Several proposed legislative bills have been introduced in the Virginia General Assembly which, if ultimately enacted into law, could have a material impact on Virginia Power’s retail base rates and other cost-recovery mechanisms.  Items under consideration include frequency of base rate reviews, eliminating CCROs, shifting the recovery of certain costs currently recovered through riders into base rates and adjusting the parameters for determining an acceptable ROE and revenue sharing.   In states other than Virginia, the Companies’ retail electric base rates for generation and distribution services to customers are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to the statutes, rules and procedures of such states. Dominion Energy’s rates for gas distribution to retail customers are similarly regulated at the state level. If retail electric or gas earnings exceed the returns established by state utility commissions, retail electric rates or gas rates may be subject to review and possible reduction, which may decrease the Companies’ future earnings. Additionally, if any state utility commission does not allow recovery through base rates, on a timely basis, of costs incurred in providing service, the Company’s future earnings could be negatively impacted. Under certain circumstances, state utility regulators may impose a moratorium on increases to retail base rates for a specified period of time, which could delay recovery of costs incurred in providing service. Additionally, governmental officials, stakeholders and advocacy groups may challenge any of the regulatory reviews or proceedings referred to above. Such challenges may lengthen the time, complexity and costs associated with such regulatory reviews or proceedings. The Companies’ generation business may be negatively affected by possible FERC actions that could change market design in the wholesale markets or affect pricing rules or revenue calculations in the RTO markets.  The Companies’ generation stations operating in RTO markets sell capacity, energy and ancillary services into wholesale electricity markets regulated by FERC. The wholesale markets allow these generation stations to take advantage of market price opportunities, but also expose them to market risk. Properly functioning competitive wholesale markets depend upon FERC’s continuation of clearly identified market rules. From time to time FERC may investigate and authorize RTOs to make changes in market design. FERC also periodically reviews the Companies’ authority to sell at market-based rates. Material changes by FERC to the design of the wholesale markets or its interpretation of market rules, the Companies’ authority to sell power at market-based rates, or changes to pricing rules or rules involving revenue calculations, could adversely impact the future results of the Companies’ generation business. For example, in September 2021, FERC issued a final order that allows distributed energy resource aggregators to compete in regional wholesale  38electric markets. This rule followed a previous order which mandated that distributed energy resources be allowed to participate in wholesale markets.  RTOs, including PJM, are responsible for issuing implementation rules to FERC for approval. In addition, changes to the interpretation and application of FERC’s market manipulation rules may occur from time to time. A failure to comply with these market manipulation rules could lead to civil and criminal penalties. The Companies are subject to complex governmental regulation, including tax regulation, that could adversely affect their results of operations and subject the Companies to monetary penalties.  The Companies’ operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations and require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies. Such laws and regulations govern the terms and conditions of the services we offer, our relationships with affiliates, protection of our critical electric infrastructure assets and pipeline safety, among other matters. The Companies are also subject to legislation and associated regulation governing taxation at the federal, state and local level. They must also comply with environmental legislation and associated regulations. Management believes that the necessary approvals have been obtained for existing operations and that the businesses are conducted in accordance with applicable laws. The Companies’ businesses are subject to regulatory regimes which could result in substantial monetary penalties if either of the Companies is found not to be in compliance, including mandatory reliability standards and interaction in the wholesale markets. New laws or regulations, the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations, changes in enforcement practices of regulators, or penalties imposed for non-compliance with existing laws or regulations may result in substantial additional expense. Recent legislative and regulatory changes that are impacting the Companies include the IRA, the VCEA, the 2017 Tax Reform Act and tariffs imposed on imported solar panels by the U.S. government in 2018. The Companies have been and may continue to be or become subject to legal proceedings and governmental investigations and examinations.  The Companies may from time to time be subject to various legal proceedings and governmental investigations and examinations.  For example, Dominion Energy, following the SCANA Combination, has been subject to numerous federal and state legal proceedings and governmental investigations relating to the decision of SCANA and DESC to abandon construction at the NND Project. Dominion Energy has spent substantial amounts of time and money defending these lawsuits and proceedings and on related investigations. In addition, juries have demonstrated a willingness to grant large awards in certain cases, including personal injury claims. Accordingly, actual costs incurred may differ materially from insured or reserved amounts and may not be recoverable, in whole or in part, by insurance or in rates from our customers. The outcome of these or future legal proceedings, investigations and examinations, including settlements, may adversely affect the Companies’ financial condition or results of operation.Environmental Risks Compliance with federal and/or state requirements imposing limitations on GHG emissions or efficiency improvements, as well as Dominion Energy’s commitment to achieve net zero carbon and methane emissions by 2050, may result in significant compliance costs, could result in certain of the Companies’ existing electric generation units being uneconomical to maintain or operate and may depend upon technological advancements which may be beyond the Companies’ control.  Virginia has adopted the VCEA which establishes renewable energy and CO2 reduction targets for Virginia Power’s generation fleet and grid operations, including the requirement that 100% of Virginia Power’s electricity come from zero-carbon generation by the end of 2045.  The legislation mandates the development of 16.1 GW of solar or onshore wind capacity by the end of 2035, which includes specific requirements for utility-scale solar of 3.0 GW by the end of 2024, up to 15.0 GW by the end of 2035 and 1.1 GW of small-scale solar by the end of 2035. The legislation also deems 5.2 GW of offshore wind capacity before 2035 and 2.7 GW of energy storage by the end of 2035 to be in the public interest.  The VCEA and related legislation also authorizes Virginia to participate in a program consistent with RGGI, requiring the purchase of carbon credits to offset emissions from Virginia Power’s generating fleet within the state.  In January 2022, the Governor of Virginia issued an executive order which puts directives in place to start the withdrawal of Virginia from RGGI. Cost recovery for these initiatives will require approval by the Virginia Commission which may be denied or materially altered to the detriment of the Companies. For example, the Companies recorded charges in 2022 associated with the Virginia Commission's approval in June 2022 of Virginia Power's petition that RGGI compliance costs incurred and unrecovered through July 2022 be recovered through existing base rates in effect during the period incurred. In addition, permitting and other project execution challenges may hinder Virginia Power’s ability to meet the requirements of the VCEA. The Companies could face similar risks if there is further legislation at the federal and/or state level mandating additional limitations on GHG emissions or requiring additional efficiency improvements.     In February 2020, Dominion Energy announced its commitment to achieve net zero carbon and methane Scope 1 emissions by 2050. In February 2022, Dominion Energy expanded this commitment to cover Scope 2 emissions and material categories of Scope 3 emissions. To meet this commitment, the Companies expect to construct new electric generation facilities, including renewable facilities such as wind and solar, and to seek the extension of operating licenses for the Companies’ nuclear generation facilities. The Companies also need to depend on technological improvements not currently in commercial development. Additionally, actions taken in furtherance of Dominion Energy’s net zero commitment may impact existing generation facilities, including as a result of fuel switching and/or the retirement of high-emitting generation facilities and their potential replacement with lower-emitting generation facilities. Further, the ability to realize this commitment will require the Companies to be able to obtain significant financing. These  39efforts will require approvals from various regulatory bodies for the siting and construction of such new facilities and a determination by the applicable state commissions that costs related to the construction are prudent. Given these and other uncertainties associated with the implementation of Dominion Energy’s net zero commitment, the Companies cannot estimate the aggregate effect of future actions taken in furtherance of this commitment on their results of operations or financial condition or on their customers. However, such actions could render additional existing generation facilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect the Companies’ results of operations, financial performance or liquidity. There are also potential impacts on Dominion Energy’s natural gas business from its net zero emissions commitment as well as federal or state GHG regulations which may require further GHG emission reductions from the natural gas sector which, in addition to resulting in increased costs, could affect demand for natural gas. Additionally, GHG requirements could result in increased demand for energy conservation and renewable products, which could impact the natural gas business. Dominion Energy’s renewable natural gas projects, expected to be a key component of Dominion Energy’s environmental strategy, require approvals from various regulatory bodies for the siting and construction of such facilities. The Companies’ operations and construction activities are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations which impose significant compliance costs on the Companies.  The Companies’ operations and construction activities are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources, and health and safety. Compliance with these legal requirements requires the Companies to commit significant capital toward permitting, emission fees, environmental monitoring, installation and operation of environmental control equipment and purchase of allowances and/or offsets. Additionally, the Companies could be responsible for expenses relating to remediation and containment obligations, including at sites where they have been identified by a regulatory agency as a potentially responsible party. Expenditures relating to environmental compliance have been significant in the past, and the Companies expect that they will remain significant in the future. Certain facilities have become uneconomical to operate and have been shut down, converted to new fuel types or sold. These types of events could occur again in the future. We expect that existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and/or new laws may be adopted including regulation of GHG emissions which could have an impact on the Companies’ business (risks relating to regulation of GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units are discussed in more detail above and below). In addition, further regulation of air quality and GHG emissions under the CAA may be imposed on the natural gas sector. The Companies are also subject to federal water and waste regulations, including regulations concerning cooling water intake structures, coal combustion by-product handling and disposal practices, wastewater discharges from steam electric generating stations, management and disposal of hydraulic fracturing fluids and the potential further regulation of polychlorinated biphenyls. Compliance costs cannot be estimated with certainty due to the inability to predict the requirements and timing of implementation of any new environmental rules or regulations. Other factors which affect the ability to predict future environmental expenditures with certainty include the difficulty in estimating clean-up costs and quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liabilities on all responsible parties. However, such expenditures, if material, could make the Companies’ facilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect the Companies’ results of operations, financial performance or liquidity. The Companies are subject to risks associated with the disposal and storage of coal ash.  The Companies historically produced and continue to produce coal ash, or CCRs, as a by-product of their coal-fired generation operations. The ash is stored and managed in impoundments (ash ponds) and landfills located at 11 different facilities, eight of which are at Virginia Power. The EPA has issued regulations concerning the management and storage of CCRs, which Virginia has adopted. These CCR regulations require the Companies to make additional capital expenditures and increase operating and maintenance expenses. In addition, the Companies will incur expenses and other costs associated with closing, corrective action and ongoing monitoring of certain ash ponds and landfills. The Companies also may face litigation concerning their coal ash facilities. Further, while the Companies operate their ash ponds and landfills in compliance with applicable state safety regulations, a release of coal ash with a significant environmental impact could result in remediation costs, civil and/or criminal penalties, claims, litigation, increased regulation and compliance costs, and reputational damage, and could impact the financial condition of the Companies. Construction Risks The Companies’ infrastructure build and expansion plans often require regulatory approval, including environmental permits, before commencing construction and completing projects. The Companies may not complete the facility construction, pipeline, conversion or other infrastructure projects that they commence, or they may complete projects on materially different terms, costs or timing than initially estimated or anticipated, and they may not be able to achieve the intended benefits of any such project, if completed. A number of large and small scale projects have been announced, including electric  40transmission lines, pipeline replacements, facility expansions or renewed licensing, conversions and other infrastructure developments or construction. Additional projects may be considered in the future. The Companies compete for projects with companies of varying size and financial capabilities, including some that may have competitive advantages. Commencing construction on announced and future projects may require approvals from applicable state and federal agencies, and such approvals could include mitigation costs which may be material to the Companies. Projects may not be able to be completed on time or in accordance with our estimated costs as a result of weather conditions, delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory and other, including PJM, approvals, delays in obtaining key materials, labor difficulties, difficulties with partners or potential partners, concerns raised during stakeholder engagement, a decline in the credit strength of counterparties or vendors, inflation, or other factors beyond the Companies’ control. For example, Dominion Energy has been involved with projects which have experienced certain delays in obtaining and maintaining permits necessary for construction along with construction delays due to judicial actions which impacted the cost and schedule such as the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project and ultimately led to its cancellation in July 2020. Even if facility construction, pipeline, expansion, electric transmission line, conversion and other infrastructure projects are completed, the total costs of the projects may be higher than anticipated and the performance of the business of the Companies following completion of the projects may not meet expectations.  Start-up and operational issues can arise in connection with the commencement of commercial operations at our facilities. Such issues may include failure to meet specific operating parameters, which may require adjustments to meet or amend these operating parameters. Additionally, the Companies may not be able to timely and effectively integrate the projects into their operations and such integration may result in unforeseen operating difficulties or unanticipated costs. Further, regulators may disallow recovery of some of the costs of a project if they are deemed not to be prudently incurred. Any of these or other factors could adversely affect the Companies’ ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the facility construction, pipeline, electric transmission line, expansion, conversion and other infrastructure projects. The development and construction of the CVOW Commercial Project involves significant risks. The CVOW Commercial Project is a large-scale, complex project that will take several years to complete. Significant delays or cost increases, or an inability to recover certain project costs, could have an adverse effect on the Companies’ financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.  If the Companies are unable to complete the development and construction of the CVOW Commercial Project or decide in the future to delay or cancel the project, the Companies may not be able to recover all or a portion of their investment in the project and may incur substantial cancellation payments under existing contracts or other substantial costs associated with any such delay or cancellation. The Companies’ ability to complete the CVOW Commercial Project within the currently proposed timeline, or at all, and consistent with current cost estimates is subject to various risks and uncertainties, certain of which are beyond the Companies’ control.  The development and construction of the CVOW Commercial Project is dependent on the Companies’ ability to obtain and maintain various local, state and federal permits and other regulatory approvals, including Virginia Commission approval for rider recovery of project costs. In addition, the design and route of the project’s onshore electric transmission, network upgrades and other facilities remain subject to regulatory and PJM review and approval. Changes in the design and route of these onshore facilities, including an increase in amount of undergrounding, would likely increase project costs. Also, the CVOW Commercial Project may become the subject of litigation or other forms of intervention by third parties, including stakeholders or advocacy groups, that may impact the timing and receipt of permits or other regulatory approvals or otherwise delay or increase the cost of the project. The Companies’ ability to recover unforeseen cost increases associated with construction of the CVOW Commercial Project is potentially limited which could negatively impact the Companies’ future financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.  In accordance with the Virginia Commission’s order in December 2022, the Companies are subject to a cost sharing mechanism in which Virginia Power will be eligible to recover 50% of such incremental costs which fall between $10.3 billion and $11.3 billion with no recovery of such incremental costs which fall between $11.3 billion and $13.7 billion.  There is no cost sharing mechanism for any total construction costs in excess of $13.7 billion, the recovery of which would be determined in a future Virginia Commission preceding.  In addition, the order includes enhanced performance reporting provisions for the operation of the CVOW Commercial Project.  To the extent the net annual net capacity factor is below 42%, as determined on a three-year rolling average, Virginia Power is required to provide detailed explanation of the factors contributing to any shortfall to the Virginia Commission which could determine in a future proceeding a remedy for incremental costs incurred associated with any deemed unreasonable or imprudent actions of Virginia Power. Any such action by the Virginia Commission could adversely impact the Companies’ future financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. The Companies’ ability to invest the significant financial resources necessary for the CVOW Commercial Project is dependent on the Companies’ access to the financial markets in a timely and cost-effective manner. A decline in the Companies’ credit worthiness, an unfavorable market reputation of either the Companies or their industry or general market disruptions could adversely impact financing costs and increase the overall cost of the project. The development and construction of the CVOW Commercial Project is also dependent on the ability of certain key suppliers and contractors to timely satisfy their obligations under contracts entered into or expected to be entered into. Given the unique equipment and expertise required for this project, the Companies may not be able to remedy in a timely and cost-effective manner, if at all, any  41failure by one or more of these suppliers or contractors to timely satisfy their contractual obligations. Certain of the fixed price contracts for major offshore construction and equipment components are denominated in Euros and Danish kroner, including those which contain commodity indexing provisions linked to steel. In May 2022, Virginia Power entered into forward purchase agreements with a notional amount of approximately €3.2 billion. Accordingly, to the extent the instruments do not effectively hedge the Companies’ exposure to these currencies, including by default of the counterparty, adverse fluctuations in the applicable exchange rates would likely adversely affect the cost of the CVOW Commercial Project. Similarly, adverse fluctuations in the price of certain raw materials, including steel, would likely, to the extent not hedged by the Companies, adversely affect the overall costs incurred to develop and construct the project. The development and construction of the CVOW Commercial Project involves the use of new turbine technology and will take place in a marine environment, which presents unique challenges and will require the use of a specialized workforce and specialized equipment. In addition, the timely installation of the turbines is dependent on the completion and availability of a Jones Act compliant vessel currently under construction. The timeline for development and construction of the CVOW Commercial Project may also be negatively impacted by severe weather events or marine wildlife, including migration patterns of endangered and protected species, both of which are outside of the control of the Companies and their contractors. Any significant delays in the project timeline, including from any of the factors discussed above, resulting in both the delay of commencement of construction to 2024 or later combined with a delay to the in-service date to 2028 or later may impact the ability of the Companies to recover the costs of the CVOW Commercial Project. The development, construction and commissioning of several large-scale infrastructure projects simultaneously involves significant execution risk.  To achieve Dominion Energy’s commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 and comply with the requirements of the VCEA, the Companies are currently simultaneously developing or constructing several electric generation projects, including subsequent license renewal projects at Surry and North Anna, the CVOW Commercial Project and various solar projects. Several of the Companies’ key projects are increasingly large-scale, complex and being constructed in constrained geographic areas or in unfamiliar environments such as the marine environment for the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind projects. The advancement of the Companies’ ventures is also affected by the interventions, litigation or other activities of stakeholder and advocacy groups, some of which oppose natural gas-related and energy infrastructure projects. For example, certain stakeholder groups oppose solar farms due to the increasing quantities of land tracts required for these facilities. Given that these projects provide the foundation for the Companies’ strategic growth plan, if the Companies are unable to obtain or maintain the required regulatory and other, including PJM, approvals, develop the necessary technical expertise, allocate and coordinate sufficient resources, adhere to budgets and timelines, effectively handle public outreach efforts, including its commitment to environmental justice, or otherwise fail to successfully execute the projects, there could be an adverse impact to the Companies’ financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Failure to comply with regulatory approval conditions or an adverse ruling in any future litigation could adversely affect the Companies’ ability to execute their business plan. The Companies are dependent on their contractors for the successful and timely completion of large-scale infrastructure projects. The construction of such projects is expected to take several years, is typically confined within a limited geographic area or difficult environments and could be subject to delays, supply chain disruption, cost overruns, inflation, labor disputes or shortages and other factors that could cause the total cost of the project to exceed the anticipated amount and adversely affect the Companies’ financial performance and/or impair the Companies’ ability to execute the business plan for the project as scheduled. Further, an inability to obtain financing or otherwise provide liquidity for the projects on acceptable terms, including any potential adverse conditions arising from or in connection with the comprehensive business review announced in November 2022, could negatively affect the Companies’ financial condition, cash flows, the projects’ anticipated financial results and/or impair the Companies’ ability to execute the business plan for the projects as scheduled. Operational Risks The Companies’ financial performance and condition can be affected by changes in the weather, including the effects of global climate change.  Fluctuations in weather can affect demand for the Companies’ services. For example, milder than normal weather can reduce demand for electricity and gas distribution services. In addition, severe weather or acts of nature, including hurricanes, winter storms, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters can stress systems, disrupt operation of the Companies’ facilities and cause service outages, production delays and property damage that require incurring additional expenses. Changes in weather conditions can result in reduced water levels or changes in water temperatures that could adversely affect operations at some of the Companies’ power stations. Furthermore, the Companies’ operations could be adversely affected and their physical plant placed at greater risk of damage should changes in global climate produce, among other possible conditions, unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, abnormal levels of precipitation and, for operations located on or near coastlines, a change in sea level or sea temperatures. Due to the location of the Companies’ electric utility service territories and a number of its other facilities in the eastern portions of the states of South Carolina, North Carolina and  42Virginia which are frequently in the path of hurricanes, we experience the consequences of these weather events to a greater degree than many of our industry peers. Hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair the Companies’ operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information, damage the reputation of the Companies and otherwise have an adverse effect on the Companies’ business.  The Companies own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems. Further, the computer systems that run the Companies’ facilities are not completely isolated from external networks. There appears to be an increasing level of activity, sophistication and maturity of threat actors, in particular nation state actors, that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system and the U.S. gas transmission or distribution system. Such parties could view the Companies’ computer systems, software or networks as attractive targets for cyber attack. For example, malware has been designed to target software that runs the nation’s critical infrastructure such as power transmission grids and gas pipelines. In addition, the Companies’ businesses require that they and their vendors collect and maintain sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss. A successful cyber attack through third-party or insider action on the systems that control the Companies’ electric generation, electric transmission or distribution assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing the Companies from serving customers or collecting revenues. The breach of certain business systems could affect the Companies’ ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to the Companies’ reputation. In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data at the Companies or one of their vendors could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring. If a significant breach were to occur, the reputation of the Companies also could be adversely affected. While the Companies maintain property and casualty insurance, along with other contractual provisions, that may cover certain damage caused by potential cyber incidents, all damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available. For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could materially and adversely affect the Companies’ business, financial condition and results of operations. The Companies’ operations are subject to operational hazards, equipment failures, supply chain disruptions and personnel issues which could negatively affect the Companies.  Operation of the Companies’ facilities involves risk, including the risk of potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure, fuel supply, pipeline integrity or transportation disruptions, accidents, labor disputes or work stoppages by employees, acts of terrorism or sabotage, construction delays or cost overruns, shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material and labor, operational restrictions resulting from environmental limitations and governmental interventions, changes to the environment and performance below expected levels. The Companies’ businesses are dependent upon sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, the failure of which could prevent them from accomplishing critical business functions. Because the Companies’ transmission facilities, pipelines and other facilities are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of their facilities and pipelines could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties. Operation of the Companies’ facilities below expected capacity levels could result in lost revenues and increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs. Unplanned outages of the Companies’ facilities and extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of the Companies’ business. Unplanned outages typically increase the Companies’ operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce their revenues as a result of selling less output or may require the Companies to incur significant costs as a result of operating higher cost units or obtaining replacement output from third parties in the open market to satisfy forward energy and capacity or other contractual obligations. Moreover, if the Companies are unable to perform their contractual obligations, penalties or liability for damages could result. In addition, there are many risks associated with the Companies’ principal operations and the transportation and storage of natural gas  including nuclear accidents, fires, explosions, uncontrolled release of natural gas and other environmental hazards, pole strikes, electric contact cases, the collision of third party equipment with pipelines and avian and other wildlife impacts. Such incidents could result in loss of human life or injuries among employees, customers or the public in general, environmental pollution, damage or destruction of facilities or business interruptions and associated public or employee safety impacts, loss of revenues, increased liabilities, heightened regulatory scrutiny and reputational risk. Further, the location of natural gas pipelines and associated distribution facilities, or electric generation, transmission, substations and distribution facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. The Companies’ financial results can be adversely affected by various factors driving supply and demand for electricity and gas and related services. Technological advances required by federal laws mandate new levels of energy efficiency in end-use devices, including lighting, furnaces and electric heat pumps and could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption. Additionally, certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by a fixed date. Likewise, certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering actions  43which could limit the use or installation of new natural gas appliances. Consumer demand for our services may also be impacted by any price increases, including those driven by factors beyond our control such as inflation or increased prices in natural gas.  Further, Virginia Power’s business model is premised upon the cost efficiency of the production, transmission and distribution of large-scale centralized utility generation. However, advances in distributed generation technologies, such as solar cells, gas microturbines, battery storage and fuel cells, may make these alternative generation methods competitive with large-scale utility generation, and change how customers acquire or use the Companies’ services. The widescale implementation of alternative generation methods could negatively impact the reliability of the Companies’ electric grid and/or result in significant costs to enhance the grid. Virginia Power has an exclusive franchise to serve retail electric customers in Virginia. However, Virginia’s Retail Access Statutes allow certain electric generation customers exceptions to this franchise. As market conditions change, Virginia Power’s customers may further pursue exceptions and Virginia Power’s exclusive franchise may erode. Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due to customer adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, distributed generation, regional economic conditions, or the impact of additional compliance obligations, unless substantially offset through regulatory cost allocations, could adversely impact the value of the Companies’ business activities. The Companies may be materially adversely affected by negative publicity or the inability of Dominion Energy to meet its stated commitments.  From time to time, political and public sentiment may result in a significant amount of adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting the Companies. Any failure by Dominion Energy to realize its commitments to achieve net zero carbon and methane emissions by 2050, increase workforce diversity, enhance the customer experience or other long-term goals could lead to adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting the Companies. The ability to comply with some or all of Dominion Energy’s voluntary commitments may be outside of its control. For example, Dominion Energy is dependent on the actions of third parties to meet the expanded commitment regarding Scope 2 emissions and Scope 3 emissions. If downstream customers or upstream suppliers do not sufficiently reduce their GHG emissions, Dominion Energy may not achieve its net zero emissions goal. In addition, while the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project was cancelled in July 2020 and several of the legal proceedings and governmental investigations relating to the abandonment of the NND Project have been resolved, there is a risk that lingering negative publicity may continue.  Adverse press coverage and other adverse statements, whether or not driven by political or public sentiment, may also result in investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in legal claims as well as adverse outcomes. Addressing any adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny or enforcement or other legal proceedings is time consuming and expensive and, regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made, can have a negative impact on the reputation of the Companies, on the morale and performance of their employees and on their relationships with their respective regulators, customers and commercial counterparties. It may also have a negative impact on the Companies’ ability to take timely advantage of various business and market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects of negative publicity, and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may have a material adverse effect on the Companies’ business, financial condition and results of operations. Dominion Energy’s nonregulated generation business operates in a challenging market, which could adversely affect its results of operations and future growth.  The success of Dominion Energy’s contracted generation business depends upon favorable market conditions including the ability to sell power at prices sufficient to cover its operating costs. Dominion Energy operates in active wholesale markets that expose it to price volatility for electricity and nuclear fuel as well as the credit risk of counterparties. Dominion Energy attempts to manage its price risk by entering into long-term power purchase agreements with customers as well as hedging transactions, including short-term and long-term fixed price sales and purchase contracts. The failure of Dominion Energy to maintain, renew or replace its existing long-term contracts on similar terms or with counterparties with similar credit profiles could result in a loss of revenue and/or decreased earnings and cash flows for Dominion Energy. In these wholesale markets, the spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the cost of supplying the next unit of electricity to the market during that hour. In many cases, the next unit of electricity supplied would be provided by generating stations that consume fossil fuels, primarily natural gas. Consequently, the open market wholesale price for electricity generally reflects the cost of natural gas plus the cost to convert the fuel to electricity. Therefore, changes in the price of natural gas generally affect the open market wholesale price of electricity. To the extent Dominion Energy does not enter into long-term power purchase agreements or otherwise effectively hedge its output, these changes in market prices could adversely affect its financial results. Dominion Energy purchases nuclear fuel primarily under long-term contracts. Dominion Energy is exposed to nuclear fuel cost volatility for the portion of its nuclear fuel obtained through short-term contracts or on the spot market, including as a result of market supply shortages. Nuclear fuel prices can be volatile and the price that can be obtained for power produced may not change at the same rate as nuclear fuel costs, thus adversely impacting Dominion Energy’s financial results. In addition, in the event that any of the contracted generation facilities experience a forced outage, Dominion Energy may not receive the level of revenue it anticipated. Dominion Energy conducts certain operations through partnership arrangements involving third-party investors which may limit Dominion Energy’s operational flexibility or result in an adverse impact on its financial results.  Certain of Dominion  44Energy’s operations are conducted through entities subject to partnership arrangements under which Dominion Energy has significant influence but does not control the operations of such entities or in which Dominion Energy’s control over such entities may be subject to certain rights of third-party investors. Accordingly, while Dominion Energy may have a certain level of control or influence over these entities, it may not have unilateral, or any, control over the day-to-day operations of these entities or over decisions that may have a material financial impact on the partnership participants, including Dominion Energy. In each case such partnership arrangements operate in accordance with their respective governance documents, and Dominion Energy is dependent upon third parties satisfying their respective obligations, including, as applicable, funding of their required share of capital expenditures. Such third-party investors have their own interests and objectives which may differ from those of Dominion Energy and, accordingly, disputes may arise amongst the owners of such partnership arrangements that may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses. For example, Dominion Energy has a noncontrolling 50% interest in Cove Point following the sale of a 25% controlling interest to BHE in November 2020. This controlling interest allows BHE to make decisions affecting Cove Point’s ability to retain its long-term contracts.  Cove Point is a party to certain contracts that allow a regulated service provider and a customer to mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a “negotiated rate” which may be above or below the FERC regulated, cost-based recourse rate for that service. These “negotiated rate” contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased costs which could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services. Any shortfall of revenue as a result of these “negotiated rate” contracts could decrease Cove Point’s earnings and cash flows.  The inability to maintain or renew such contracts on favorable terms may have a material impact to Dominion Energy’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  Dominion Energy is also dependent upon BHE for managing counterparty credit risk relating to Cove Point’s terminal services agreements for its liquefied natural gas export/liquefaction facility. While the counterparties’ obligations are supported by parental guarantees and letters of credit, there is no assurance that such credit support would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations in the event of a counterparty default. In addition, if a controversy arises under either terminal services agreement resulting in a judgment in Cove Point’s favor, Cove Point may need to seek to enforce a final U.S. court judgment in a foreign tribunal, which could involve a lengthy process. Accordingly, there is no assurance that BHE may pursue remedies in the event of default in the same manner as Dominion Energy would if it had unilateral control over such decisions. War, acts and threats of terrorism, intentional acts and other significant events could adversely affect the Companies’ operations.  The Companies cannot predict the impact that any future terrorist attacks or retaliatory military or other action may have on the energy industry in general or on the Companies’ businesses in particular. Any such future attacks or retaliatory action may adversely affect the Companies’ operations in a variety of ways, including by disrupting the power, fuel and other markets in which the Companies operate or requiring the implementation of additional, more costly security guidelines and measures. The Companies’ infrastructure facilities, including nuclear facilities and projects under construction, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or other physical attack. Any physical compromise of the Companies’ facilities could adversely affect the Companies’ ability to generate, purchase, transmit or distribute electricity, distribute natural gas or otherwise operate their respective facilities in the most efficient manner or at all. For example, in December 2022 electric utilities in North Carolina and Washington experienced physical attacks on substations with the damage causing power outages. In addition, the amount and scope of insurance coverage maintained against losses resulting from any such attack may not be sufficient to cover such losses or otherwise adequately compensate for any business disruptions that could result. Instability in financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, intentional acts, pandemic, credit crises, recession or other factors could result in a significant decline in the U.S. economy and/or increase the cost or limit the availability of insurance or adversely impact the Companies’ ability to access capital on acceptable terms. Failure to attract and retain key executive officers and an appropriately qualified workforce could have an adverse effect on the Companies’ operations.  The Companies’ business strategy is dependent on their ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees. The Companies’ key executive officers are the CEO, CFO, COO and presidents and those responsible for financial, operational, legal, regulatory, accounting, tax, information technology and cybersecurity functions. Competition for skilled management employees in these areas of the Companies’ business operations is high. Certain events, such as an aging workforce, mismatch of skill set, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge base and the length of time required for skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employees, or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the Companies’ business. In addition, certain specialized knowledge is required of the Companies’ technical employees for construction and operation of transmission, generation and distribution assets. The Companies’ inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect their business and future operating results.  45Nuclear Generation Risks The Companies have substantial ownership interests in and operate nuclear generating units; as a result, each may incur substantial costs and liabilities.  The Companies’ nuclear facilities are subject to operational, environmental, health and financial risks such as the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel, the ability to dispose of such spent nuclear fuel, the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance available, potential operational liabilities and extended outages, the costs of replacement power, the costs of maintenance and the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks. The Companies maintain decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage to minimize the financial exposure to these risks; however, it is possible that future decommissioning costs could exceed amounts in the decommissioning trusts and/or damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. If the Companies’ decommissioning trust funds are insufficient, and they are not allowed to recover the additional costs incurred through insurance or regulatory mechanisms, their results of operations could be negatively impacted. The Companies’ nuclear facilities are also subject to complex government regulation which could negatively impact their results of operations. The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generating facilities. In the event of noncompliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines, set license conditions, shut down a nuclear unit, or take some combination of these actions, depending on its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require the Companies to make substantial expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, although the Companies have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at their plants, if an incident did occur, it could materially and adversely affect their results of operations and/or financial condition. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world, such as the nuclear events in Japan in 2011, could cause the NRC to adopt increased safety regulations or otherwise limit or restrict the operation or licensing of domestic nuclear units. Financial, Economic and Market Risks Changing rating agency requirements could negatively affect the Companies’ growth and business strategy.  In order to maintain appropriate credit ratings to obtain needed credit at a reasonable cost in light of existing or future rating agency requirements, the Companies may find it necessary to take steps or change their business plans in ways that may adversely affect their growth and earnings. A reduction in the Companies’ credit ratings could result in an increase in borrowing costs, loss of access to certain markets, or both, thus adversely affecting operating results and could require the Companies to post additional collateral in connection with some of its price risk management activities. An inability to access financial markets and, in the case of Dominion Energy, obtain cash from subsidiaries could adversely affect the execution of the Companies’ business plans.  The Companies rely on access to short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as significant sources of funding and liquidity for business plans with increasing capital expenditure needs, normal working capital and collateral requirements related to hedges of future sales and purchases of energy-related commodities. Deterioration in the Companies’ creditworthiness, as evaluated by credit rating agencies or otherwise, or declines in market reputation either for the Companies or their industry in general, or general financial market disruptions outside of the Companies’ control could increase their cost of borrowing or restrict their ability to access one or more financial markets. In addition, any potential adverse conditions arising from or in connection with the comprehensive business review announced in November 2022 could affect the availability and/or cost of capital. Market disruptions could stem from general market disruption due to general credit market or political events, the planned phase out of LIBOR by the end of 2023 or the reform or replacement of other benchmark rates, the failure of financial institutions on which the Companies rely or the bankruptcy of an unrelated company. Increased costs and restrictions on the Companies’ ability to access financial markets may be severe enough to affect their ability to execute their business plans as scheduled. Dominion Energy is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries. Accordingly, Dominion Energy’s ability to execute its business plan is further subject to the earnings and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or advance or repay funds to it, which may, from time to time, be subject to certain contractual restrictions or restrictions imposed by regulators. Market performance, interest rates and other changes may decrease the value of the Companies’ decommissioning trust funds and Dominion Energy’s benefit plan assets or increase Dominion Energy’s liabilities, which could then require significant additional funding.  The performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trusts to satisfy future obligations to decommission the Companies’ nuclear plants and under Dominion Energy’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The Companies have significant obligations in these areas and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below expected return rates. With respect to decommissioning trust funds, a decline in the market value of these assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations to decommission the Companies’ nuclear plants or require additional NRC-approved funding assurance. 46 A decline in the market value of the assets held in trusts to satisfy future obligations under Dominion Energy’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans may increase the funding requirements under such plans. Additionally, changes in interest rates will affect the liabilities under Dominion Energy’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in mortality assumptions, may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. If the decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets are negatively impacted by market fluctuations or other factors, the Companies’ results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows could be negatively affected. The use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses and liquidity constraints.  The Companies use derivative instruments, including futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs, to manage commodity, interest rate and/or foreign currency exchange rate risks. The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted into law in July 2010 in an effort to improve regulation of financial markets. The CEA, as amended by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, requires certain over-the-counter derivatives, or swaps, to be cleared through a derivatives clearing organization and, if the swap is subject to a clearing requirement, to be executed on a designated contract market or swap execution facility. Non-financial entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end users, may elect the end-user exception to the CEA’s clearing requirements. The Companies have elected to exempt their swaps from the CEA’s clearing requirements. If, as a result of changes to the rulemaking process, the Companies’ derivative activities are not exempted from the clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, the Companies could be subject to higher costs due to decreased market liquidity or increased margin payments. In addition, the Companies’ swap dealer counterparties may attempt to pass-through additional trading costs in connection with changes to or the elimination of rulemaking that implements Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. Future impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets or long-lived assets may have a material adverse effect on the Companies’ results of operations.  Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Other intangible assets and long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that an asset’s carrying value may not be recoverable. If Dominion Energy’s goodwill or the Companies’ other intangible assets or long-lived assets are in the future determined to be impaired, the applicable registrant would be required during the period in which the impairment is determined to record a noncash charge to earnings that may have a material adverse effect on the registrant's results of operations. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2022, Dominion Energy determined that its nonregulated solar generation assets within Contracted Assets were impaired, resulting in a $1.1 billion after-tax charge.  Exposure to counterparty performance may adversely affect the Companies’ financial results of operations.  The Companies are exposed to credit risks of their counterparties and the risk that one or more counterparties may fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations, including but not limited to payment for services. Some of Dominion Energy’s operations are conducted through partnership arrangements, as noted above. Counterparties could fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations for a number of reasons, including the effect of regulations on their operations. Defaults or failure to perform by customers, suppliers, contractors, joint venture partners, financial institutions or other third parties may adversely affect the Companies’ financial results. Public health crises and epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19, could adversely affect the Companies’ business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and/or cash flows.  The effects of the continued outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government responses could include extended disruptions to supply chains and capital markets, reduced labor availability and productivity and a prolonged reduction in economic activity. The effects could also have a variety of adverse impacts on the Companies, including reduced demand for energy, particularly from commercial and industrial customers, impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets and diminished ability of the Companies to access funds from financial institutions and capital markets.  There remains uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. Such restrictions may cause operational interruptions and delays in construction projects, which, in the case of renewable energy projects, could delay the expected in-service dates of these projects and financial statement impact of the investment tax credits associated with these projects. For the duration of the outbreak of COVID-19, voluntary suspension, or potential legislative or government action, such as legislation enacted in Virginia in November 2020, may limit the Companies’ ability to collect on overdue accounts or disconnect services for non-payment, which may cause a decrease in the Companies’ results of operations and cash flows.   47"
1,D,DOMINION ENERGY INC,2022-02-24,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
The Companies’ businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyond their control. A number of these factors have been identified below. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement or projection contained in this report, see Forward-Looking Statements in Item 7. MD&A. Regulatory, Legislative and Legal Risks The rates of the Companies’ principal electric transmission, distribution and generation operations and gas distribution operations are subject to regulatory review.  Revenue provided by the Companies’ electric transmission, distribution and generation operations and by gas distribution operations is based primarily on rates approved by state and federal regulatory agencies. The profitability of the Companies’ businesses is dependent on their ability, through the rates that they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on their capital investment. At the federal level, the Companies’ wholesale rates for electric transmission service are regulated by FERC. Rates for electric transmission services are updated annually according to a FERC-approved formula rate mechanism, and may be subject to additional prospective adjustments and retroactive corrections. A failure by the Companies to support these rates could result in rate decreases from current rate levels, which could adversely affect the Companies’ results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. At the state level, Virginia Power’s retail base rates, terms and conditions for generation and distribution services to customers in Virginia are reviewed by the Virginia Commission in a proceeding that involves the determination of Virginia Power’s actual earned ROE during a historic test period, and the determination of Virginia Power’s authorized ROE prospectively. The GTSA reinstated triennial reviews commencing with the 2021 Triennial Review. Under certain circumstances described in the Regulation Act, Virginia Power may be required to refund a portion of its earnings to customers through a refund process and to reduce its rates. Additionally, Virginia Power’s ability to utilize CCROs for certain qualifying projects as provided for in the GTSA may be limited if the Virginia Commission does not approve such projects. Virginia Power makes assessments throughout the review period and will record a regulatory liability for refunds and/or CCRO benefits to customers in any period it is determined probable, which could be material to the Companies’ results of operations in the period recognized and to cash flows on completion of any triennial review.  In states other than Virginia, the Companies’ retail electric base rates for generation and distribution services to customers are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to the statutes, rules and procedures of such states. Dominion Energy’s rates for gas distribution to retail customers are similarly regulated at the state level. If retail electric or gas earnings exceed the returns established by state utility commissions, retail electric rates or gas rates may be subject to review and possible reduction, which may decrease the Companies’ future earnings. Additionally, if any state utility commission does not allow recovery through base rates, on a timely basis, of costs incurred in providing service, the Company’s future earnings could be negatively impacted. Under certain circumstances, state utility regulators may impose a moratorium on increases to retail base rates for a specified period of time, which could delay recovery of costs incurred in providing service. Additionally, governmental officials, stakeholders and advocacy groups may challenge any of these regulatory reviews. Such challenges may lengthen the time, complexity and costs associated with such regulatory reviews. The Companies’ generation business may be negatively affected by possible FERC actions that could change market design in the wholesale markets or affect pricing rules or revenue calculations in the RTO markets.  The Companies’ generation stations operating in RTO markets sell capacity, energy and ancillary services into wholesale electricity markets regulated by FERC. The wholesale markets allow these generation stations to take advantage of market price opportunities, but also expose them to market risk. Properly functioning competitive wholesale markets depend upon FERC’s continuation of clearly identified market rules. From time to time FERC may investigate and authorize RTOs to make changes in market design. FERC also periodically reviews the Companies’ authority to sell at market-based rates. Material changes by FERC to the design of the wholesale markets or its interpretation of market rules, the Companies’ authority to sell power at market-based rates, or changes to pricing rules or rules involving revenue calculations, could adversely impact the future results of the Companies’ generation business. For example, in September 2021, FERC issued a final order that allows distributed energy resource aggregators to compete in regional wholesale electric markets. This rule followed a previous order which mandated that distributed energy resources be allowed to participate in wholesale markets.  RTOs, including PJM, are responsible for issuing implementation rules to FERC for approval. In addition, in December 2019, FERC issued an order on PJM’s Minimum Offer Price Rule proposals finding the PJM tariff unjust and unreasonable and directed PJM to expand the Minimum Offer Price Rule to all existing and new generation resources benefitting from a state subsidy to address the effects of state subsidies on new and existing resources on the PJM capacity market. The expanded Minimum Offer Price Rule will set a floor price on new and existing renewable and non-renewable state subsidized resources that do not seek a FERC exemption, increasing their risk of failing to clear the capacity auction and not obtaining a capacity payment and obligation. In addition, changes to the interpretation and application of FERC’s market manipulation rules may occur from time to time. A failure to comply with these market manipulation rules could lead to civil and criminal penalties.37  The Companies are subject to complex governmental regulation, including tax regulation, that could adversely affect their results of operations and subject the Companies to monetary penalties.  The Companies’ operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation and require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies. Such laws and regulations govern the terms and conditions of the services we offer, our relationships with affiliates, protection of our critical electric infrastructure assets and pipeline safety, among other matters. These operations are also subject to legislation governing taxation at the federal, state and local level. They must also comply with environmental legislation and associated regulations. Management believes that the necessary approvals have been obtained for existing operations and that the businesses are conducted in accordance with applicable laws. The Companies’ businesses are subject to regulatory regimes which could result in substantial monetary penalties if any of the Companies is found not to be in compliance, including mandatory reliability standards and interaction in the wholesale markets. New laws or regulations, the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations, changes in enforcement practices of regulators, or penalties imposed for non-compliance with existing laws or regulations may result in substantial additional expense. Recent legislative and regulatory changes that are impacting the Companies include the VCEA, the 2017 Tax Reform Act and tariffs imposed on imported solar panels by the U.S. government in 2018. The Companies have been and may continue to be or become subject to legal proceedings and governmental investigations and examinations.  Dominion Energy, following the SCANA Combination, has been subject to numerous federal and state legal proceedings and governmental investigations relating to the decision of SCANA and DESC to abandon construction at the NND Project. Dominion Energy has spent, and continues to spend, substantial amounts of time and money defending these lawsuits and proceedings and on related investigations. In addition, juries have demonstrated a willingness to grant large awards in certain cases, including personal injury claims. Accordingly, actual costs incurred may differ materially from insured or reserved amounts and may not be recoverable, in whole or in part, by insurance or in rates from our customers. The outcome of these or future legal proceedings, investigations and examinations, including settlements, may adversely affect the Companies’ financial condition or results of operation.Environmental Risks Compliance with federal and/or state requirements imposing limitations on GHG emissions or efficiency improvements, as well as Dominion Energy’s commitment to achieve net zero carbon and methane emissions by 2050, may result in significant compliance costs, could result in certain of the Companies’ existing electric generation units being uneconomical to maintain or operate and may depend upon technological advancements which may be beyond the Companies’ control.  Virginia has adopted the VCEA which establishes renewable energy and CO2 reduction targets for Virginia Power’s generation fleet and grid operations, including the requirement that 100% of Virginia Power’s electricity come from zero-carbon generation by the end of 2045.  The legislation mandates the development of 16.1 GW of solar or onshore wind capacity by the end of 2035, which includes specific requirements for utility-scale solar of 3.0 GW by the end of 2024, up to 15.0 GW by the end of 2035 and 1.1 GW of small-scale solar by the end of 2035. The legislation also deems 5.2 GW of offshore wind capacity before 2035 and 2.7 GW of energy storage by the end of 2035 to be in the public interest.  The VCEA and related legislation also directs Virginia to participate in a program consistent with RGGI, requiring the purchase of carbon credits to offset emissions from Virginia Power’s generating fleet within the state.  In January 2022, the Governor of Virginia issued an executive order which puts directives in place to start the withdrawal of Virginia from RGGI. Cost recovery for these initiatives will require approval by the Virginia Commission which may be denied or materially altered to the detriment of the Companies.  In addition, permitting and other project execution challenges may hinder Virginia Power’s ability to meet the requirements of the VCEA.  The Companies could face similar risks if there is further legislation at the federal and/or state level mandating additional limitations on GHG emissions or requiring additional efficiency improvements.    In February 2020, Dominion Energy announced its commitment to achieve net zero carbon and methane Scope 1 emissions by 2050. In February 2022, Dominion Energy expanded this commitment to cover Scope 2 emissions and material categories of Scope 3 emissions. To meet this commitment, the Companies expect to construct new electric generation facilities, including renewable facilities such as wind and solar, and to seek the extension of operating licenses for the Companies’ nuclear generation facilities. The Companies also need to depend on technological improvements not currently in commercial development. Additionally, actions taken in furtherance of Dominion Energy’s net zero commitment may impact existing generation facilities, including as a result of fuel switching and/or the retirement of high-emitting generation facilities and their potential replacement with lower-emitting generation facilities. Further, the ability to realize this commitment will require the Companies to be able to obtain significant financing. These efforts will require approvals from various regulatory bodies for the siting and construction of such new facilities and a determination by the applicable state commissions that costs related to the construction are prudent. Given these and other uncertainties associated with the implementation of Dominion Energy’s net zero commitment, the Companies cannot estimate the aggregate effect of future actions taken in furtherance of this commitment on their results of operations or financial condition or on their customers. However, such actions could render additional existing generation facilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect the Companies’ results of operations, financial performance or liquidity. There are also potential impacts on Dominion Energy’s natural gas business from its net zero emissions commitment as well as federal or state GHG regulations which may require further GHG emission reductions from the natural gas sector which, in addition to 38 resulting in increased costs, could affect demand for natural gas. Additionally, GHG requirements could result in increased demand for energy conservation and renewable products, which could impact the natural gas business. Dominion Energy’s renewable natural gas projects, expected to be a key component of Dominion Energy’s environmental strategy, require approvals from various regulatory bodies for the siting and construction of such facilities. The Companies’ operations and construction activities are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations which impose significant compliance costs on the Companies.  The Companies’ operations and construction activities are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources, and health and safety. Compliance with these legal requirements requires the Companies to commit significant capital toward permitting, emission fees, environmental monitoring, installation and operation of environmental control equipment and purchase of allowances and/or offsets. Additionally, the Companies could be responsible for expenses relating to remediation and containment obligations, including at sites where they have been identified by a regulatory agency as a potentially responsible party. Expenditures relating to environmental compliance have been significant in the past, and the Companies expect that they will remain significant in the future. Certain facilities have become uneconomical to operate and have been shut down, converted to new fuel types or sold. These types of events could occur again in the future. We expect that existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and/or new laws may be adopted including regulation of GHG emissions which could have an impact on the Companies’ business (risks relating to regulation of GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units are discussed in more detail below). In addition, further regulation of air quality and GHG emissions under the CAA may be imposed on the natural gas sector. The Companies are also subject to federal water and waste regulations, including regulations concerning cooling water intake structures, coal combustion by-product handling and disposal practices, wastewater discharges from steam electric generating stations, management and disposal of hydraulic fracturing fluids and the potential further regulation of polychlorinated biphenyls. Compliance costs cannot be estimated with certainty due to the inability to predict the requirements and timing of implementation of any new environmental rules or regulations. Other factors which affect the ability to predict future environmental expenditures with certainty include the difficulty in estimating clean-up costs and quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liabilities on all responsible parties. However, such expenditures, if material, could make the Companies’ facilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect the Companies’ results of operations, financial performance or liquidity. The Companies are subject to risks associated with the disposal and storage of coal ash.  The Companies historically produced and continue to produce coal ash, or CCRs, as a by-product of their coal-fired generation operations. The ash is stored and managed in impoundments (ash ponds) and landfills located at 11 different facilities, eight of which are at Virginia Power. The EPA has issued regulations concerning the management and storage of CCRs, which Virginia has adopted. These CCR regulations require the Companies to make additional capital expenditures and increase operating and maintenance expenses. In addition, the Companies will incur expenses and other costs associated with closing, corrective action and ongoing monitoring of certain ash ponds and landfills. The Companies also may face litigation concerning their coal ash facilities. Further, while the Companies operate their ash ponds and landfills in compliance with applicable state safety regulations, a release of coal ash with a significant environmental impact could result in remediation costs, civil and/or criminal penalties, claims, litigation, increased regulation and compliance costs, and reputational damage, and could impact the financial condition of the Companies. Construction Risks The Companies’ infrastructure build and expansion plans often require regulatory approval, including environmental permits, before commencing construction and completing projects. The Companies may not complete the facility construction, pipeline, conversion or other infrastructure projects that they commence, or they may complete projects on materially different terms, costs or timing than initially estimated or anticipated, and they may not be able to achieve the intended benefits of any such project, if completed. A number of large and small scale projects have been announced, including pipelines, electric transmission lines, facility expansions or renewed licensing, conversions and other infrastructure developments or construction. Additional projects may be considered in the future. The Companies compete for projects with companies of varying size and financial capabilities, including some that may have competitive advantages. Commencing construction on announced and future projects may require approvals from applicable state and federal agencies, and such approvals could include mitigation costs which may be material to the Companies. Projects may not be able to be completed on time or in accordance with our estimated costs as a result of weather conditions, delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory and other, including PJM, approvals, delays in obtaining key materials, labor difficulties, difficulties with partners or potential partners, concerns raised during stakeholder engagement, a decline in the credit strength of counterparties or vendors, inflation, or other factors beyond the Companies’ control. For example, Dominion Energy has been involved with projects which have experienced certain delays in obtaining and maintaining permits necessary for construction along with construction delays due to judicial actions which impacted the cost and schedule such as 39 the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project and ultimately led to its cancellation. Even if facility construction, pipeline, expansion, electric transmission line, conversion and other infrastructure projects are completed, the total costs of the projects may be higher than anticipated and the performance of the business of the Companies following completion of the projects may not meet expectations.  Start-up and operational issues can arise in connection with the commencement of commercial operations at our facilities. Such issues may include failure to meet specific operating parameters, which may require adjustments to meet or amend these operating parameters. Additionally, the Companies may not be able to timely and effectively integrate the projects into their operations and such integration may result in unforeseen operating difficulties or unanticipated costs. Further, regulators may disallow recovery of some of the costs of a project if they are deemed not to be prudently incurred. Any of these or other factors could adversely affect the Companies’ ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the facility construction, pipeline, electric transmission line, expansion, conversion and other infrastructure projects. The development and construction of the CVOW Commercial Project involves significant risks. The CVOW Commercial Project is a large-scale, complex project that will take several years to complete. Significant delays or cost increases, or an inability to recover certain project costs, could have an adverse effect on the Companies’ financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.  If the Companies are unable to complete the development and construction of the CVOW Commercial Project or decide in the future to delay or cancel the project, the Companies may not be able to recover all or a portion of their investment in the project and may incur substantial cancellation payments under existing contracts or other substantial costs associated with any such delay or cancellation. The Companies’ ability to complete the CVOW Commercial Project within the currently proposed timeline, or at all, and consistent with current cost estimates is subject to various risks and uncertainties, certain of which are beyond the Companies’ control.   The development and construction of the CVOW Commercial Project is dependent on the Companies’ ability to obtain and maintain various local, state and federal permits and other regulatory approvals, including Virginia Commission approval for rider recovery of project costs. In addition, the design and route of the project’s onshore electric transmission, network upgrades and other facilities remain subject to regulatory and PJM review and approval. Changes in the design and route of these onshore facilities, including an increase in amount of undergrounding, would likely increase project costs. Also, the CVOW Commercial Project may become the subject of litigation or other forms of intervention by third parties, including stakeholders or advocacy groups, that may impact the timing and receipt of permits or other regulatory approvals or otherwise delay or increase the cost of the project.   The Companies’ ability to invest the significant financial resources necessary for the CVOW Commercial Project is dependent on the Companies’ access to the financial markets in a timely and cost-effective manner. A decline in the Companies’ credit worthiness, an unfavorable market reputation of either the Companies or their industry or general market disruptions could adversely impact financing costs and increase the overall cost of the project. The development and construction of the CVOW Commercial Project is also dependent on the ability of certain key suppliers and contractors to timely satisfy their obligations under contracts entered into or expected to be entered into. Given the unique equipment and expertise required for this project, the Companies may not be able to remedy in a timely and cost-effective manner, if at all, any failure by one or more of these suppliers or contractors to timely satisfy their contractual obligations. Certain of the fixed price contracts for major offshore construction and equipment components are denominated in Euros and Danish kroner, including those which contain commodity indexing provisions linked to steel. Accordingly, to the extent the Companies are unable to, including from the inability to receive approval from the Virginia Commission, or elect not to, hedge their exposure to these currencies, adverse fluctuations in the applicable exchange rates would likely adversely affect the cost of the CVOW Commercial Project. Similarly, adverse fluctuations in the price of certain raw materials, including steel, would likely, to the extent not hedged by the Companies, adversely affect the overall costs incurred to develop and construct the project. The development and construction of the CVOW Commercial Project involves the use of new turbine technology and will take place in a marine environment, which presents unique challenges and will require the use of a specialized workforce and specialized equipment. In addition, the timely installation of the turbines is dependent on the completion and availability of a Jones Act compliant vessel currently under construction, and regulatory approval for Virginia Power to use an affiliate’s vessel. The timeline for development and construction of the CVOW Commercial Project may also be negatively impacted by severe weather events or marine wildlife, including migration patterns of endangered and protected species, both of which are outside of the control of the Companies and its contractors. Any significant delays in the project timeline, including from any of the factors discussed above, resulting in both the delay of commencement of construction to 2024 or later combined with a delay to the in-service date to 2028 or later may impact the ability of the Companies to recover the costs of the CVOW Commercial Project. The development, construction and commissioning of several large-scale infrastructure projects simultaneously involves significant execution risk.  To achieve Dominion Energy’s commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 and comply with the requirements of the VCEA, the Companies are currently simultaneously developing or constructing several electric generation projects, including Subsequent License Renewal projects at Surry and North Anna, the CVOW Commercial Project and various solar projects. Several of the Companies’ key projects are increasingly large-scale, complex and being constructed in constrained 40 geographic areas or in unfamiliar environments such as the marine environment for the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind projects. The advancement of the Companies’ ventures is also affected by the interventions, litigation or other activities of stakeholder and advocacy groups, some of which oppose natural gas-related and energy infrastructure projects. For example, certain stakeholder groups oppose solar farms due to the increasing quantities of land tracts required for these facilities. Given that these projects provide the foundation for the Companies’ strategic growth plan, if the Companies are unable to obtain or maintain the required regulatory and other, including PJM, approvals, develop the necessary technical expertise, allocate and coordinate sufficient resources, adhere to budgets and timelines, effectively handle public outreach efforts, or otherwise fail to successfully execute the projects, there could be an adverse impact to the Companies’ financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Failure to comply with regulatory approval conditions or an adverse ruling in any future litigation could adversely affect the Companies’ ability to execute their business plan. The Companies are dependent on their contractors for the successful and timely completion of large-scale infrastructure projects. The construction of such projects is expected to take several years, is typically confined within a limited geographic area or difficult environments and could be subject to delays, supply chain disruption, cost overruns, inflation, labor disputes or shortages and other factors that could cause the total cost of the project to exceed the anticipated amount and adversely affect the Companies’ financial performance and/or impair the Companies’ ability to execute the business plan for the project as scheduled. Further, an inability to obtain financing or otherwise provide liquidity for the projects on acceptable terms could negatively affect the Companies’ financial condition, cash flows, the projects’ anticipated financial results and/or impair the Companies’ ability to execute the business plan for the projects as scheduled. Operational Risks The Companies’ financial performance and condition can be affected by changes in the weather, including the effects of global climate change.  Fluctuations in weather can affect demand for the Companies’ services. For example, milder than normal weather can reduce demand for electricity and gas distribution services. In addition, severe weather or acts of nature, including hurricanes, winter storms, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters can stress systems, disrupt operation of the Companies’ facilities and cause service outages, production delays and property damage that require incurring additional expenses. Changes in weather conditions can result in reduced water levels or changes in water temperatures that could adversely affect operations at some of the Companies’ power stations. Furthermore, the Companies’ operations could be adversely affected and their physical plant placed at greater risk of damage should changes in global climate produce, among other possible conditions, unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, abnormal levels of precipitation and, for operations located on or near coastlines, a change in sea level or sea temperatures. Due to the location of the Companies’ electric utility service territories and a number of its other facilities in the eastern portions of the states of South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia which are frequently in the path of hurricanes, we experience the consequences of these weather events to a greater degree than many of our industry peers. Hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair the Companies’ operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information, damage the reputation of the Companies and otherwise have an adverse effect on the Companies’ business.  The Companies own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems. Further, the computer systems that run the Companies’ facilities are not completely isolated from external networks. There appears to be an increasing level of activity, sophistication and maturity of threat actors, in particular nation state actors, that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system and the U.S. gas transmission or distribution system. Such parties could view the Companies’ computer systems, software or networks as attractive targets for cyber attack. For example, malware has been designed to target software that runs the nation’s critical infrastructure such as power transmission grids and gas pipelines. In addition, the Companies’ businesses require that they and their vendors collect and maintain sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss. A successful cyber attack through third-party or insider action on the systems that control the Companies’ electric generation, electric transmission or distribution assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing the Companies from serving customers or collecting revenues. The breach of certain business systems could affect the Companies’ ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to the Companies’ reputation. In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data at the Companies or one of their vendors could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring. If a significant breach were to occur, the reputation of the Companies also could be adversely affected. While the Companies maintain property and casualty insurance, along with other contractual provisions, that may cover certain damage caused by potential cyber incidents, all damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available. For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could materially and adversely affect the Companies’ business, financial condition and results of operations. 41  The Companies’ operations are subject to operational hazards, equipment failures, supply chain disruptions and personnel issues which could negatively affect the Companies.  Operation of the Companies’ facilities involves risk, including the risk of potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure, fuel supply, pipeline integrity or transportation disruptions, accidents, labor disputes or work stoppages by employees, acts of terrorism or sabotage, construction delays or cost overruns, shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material and labor, operational restrictions resulting from environmental limitations and governmental interventions, changes to the environment and performance below expected levels. The Companies’ businesses are dependent upon sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, the failure of which could prevent them from accomplishing critical business functions. Because the Companies’ transmission facilities, pipelines and other facilities are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of their facilities and pipelines could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties. Operation of the Companies’ facilities below expected capacity levels could result in lost revenues and increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs. Unplanned outages of the Companies’ facilities and extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of the Companies’ business. Unplanned outages typically increase the Companies’ operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce their revenues as a result of selling less output or may require the Companies to incur significant costs as a result of operating higher cost units or obtaining replacement output from third parties in the open market to satisfy forward energy and capacity or other contractual obligations. Moreover, if the Companies are unable to perform their contractual obligations, penalties or liability for damages could result. In addition, there are many risks associated with the Companies’ principal operations and the transportation and storage of natural gas  including nuclear accidents, fires, explosions, uncontrolled release of natural gas and other environmental hazards, pole strikes, electric contact cases, the collision of third party equipment with pipelines and avian and other wildlife impacts. Such incidents could result in loss of human life or injuries among employees, customers or the public in general, environmental pollution, damage or destruction of facilities or business interruptions and associated public or employee safety impacts, loss of revenues, increased liabilities, heightened regulatory scrutiny and reputational risk. Further, the location of natural gas pipelines and associated distribution facilities, or electric generation, transmission, substations and distribution facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. The Companies’ financial results can be adversely affected by various factors driving supply and demand for electricity and gas and related services. Technological advances required by federal laws mandate new levels of energy efficiency in end-use devices, including lighting, furnaces and electric heat pumps and could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption. Additionally, certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by a fixed date. Consumer demand for our services may also be impacted by any price increases, including those driven by factors beyond our control such as inflation or increased prices in natural gas.  Further, Virginia Power’s business model is premised upon the cost efficiency of the production, transmission and distribution of large-scale centralized utility generation. However, advances in distributed generation technologies, such as solar cells, gas microturbines, battery storage and fuel cells, may make these alternative generation methods competitive with large-scale utility generation, and change how customers acquire or use our services. The widescale implementation of alternative generation methods could negatively impact the reliability of the Companies’ electric grid and/or result in significant costs to enhance the grid. Virginia Power has an exclusive franchise to serve retail electric customers in Virginia. However, Virginia’s Retail Access Statutes allow certain electric generation customers exceptions to this franchise. As market conditions change, Virginia Power’s customers may further pursue exceptions and Virginia Power’s exclusive franchise may erode. Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due to customer adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, distributed generation, regional economic conditions, or the impact of additional compliance obligations, unless substantially offset through regulatory cost allocations, could adversely impact the value of the Companies’ business activities. The Companies may be materially adversely affected by negative publicity or the inability of Dominion Energy to meet its stated commitments.  From time to time, political and public sentiment may result in a significant amount of adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting the Companies. Any failure by Dominion Energy to realize its commitments to achieve net zero carbon and methane emissions by 2050, increase workforce diversity, enhance the customer experience or other long-term goals could lead to adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting the Companies. The ability to comply with some or all of Dominion Energy’s voluntary commitments may be outside of its control. For example, Dominion Energy is dependent on the actions of third parties to meet the expanded commitment regarding Scope 2 emissions and Scope 3 emissions. If downstream customers or upstream suppliers do not sufficiently reduce their GHG emissions, Dominion Energy may not achieve its net zero emissions goal. In addition, while the Atlantic Coast Pipeline project was cancelled in July 2020 and several of the legal proceedings and governmental investigations relating to the abandonment of the NND Project have been resolved, there is a risk that lingering negative publicity may continue.  Adverse press coverage and other adverse statements, whether or not driven by political or public sentiment, may also result in investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in legal claims as well as adverse outcomes. 42  Addressing any adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny or enforcement or other legal proceedings is time consuming and expensive and, regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made, can have a negative impact on the reputation of the Companies, on the morale and performance of their employees and on their relationships with their respective regulators, customers and commercial counterparties. It may also have a negative impact on the Companies’ ability to take timely advantage of various business and market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects of negative publicity, and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may have a material adverse effect on the Companies’ business, financial condition and results of operations. Dominion Energy’s nonregulated generation business operates in a challenging market, which could adversely affect its results of operations and future growth.  The success of Dominion Energy’s contracted generation business depends upon favorable market conditions including the ability to sell power at prices sufficient to cover its operating costs. Dominion Energy operates in active wholesale markets that expose it to price volatility for electricity and nuclear fuel as well as the credit risk of counterparties. Dominion Energy attempts to manage its price risk by entering into long-term power purchase agreements with customers as well as hedging transactions, including short-term and long-term fixed price sales and purchase contracts. The failure of Dominion Energy to maintain, renew or replace its existing long-term contracts on similar terms or with counterparties with similar credit profiles could result in a loss of revenue and/or decreased earnings and cash flows for Dominion Energy. In these wholesale markets, the spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the cost of supplying the next unit of electricity to the market during that hour. In many cases, the next unit of electricity supplied would be provided by generating stations that consume fossil fuels, primarily natural gas. Consequently, the open market wholesale price for electricity generally reflects the cost of natural gas plus the cost to convert the fuel to electricity. Therefore, changes in the price of natural gas generally affect the open market wholesale price of electricity. To the extent Dominion Energy does not enter into long-term power purchase agreements or otherwise effectively hedge its output, these changes in market prices could adversely affect its financial results. Dominion Energy purchases nuclear fuel primarily under long-term contracts. Dominion Energy is exposed to nuclear fuel cost volatility for the portion of its nuclear fuel obtained through short-term contracts or on the spot market, including as a result of market supply shortages. Nuclear fuel prices can be volatile and the price that can be obtained for power produced may not change at the same rate as nuclear fuel costs, thus adversely impacting Dominion Energy’s financial results. In addition, in the event that any of the contracted generation facilities experience a forced outage, Dominion Energy may not receive the level of revenue it anticipated. Dominion Energy conducts certain operations through partnership arrangements involving third-party investors which may limit Dominion Energy’s operational flexibility or result in an adverse impact on its financial results.  Certain of Dominion Energy’s operations are conducted through entities subject to partnership arrangements under which Dominion Energy has significant influence but does not control the operations of such entities or in which Dominion Energy’s control over such entities may be subject to certain rights of third-party investors. Accordingly, while Dominion Energy may have a certain level of control or influence over these entities, it may not have unilateral, or any, control over the day-to-day operations of these entities or over decisions that may have a material financial impact on the partnership participants, including Dominion Energy. In each case such partnership arrangements operate in accordance with their respective governance documents, and Dominion Energy is dependent upon third parties satisfying their respective obligations, including, as applicable, funding of their required share of capital expenditures. Such third-party investors have their own interests and objectives which may differ from those of Dominion Energy and, accordingly, disputes may arise amongst the owners of such partnership arrangements that may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses. For example, Dominion Energy has a noncontrolling 50% interest in Cove Point following the sale of a 25% controlling interest to BHE in November 2020. This controlling interest allows BHE to make decisions affecting Cove Point’s ability to retain its long-term contracts.  Cove Point is a party to certain contracts that allow a regulated service provider and a customer to mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a “negotiated rate” which may be above or below the FERC regulated, cost-based recourse rate for that service. These “negotiated rate” contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased costs which could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services. Any shortfall of revenue as a result of these “negotiated rate” contracts could decrease Cove Point’s earnings and cash flows.  The inability to maintain or renew such contracts on favorable terms may have a material impact to Dominion Energy’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  Dominion Energy is also dependent upon BHE for managing counterparty credit risk relating to Cove Point’s terminal services agreements for its liquefied natural gas export/liquefaction facility. While the counterparties’ obligations are supported by parental guarantees and letters of credit, there is no assurance that such credit support would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations in the event of a counterparty default. In addition, if a controversy arises under either terminal services agreement resulting in a judgment in Cove Point’s favor, Cove Point may need to seek to enforce a final U.S. court judgment in a foreign tribunal, which could involve a lengthy process. Accordingly, there is no assurance that BHE may pursue remedies in the event of default in the same manner as Dominion Energy would if it had unilateral control over such decisions. War, acts and threats of terrorism, intentional acts and other significant events could adversely affect the Companies’ operations.  The Companies cannot predict the impact that any future terrorist attacks or retaliatory military or other action may have on the energy industry in general or on the Companies’ businesses in particular. Any such future attacks or retaliatory action may adversely affect the Companies’ operations in a variety of ways, including by disrupting the power, fuel and other markets in which 43 the Companies operate or requiring the implementation of additional, more costly security guidelines and measures. The Companies’ infrastructure facilities, including nuclear facilities and projects under construction, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or other physical attack. Any physical compromise of the Companies’ facilities could adversely affect the Companies’ ability to generate, purchase, transmit or distribute electricity, distribute natural gas or otherwise operate their respective facilities in the most efficient manner or at all. In addition, the amount and scope of insurance coverage maintained against losses resulting from any such attack may not be sufficient to cover such losses or otherwise adequately compensate for any business disruptions that could result. Instability in financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, intentional acts, pandemic, credit crises, recession or other factors could result in a significant decline in the U.S. economy and/or increase the cost or limit the availability of insurance or adversely impact the Companies’ ability to access capital on acceptable terms. Failure to attract and retain key executive officers and an appropriately qualified workforce could have an adverse effect on the Companies’ operations.  The Companies’ business strategy is dependent on their ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees. The Companies’ key executive officers are the CEO, CFO, COO and presidents and those responsible for financial, operational, legal, regulatory, accounting, information technology and cybersecurity functions. Competition for skilled management employees in these areas of the Companies’ business operations is high. Certain events, such as an aging workforce, mismatch of skill set, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge base and the length of time required for skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employees, or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the Companies’ business. In addition, certain specialized knowledge is required of the Companies’ technical employees for construction and operation of transmission, generation and distribution assets. The Companies’ inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect their business and future operating results. Nuclear Generation Risks The Companies have substantial ownership interests in and operate nuclear generating units; as a result, each may incur substantial costs and liabilities.  The Companies’ nuclear facilities are subject to operational, environmental, health and financial risks such as the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel, the ability to dispose of such spent nuclear fuel, the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance available, potential operational liabilities and extended outages, the costs of replacement power, the costs of maintenance and the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks. The Companies maintain decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage to minimize the financial exposure to these risks; however, it is possible that future decommissioning costs could exceed amounts in the decommissioning trusts and/or damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. If the Companies’ decommissioning trust funds are insufficient, and they are not allowed to recover the additional costs incurred through insurance or regulatory mechanisms, their results of operations could be negatively impacted. The Companies’ nuclear facilities are also subject to complex government regulation which could negatively impact their results of operations. The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generating facilities. In the event of noncompliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines, set license conditions, shut down a nuclear unit, or take some combination of these actions, depending on its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require the Companies to make substantial expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, although the Companies have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at their plants, if an incident did occur, it could materially and adversely affect their results of operations and/or financial condition. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world, such as the nuclear events in Japan in 2011, could cause the NRC to adopt increased safety regulations or otherwise limit or restrict the operation or licensing of domestic nuclear units. Financial, Economic and Market Risks Changing rating agency requirements could negatively affect the Companies’ growth and business strategy.  In order to maintain appropriate credit ratings to obtain needed credit at a reasonable cost in light of existing or future rating agency requirements, the Companies may find it necessary to take steps or change their business plans in ways that may adversely affect their growth and earnings. A reduction in the Companies’ credit ratings could result in an increase in borrowing costs, loss of access to certain markets, or both, thus adversely affecting operating results and could require the Companies to post additional collateral in connection with some of its price risk management activities. An inability to access financial markets and, in the case of Dominion Energy, obtain cash from subsidiaries could adversely affect the execution of the Companies’ business plans.  The Companies rely on access to short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as significant sources of funding and liquidity for business plans with increasing capital expenditure needs, 44 normal working capital and collateral requirements related to hedges of future sales and purchases of energy-related commodities. Deterioration in the Companies’ creditworthiness, as evaluated by credit rating agencies or otherwise, or declines in market reputation either for the Companies or their industry in general, or general financial market disruptions outside of the Companies’ control could increase their cost of borrowing or restrict their ability to access one or more financial markets. Market disruptions could stem from general market disruption due to general credit market or political events, the planned phase out of LIBOR by the end of 2023 or the reform or replacement of other benchmark rates, the failure of financial institutions on which the Companies rely or the bankruptcy of an unrelated company. Increased costs and restrictions on the Companies’ ability to access financial markets may be severe enough to affect their ability to execute their business plans as scheduled. Dominion Energy is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries. Accordingly, Dominion Energy’s ability to execute its business plan is further subject to the earnings and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or advance or repay funds to it, which may, from time to time, be subject to certain contractual restrictions or restrictions imposed by regulators. Market performance, interest rates and other changes may decrease the value of the Companies’ decommissioning trust funds and Dominion Energy’s benefit plan assets or increase Dominion Energy’s liabilities, which could then require significant additional funding.  The performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trusts to satisfy future obligations to decommission the Companies’ nuclear plants and under Dominion Energy’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The Companies have significant obligations in these areas and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below expected return rates. With respect to decommissioning trust funds, a decline in the market value of these assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations to decommission the Companies’ nuclear plants or require additional NRC-approved funding assurance. A decline in the market value of the assets held in trusts to satisfy future obligations under Dominion Energy’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans may increase the funding requirements under such plans. Additionally, changes in interest rates will affect the liabilities under Dominion Energy’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in mortality assumptions, may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. If the decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets are negatively impacted by market fluctuations or other factors, the Companies’ results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows could be negatively affected. The use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses and liquidity constraints.  The Companies use derivative instruments, including futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs, to manage commodity, interest rate and/or foreign currency exchange rate risks. The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted into law in July 2010 in an effort to improve regulation of financial markets. The CEA, as amended by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, requires certain over-the-counter derivatives, or swaps, to be cleared through a derivatives clearing organization and, if the swap is subject to a clearing requirement, to be executed on a designated contract market or swap execution facility. Non-financial entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end users, may elect the end-user exception to the CEA’s clearing requirements. The Companies have elected to exempt their swaps from the CEA’s clearing requirements. If, as a result of changes to the rulemaking process, the Companies’ derivative activities are not exempted from the clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, the Companies could be subject to higher costs due to decreased market liquidity or increased margin payments. In addition, the Companies’ swap dealer counterparties may attempt to pass-through additional trading costs in connection with changes to or the elimination of rulemaking that implements Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. Future impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets or long-lived assets may have a material adverse effect on the Companies’ results.  Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Other intangible assets and long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that an asset’s carrying value may not be recoverable. If Dominion Energy’s goodwill or the Companies’ other intangible assets or long-lived assets are in the future determined to be impaired, the applicable Company would be required during the period in which the impairment is determined to record a noncash charge to earnings that may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results. Exposure to counterparty performance may adversely affect the Companies’ financial results of operations.  The Companies are exposed to credit risks of their counterparties and the risk that one or more counterparties may fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations, including but not limited to payment for services. Some of Dominion Energy’s operations are conducted through partnership arrangements, as noted above. Counterparties could fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations 45 for a number of reasons, including the effect of regulations on their operations. Defaults or failure to perform by customers, suppliers, contractors, joint venture partners, financial institutions or other third parties may adversely affect the Companies’ financial results. Public health crises and epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19, could adversely affect the Companies’ business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and/or cash flows.  The effects of the continued outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government responses could include extended disruptions to supply chains and capital markets, reduced labor availability and productivity and a prolonged reduction in economic activity. The effects could also have a variety of adverse impacts on the Companies, including reduced demand for energy, particularly from commercial and industrial customers, impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets and diminished ability of the Companies to access funds from financial institutions and capital markets.  There remains uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. Such restrictions may cause operational interruptions and delays in construction projects, which, in the case of renewable energy projects, could delay the expected in-service dates of these projects and financial statement impact of the investment tax credits associated with these projects. For the duration of the outbreak of COVID-19, voluntary suspension, or potential legislative or government action, such as legislation enacted in Virginia in November 2020, may limit the Companies’ ability to collect on overdue accounts or disconnect services for non-payment, which may cause a decrease in the Companies’ results of operations and cash flows.  "
4,D,DOMINION ENERGY INC,2021-02-25,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
The Companies’ businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyond their control. A number of these factors have been identified below. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement or projection contained in this report, see Forward-Looking Statements in Item 7. MD&A. Regulatory, Legislative and Legal Risks The rates of the Companies’ principal electric transmission, distribution and generation operations and gas distribution operations are subject to regulatory review.  Revenue provided by the Companies’ electric transmission, distribution and generation operations and by gas distribution operations is based primarily on rates approved by state and federal regulatory agencies. The profitability of the Companies’ businesses is dependent on their ability, through the rates that they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on their capital investment. At the federal level, the Companies’ wholesale rates for electric transmission service are regulated by FERC. Rates for electric transmission services are updated annually according to a FERC-approved formula rate mechanism, and may be subject to additional prospective adjustments and retroactive corrections. A failure by the Companies to support these rates could result in rate decreases from current rate levels, which could adversely affect the Companies’ results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. At the state level, Virginia Power’s retail base rates, terms and conditions for generation and distribution services to customers in Virginia are reviewed by the Virginia Commission in a proceeding that involves the determination of Virginia Power’s actual earned ROE during a historic test period, and the determination of Virginia Power’s authorized ROE prospectively. The GTSA reinstated triennial reviews commencing with the 2021 Triennial Review. Under certain circumstances described in the Regulation Act, Virginia Power may be required to refund a portion of its earnings to customers through a refund process and to reduce its rates. Additionally, Virginia Power’s ability to utilize CCROs for certain qualifying projects as provided for in the GTSA may be limited if the Virginia Commission does not approve such projects. Virginia Power makes assessments throughout the review period and will record a regulatory liability for refunds and/or CCRO benefits to customers in any period it is determined probable, which could be material to the Companies’ results of operations in the period recognized and to cash flows on completion of any triennial review.  In states other than Virginia, the Companies’ retail electric base rates for generation and distribution services to customers are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to the statutes, rules and procedures of such states. Dominion Energy’s rates for gas distribution to retail customers are similarly regulated at the state level. If retail electric or gas earnings exceed the returns established by state utility commissions, retail electric rates or gas rates may be subject to review and possible reduction, which may decrease the Companies’ future earnings. Additionally, if any state utility commission does not allow recovery through base rates, on a timely basis, of costs incurred in providing service, the Company’s future earnings could be negatively impacted. Under certain circumstances, state utility regulators may impose a moratorium on increases to retail base rates for a specified period of time, which could delay recovery of costs incurred in providing service. Additionally, governmental officials, stakeholders and advocacy groups may challenge any of these regulatory reviews. Such challenges may lengthen the time, complexity and costs associated with such regulatory reviews. The Companies’ generation business may be negatively affected by possible FERC actions that could change market design in the wholesale markets or affect pricing rules or revenue calculations in the RTO markets.  The Companies’ generation stations operating in RTO markets sell capacity, energy and ancillary services into wholesale electricity markets regulated by FERC. The wholesale markets allow these generation stations to take advantage of market price opportunities, but also expose them to market risk. Properly functioning competitive wholesale markets depend upon FERC’s continuation of clearly identified market rules. From time to time FERC may investigate and authorize RTOs to make changes in market design. FERC also periodically reviews the Companies’ authority to sell at market-based rates. Material changes by FERC to the design of the wholesale markets or its interpretation of market rules, the Companies’ authority to sell power at market-based rates, or changes to pricing rules or rules involving revenue calculations, could adversely impact the future results of the Companies’ generation business. For example, in December 2019, FERC issued an order on PJM’s Minimum Offer Price Rule proposals finding the PJM tariff unjust and unreasonable and directed PJM to expand the Minimum Offer Price Rule to all existing and new generation resources benefitting from a state subsidy to address the effects of state subsidies on new and existing resources on the PJM capacity market. The expanded Minimum Offer Price Rule will set a floor price on new and existing renewable and non-renewable state subsidized resources that do not seek a FERC exemption, increasing their risk of failing to clear the capacity auction and not obtaining a capacity payment and obligation. In addition, changes to the interpretation and application of FERC’s market manipulation rules may occur from time to time. A failure to comply with these market manipulation rules could lead to civil and criminal penalties. 36  The Companies are subject to complex governmental regulation, including tax regulation, that could adversely affect their results of operations and subject the Companies to monetary penalties.  The Companies’ operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation and require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies. Such laws and regulations govern the terms and conditions of the services we offer, our relationships with affiliates, protection of our critical electric infrastructure assets and pipeline safety, among other matters. These operations are also subject to legislation governing taxation at the federal, state and local level. They must also comply with environmental legislation and associated regulations. Management believes that the necessary approvals have been obtained for existing operations and that the businesses are conducted in accordance with applicable laws. The Companies’ businesses are subject to regulatory regimes which could result in substantial monetary penalties if any of the Companies is found not to be in compliance, including mandatory reliability standards and interaction in the wholesale markets. New laws or regulations, the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations, changes in enforcement practices of regulators, or penalties imposed for non-compliance with existing laws or regulations may result in substantial additional expense. Recent legislative and regulatory changes that are impacting the Companies include the VCEA, the 2017 Tax Reform Act and tariffs imposed on imported solar panels by the U.S. government in 2018. Through the SCANA Combination, Dominion Energy acquired SCANA and DESC which have been and continue to be subject to numerous legal proceedings and ongoing governmental investigations and examinations.  While a significant portion of the federal and state legal proceedings and governmental investigations have been settled, SCANA and DESC remain defendants in multiple lawsuits and investigations relating to the decision to abandon construction at the NND Project. Among other things, the lawsuits and investigations allege misrepresentation, failure to properly manage the NND Project, unfair trade practices and violation of anti-trust laws. Additionally, pursuant to the SCANA Merger Agreement and applicable indemnification agreements, SCANA is indemnifying former directors and officers of SCANA and DESC who are defendants in federal and state legal proceedings relating to the decision to abandon construction at the NND Project and the subsequent SCANA Combination. Among other things, the lawsuits allege breaches of various fiduciary duties. The outcome of these legal proceedings, investigations and examinations, including settlements, is uncertain and may adversely affect Dominion Energy’s financial condition or results of operation.Environmental Risks Compliance with federal and/or state requirements imposing limitations on GHG emissions or efficiency improvements, as well as Dominion Energy’s commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, may result in significant compliance costs, could result in certain of the Companies’ existing electric generation units being uneconomical to maintain or operate and may depend upon technological advancements which may be beyond the Companies’ control.  Virginia has adopted the VCEA which establishes renewable energy and CO2 reduction targets for Virginia Power’s generation fleet and grid operations, including the requirement that 100% of Virginia Power’s electricity come from zero-carbon generation by the end of 2045.  The legislation mandates the development of 16,100 MW of solar or onshore wind capacity by the end of 2035, 5,200 MW of offshore wind capacity before 2035, and 2,700 MW of energy storage by the end of 2035.  The VCEA also directs Virginia Power to participate in a program consistent with RGGI, requiring the purchase of carbon credits to offset emissions from Virginia Power’s generating fleet within the state.  Cost recovery for these initiatives will require approval by the Virginia Commission which may be denied or materially altered to the detriment of the Companies.  In addition, permitting and other project execution challenges may hinder Virginia Power’s ability to meet the requirements of the VCEA.  The Companies could face similar risks if there is further legislation at the federal and/or state level mandating additional limitations on GHG emissions or requiring additional efficiency improvements.    In February 2020, Dominion Energy announced its commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. To meet this commitment, the Companies expect to construct new electric generation facilities, including renewable facilities such as wind and solar, and to seek the extension of operating licenses for the Companies’ nuclear generation facilities. The Companies also need to depend on technological improvements not currently in commercial development. Additionally, actions taken in furtherance of Dominion Energy’s net zero commitment may impact existing generation facilities, including as a result of fuel switching and/or the retirement of high-emitting generation facilities and their potential replacement with lower-emitting generation facilities. Further, the ability to realize this commitment will require the Companies to be able to obtain significant financing. These efforts will require approvals from various regulatory bodies for the siting and construction of such new facilities and a determination by the applicable state commissions that costs related to the construction are prudent. Given these and other uncertainties associated with the implementation of Dominion Energy’s net zero commitment, the Companies cannot estimate the aggregate effect of future actions taken in furtherance of this commitment on their results of operations or financial condition or on their customers. However, such actions could render additional existing generation facilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect the Companies’ results of operations, financial performance or liquidity. There are also potential impacts on Dominion Energy’s natural gas business from its net zero emissions commitment as well as federal or state GHG regulations which may require further GHG emission reductions from the natural gas sector which, in addition to 37 resulting in increased costs, could affect demand for natural gas. Additionally, GHG requirements could result in increased demand for energy conservation and renewable products, which could impact the natural gas business. Dominion Energy’s renewable natural gas projects, expected to be a key component of Dominion Energy’s environmental strategy, require approvals from various regulatory bodies for the siting and construction of such facilities. The Companies’ operations and construction activities are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations which impose significant compliance costs on the Companies.  The Companies’ operations and construction activities are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources, and health and safety. Compliance with these legal requirements requires the Companies to commit significant capital toward permitting, emission fees, environmental monitoring, installation and operation of environmental control equipment and purchase of allowances and/or offsets. Additionally, the Companies could be responsible for expenses relating to remediation and containment obligations, including at sites where they have been identified by a regulatory agency as a potentially responsible party. Expenditures relating to environmental compliance have been significant in the past, and the Companies expect that they will remain significant in the future. Certain facilities have become uneconomical to operate and have been shut down, converted to new fuel types or sold. These types of events could occur again in the future. We expect that existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and/or new laws may be adopted including regulation of GHG emissions which could have an impact on the Companies’ business (risks relating to regulation of GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units are discussed in more detail below). In addition, further regulation of air quality and GHG emissions under the CAA may be imposed on the natural gas sector. The Companies are also subject to federal water and waste regulations, including regulations concerning cooling water intake structures, coal combustion by-product handling and disposal practices, wastewater discharges from steam electric generating stations, management and disposal of hydraulic fracturing fluids and the potential further regulation of polychlorinated biphenyls. Compliance costs cannot be estimated with certainty due to the inability to predict the requirements and timing of implementation of any new environmental rules or regulations. Other factors which affect the ability to predict future environmental expenditures with certainty include the difficulty in estimating clean-up costs and quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liabilities on all responsible parties. However, such expenditures, if material, could make the Companies’ facilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect the Companies’ results of operations, financial performance or liquidity. The Companies are subject to risks associated with the disposal and storage of coal ash.  The Companies historically produced and continue to produce coal ash, or CCRs, as a by-product of their coal-fired generation operations. The ash is stored and managed in impoundments (ash ponds) and landfills located at 11 different facilities, eight of which are at Virginia Power. The EPA has issued regulations concerning the management and storage of CCRs, which Virginia has adopted. These CCR regulations require the Companies to make additional capital expenditures and increase operating and maintenance expenses. In addition, the Companies will incur expenses and other costs associated with closing, corrective action and ongoing monitoring of certain ash ponds. The Companies also may face litigation concerning their coal ash facilities. Further, while the Companies operate their ash ponds and landfills in compliance with applicable state safety regulations, a release of coal ash with a significant environmental impact could result in remediation costs, civil and/or criminal penalties, claims, litigation, increased regulation and compliance costs, and reputational damage, and could impact the financial condition of the Companies. Construction Risks The Companies’ infrastructure build and expansion plans often require regulatory approval, including environmental permits, before commencing construction and completing projects. The Companies may not complete the facility construction, pipeline, conversion or other infrastructure projects that they commence, or they may complete projects on materially different terms, costs or timing than initially estimated or anticipated, and they may not be able to achieve the intended benefits of any such project, if completed. A number of large and small scale projects have been announced, including pipelines, electric transmission lines, facility expansions or renewed licensing, conversions and other infrastructure developments or construction. Additional projects may be considered in the future. The Companies compete for projects with companies of varying size and financial capabilities, including some that may have competitive advantages. Commencing construction on announced and future projects may require approvals from applicable state and federal agencies, and such approvals could include mitigation costs which may be material to the Companies. Projects may not be able to be completed on time or in accordance with our estimated costs as a result of weather conditions, delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory approvals, delays in obtaining key materials, labor difficulties, difficulties with partners or potential partners, a decline in the credit strength of counterparties or vendors, or other factors beyond the Companies’ control. For example, Dominion Energy has been involved with projects which have experienced certain 38 delays in obtaining and maintaining permits necessary for construction along with construction delays due to judicial actions which impacted the cost and schedule such as the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project and ultimately led to its cancellation. Even if facility construction, pipeline, expansion, electric transmission line, conversion and other infrastructure projects are completed, the total costs of the projects may be higher than anticipated and the performance of the business of the Companies following completion of the projects may not meet expectations.  Start-up and operational issues can arise in connection with the commencement of commercial operations at our facilities. Such issues may include failure to meet specific operating parameters, which may require adjustments to meet or amend these operating parameters. Additionally, the Companies may not be able to timely and effectively integrate the projects into their operations and such integration may result in unforeseen operating difficulties or unanticipated costs. Further, regulators may disallow recovery of some of the costs of a project if they are deemed not to be prudently incurred. Any of these or other factors could adversely affect the Companies’ ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the facility construction, pipeline, electric transmission line, expansion, conversion and other infrastructure projects. The development, construction and commissioning of several large-scale infrastructure projects simultaneously involves significant execution risk.  To achieve Dominion Energy’s commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 and comply with the requirements of the VCEA, the Companies are currently simultaneously developing or constructing several electric generation projects, including Subsequent License Renewal projects at Surry and North Anna, the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind projects and various solar projects. Several of the Companies’ key projects are increasingly large-scale, complex and being constructed in constrained geographic areas or in unfamiliar environments such as the marine environment for the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind projects. The advancement of the Companies’ ventures is also affected by the interventions, litigation or other activities of stakeholder and advocacy groups, some of which oppose natural gas-related and energy infrastructure projects. For example, certain stakeholder groups oppose solar farms due to the increasing quantities of land tracts required for these facilities. Given that these projects provide the foundation for the Companies’ strategic growth plan, if the Companies are unable to obtain or maintain the required approvals, develop the necessary technical expertise, allocate and coordinate sufficient resources, adhere to budgets and timelines, effectively handle public outreach efforts, or otherwise fail to successfully execute the projects, there could be an adverse impact to the Companies’ financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Failure to comply with regulatory approval conditions or an adverse ruling in any future litigation could adversely affect the Companies’ ability to execute their business plan. The Companies are dependent on their contractors for the successful and timely completion of large-scale infrastructure projects. The construction of such projects is expected to take several years, is typically confined within a limited geographic area or difficult environments and could be subject to delays, cost overruns, labor disputes and other factors that could cause the total cost of the project to exceed the anticipated amount and adversely affect the Companies’ financial performance and/or impair the Companies’ ability to execute the business plan for the project as scheduled. Further, an inability to obtain financing or otherwise provide liquidity for the projects on acceptable terms could negatively affect the Companies’ financial condition, cash flows, the projects’ anticipated financial results and/or impair the Companies’ ability to execute the business plan for the projects as scheduled. Operational Risks The Companies’ financial performance and condition can be affected by changes in the weather, including the effects of global climate change.  Fluctuations in weather can affect demand for the Companies’ services. For example, milder than normal weather can reduce demand for electricity and gas distribution services. In addition, severe weather or acts of nature, including hurricanes, winter storms, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters can stress systems, disrupt operation of the Companies’ facilities and cause service outages, production delays and property damage that require incurring additional expenses. Changes in weather conditions can result in reduced water levels or changes in water temperatures that could adversely affect operations at some of the Companies’ power stations. Furthermore, the Companies’ operations could be adversely affected and their physical plant placed at greater risk of damage should changes in global climate produce, among other possible conditions, unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, abnormal levels of precipitation and, for operations located on or near coastlines, a change in sea level or sea temperatures. Due to the location of the Companies’ electric utility service territories and a number of its other facilities in the eastern portions of the states of South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia which are frequently in the path of hurricanes, we experience the consequences of these weather events to a greater degree than many of our industry peers. The Companies’ operations are subject to operational hazards, equipment failures, supply chain disruptions and personnel issues which could negatively affect the Companies.  Operation of the Companies’ facilities involves risk, including the risk of potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure, fuel supply, pipeline integrity or transportation disruptions, accidents, labor disputes or work stoppages by employees, acts of terrorism or sabotage, construction delays or cost 39 overruns, shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material and labor, operational restrictions resulting from environmental limitations and governmental interventions, changes to the environment and performance below expected levels. The Companies’ businesses are dependent upon sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, the failure of which could prevent them from accomplishing critical business functions. Because the Companies’ transmission facilities, pipelines and other facilities are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of their facilities and pipelines could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties. Operation of the Companies’ facilities below expected capacity levels could result in lost revenues and increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs. Unplanned outages of the Companies’ facilities and extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of the Companies’ business. Unplanned outages typically increase the Companies’ operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce their revenues as a result of selling less output or may require the Companies to incur significant costs as a result of operating higher cost units or obtaining replacement output from third parties in the open market to satisfy forward energy and capacity or other contractual obligations. Moreover, if the Companies are unable to perform their contractual obligations, penalties or liability for damages could result. In addition, there are many risks associated with the Companies’ principal operations and the transportation and storage of natural gas  including nuclear accidents, fires, explosions, uncontrolled release of natural gas and other environmental hazards, pole strikes, electric contact cases, the collision of third party equipment with pipelines and avian and other wildlife impacts. Such incidents could result in loss of human life or injuries among employees, customers or the public in general, environmental pollution, damage or destruction of facilities or business interruptions and associated public or employee safety impacts, loss of revenues, increased liabilities, heightened regulatory scrutiny and reputational risk. Further, the location of natural gas pipelines and associated distribution facilities, or electric generation, transmission, substations and distribution facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. The Companies’ financial results can be adversely affected by various factors driving supply and demand for electricity and gas and related services. Technological advances required by federal laws mandate new levels of energy efficiency in end-use devices, including lighting, furnaces and electric heat pumps and could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption. Additionally, certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by a fixed date. Further, Virginia Power’s business model is premised upon the cost efficiency of the production, transmission and distribution of large-scale centralized utility generation. However, advances in distributed generation technologies, such as solar cells, gas microturbines, battery storage and fuel cells, may make these alternative generation methods competitive with large-scale utility generation, and change how customers acquire or use our services. Virginia Power has an exclusive franchise to serve retail electric customers in Virginia. However, Virginia’s Retail Access Statutes allow certain electric generation customers exceptions to this franchise. As market conditions change, Virginia Power’s customers may further pursue exceptions and Virginia Power’s exclusive franchise may erode. Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due to customer adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, distributed generation, regional economic conditions, or the impact of additional compliance obligations, unless substantially offset through regulatory cost allocations, could adversely impact the value of the Companies’ business activities. The Companies may be materially adversely affected by negative publicity.  From time to time, political and public sentiment in connection with significant transactions and infrastructure projects, such as the SCANA Merger and the abandonment of the NND Project, may result in a significant amount of adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting the Companies. While the Atlantic Coast Pipeline project was cancelled in July 2020 and several of the legal proceedings and governmental investigations relating to the abandonment of the NND Project have been resolved, there is a risk that lingering negative publicity may continue.  Additionally, any failure by the Companies to realize voluntary targets set with respect to the reduction of GHG emissions or other long-term goals could lead to adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting the Companies. Adverse press coverage and other adverse statements, whether or not driven by political or public sentiment, may also result in investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in legal claims. Addressing any adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny or enforcement or other legal proceedings is time consuming and expensive and, regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made, can have a negative impact on the reputation of the Companies, on the morale and performance of their employees and on their relationships with their respective regulators, customers and commercial counterparties. It may also have a negative impact on the Companies’ ability to take timely advantage of various business and market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects of negative publicity, and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may have a material adverse effect on the Companies’ business, financial condition and results of operations. Dominion Energy’s nonregulated generation business operates in a challenging market, which could adversely affect its results of operations and future growth.  The success of Dominion Energy’s contracted generation business depends upon favorable market 40 conditions including the ability to sell power at prices sufficient to cover its operating costs. Dominion Energy operates in active wholesale markets that expose it to price volatility for electricity and nuclear fuel as well as the credit risk of counterparties. Dominion Energy attempts to manage its price risk by entering into long-term power purchase agreements with customers as well as hedging transactions, including short-term and long-term fixed price sales and purchase contracts. The failure of Dominion Energy to maintain, renew or replace its existing long-term contracts on similar terms or with counterparties with similar credit profiles could result in a loss of revenue and/or decreased earnings and cash flows for Dominion Energy. In these wholesale markets, the spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the cost of supplying the next unit of electricity to the market during that hour. In many cases, the next unit of electricity supplied would be provided by generating stations that consume fossil fuels, primarily natural gas. Consequently, the open market wholesale price for electricity generally reflects the cost of natural gas plus the cost to convert the fuel to electricity. Therefore, changes in the price of natural gas generally affect the open market wholesale price of electricity. To the extent Dominion Energy does not enter into long-term power purchase agreements or otherwise effectively hedge its output, these changes in market prices could adversely affect its financial results. Dominion Energy purchases nuclear fuel primarily under long-term contracts. Dominion Energy is exposed to nuclear fuel cost volatility for the portion of its nuclear fuel obtained through short-term contracts or on the spot market, including as a result of market supply shortages. Nuclear fuel prices can be volatile and the price that can be obtained for power produced may not change at the same rate as nuclear fuel costs, thus adversely impacting Dominion Energy’s financial results. In addition, in the event that any of the contracted generation facilities experience a forced outage, Dominion Energy may not receive the level of revenue it anticipated. Dominion Energy conducts certain operations through partnership arrangements involving third-party investors which may limit Dominion Energy’s operational flexibility or result in an adverse impact on its financial results.  Certain of Dominion Energy’s operations are conducted through entities subject to partnership arrangements under which Dominion Energy has significant influence but does not control the operations of such entities or in which Dominion Energy’s control over such entities may be subject to certain rights of third-party investors. Accordingly, while Dominion Energy may have a certain level of control or influence over these entities, it may not have unilateral, or any, control over the day-to-day operations of these entities or over decisions that may have a material financial impact on the partnership participants, including Dominion Energy. In each case such partnership arrangements operate in accordance with their respective governance documents, and Dominion Energy is dependent upon third parties satisfying their respective obligations, including, as applicable, funding of their required share of capital expenditures. Such third-party investors have their own interests and objectives which may differ from those of Dominion Energy and, accordingly, disputes may arise amongst the owners of such partnership arrangements that may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses. For example, Dominion Energy has a noncontrolling 50% interest in Cove Point following the sale of a 25% controlling interest to BHE in November 2020. This controlling interest allows BHE to make decisions affecting Cove Point’s ability to retain its long-term contracts.  Cove Point is a party to certain contracts that allow a regulated service provider and a customer to mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a “negotiated rate” which may be above or below the FERC regulated, cost-based recourse rate for that service. These “negotiated rate” contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased costs which could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services. Any shortfall of revenue as a result of these “negotiated rate” contracts could decrease Cove Point’s earnings and cash flows.  The inability to maintain or renew such contracts on favorable terms may have a material impact to Dominion Energy’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  Dominion Energy is also dependent upon BHE for managing counterparty credit risk relating to Cove Point’s terminal services agreements for its liquefied natural gas export/liquefaction facility. While the counterparties’ obligations are supported by parental guarantees and letters of credit, there is no assurance that such credit support would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations in the event of a counterparty default. In addition, if a controversy arises under either terminal services agreement resulting in a judgment in Cove Point’s favor, Cove Point may need to seek to enforce a final U.S. court judgment in a foreign tribunal, which could involve a lengthy process. Accordingly, there is no assurance that BHE may pursue remedies in the event of default in the same manner as Dominion Energy would if it had unilateral control over such decisions. In addition, for certain contracted generation solar facilities in which Dominion Energy maintains a controlling interest, third-party investors hold certain protective rights. These rights may impact the ability of Dominion Energy to make certain decisions, such as the retention or distribution of available cash, significant acquisitions or dispositions of assets by those entities or the ability to sell or transfer its ownership interests.  Hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair the Companies’ operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information, damage the reputation of the Companies and otherwise have an adverse effect on the Companies’ business.  The Companies own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems. Further, the computer systems that run the Companies’ facilities are not completely isolated from external networks. There appears to be an increasing level of activity, sophistication and maturity of threat actors, in particular nation state actors, that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system and the U.S. gas transmission or distribution system. Such parties could view the Companies’ computer systems, 41 software or networks as attractive targets for cyber attack. For example, malware has been designed to target software that runs the nation’s critical infrastructure such as power transmission grids and gas pipelines. In addition, the Companies’ businesses require that they and their vendors collect and maintain sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss. A successful cyber attack on the systems that control the Companies’ electric generation, electric transmission or distribution assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing the Companies from serving customers or collecting revenues. The breach of certain business systems could affect the Companies’ ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to the Companies’ reputation. In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data at the Companies or one of their vendors could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring. If a significant breach were to occur, the reputation of the Companies also could be adversely affected. While the Companies maintain property and casualty insurance, along with other contractual provisions, that may cover certain damage caused by potential cyber incidents, all damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available. For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could materially and adversely affect the Companies’ business, financial condition and results of operations. War, acts and threats of terrorism, intentional acts and other significant events could adversely affect the Companies’ operations.  The Companies cannot predict the impact that any future terrorist attacks or retaliatory military or other action may have on the energy industry in general or on the Companies’ businesses in particular. Any such future attacks or retaliatory action may adversely affect the Companies’ operations in a variety of ways, including by disrupting the power, fuel and other markets in which the Companies operate or requiring the implementation of additional, more costly security guidelines and measures. The Companies’ infrastructure facilities, including nuclear facilities and projects under construction, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or other physical attack. Any physical compromise of the Companies’ facilities could adversely affect the Companies’ ability to generate, purchase, transmit or distribute electricity, distribute natural gas or otherwise operate their respective facilities in the most efficient manner or at all. In addition, the amount and scope of insurance coverage maintained against losses resulting from any such attack may not be sufficient to cover such losses or otherwise adequately compensate for any business disruptions that could result. Instability in financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, intentional acts, pandemic, credit crises, recession or other factors could result in a significant decline in the U.S. economy and/or increase the cost or limit the availability of insurance or adversely impact the Companies’ ability to access capital on acceptable terms. Failure to attract and retain key executive officers and an appropriately qualified workforce could have an adverse effect on the Companies’ operations.  The Companies’ business strategy is dependent on their ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees. The Companies’ key executive officers are the Executive Chairman, CEO, CFO, COO and presidents and those responsible for financial, operational, legal, regulatory and accounting functions. Competition for skilled management employees in these areas of the Companies’ business operations is high. Certain events, such as an aging workforce, mismatch of skill set, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge base and the length of time required for skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employees, or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the Companies’ business. In addition, certain specialized knowledge is required of the Companies’ technical employees for construction and operation of transmission, generation and distribution assets. The Companies’ inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect their business and future operating results. Nuclear Generation Risks The Companies have substantial ownership interests in and operate nuclear generating units; as a result, each may incur substantial costs and liabilities.  The Companies’ nuclear facilities are subject to operational, environmental, health and financial risks such as the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel, the ability to dispose of such spent nuclear fuel, the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance available, potential operational liabilities and extended outages, the costs of replacement power, the costs of maintenance and the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks. The Companies maintain decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage to minimize the financial exposure to these risks; however, it is possible that future decommissioning costs could exceed amounts in the decommissioning trusts and/or damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. If the Companies’ decommissioning trust funds are insufficient, and they are 42 not allowed to recover the additional costs incurred through insurance or regulatory mechanisms, their results of operations could be negatively impacted. The Companies’ nuclear facilities are also subject to complex government regulation which could negatively impact their results of operations. The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generating facilities. In the event of noncompliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines, set license conditions, shut down a nuclear unit, or take some combination of these actions, depending on its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require the Companies to make substantial expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, although the Companies have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at their plants, if an incident did occur, it could materially and adversely affect their results of operations and/or financial condition. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world, such as the nuclear events in Japan in 2011, could cause the NRC to adopt increased safety regulations or otherwise limit or restrict the operation or licensing of domestic nuclear units. Financial, Economic and Market Risks Changing rating agency requirements could negatively affect the Companies’ growth and business strategy.  In order to maintain appropriate credit ratings to obtain needed credit at a reasonable cost in light of existing or future rating agency requirements, the Companies may find it necessary to take steps or change their business plans in ways that may adversely affect their growth and earnings. A reduction in the Companies’ credit ratings could result in an increase in borrowing costs, loss of access to certain markets, or both, thus adversely affecting operating results and could require the Companies to post additional collateral in connection with some of its price risk management activities. An inability to access financial markets and, in the case of Dominion Energy, obtain cash from subsidiaries could adversely affect the execution of the Companies’ business plans.  The Companies rely on access to short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as significant sources of funding and liquidity for business plans with increasing capital expenditure needs, normal working capital and collateral requirements related to hedges of future sales and purchases of energy-related commodities. Deterioration in the Companies’ creditworthiness, as evaluated by credit rating agencies or otherwise, or declines in market reputation either for the Companies or their industry in general, or general financial market disruptions outside of the Companies’ control could increase their cost of borrowing or restrict their ability to access one or more financial markets. Market disruptions could stem from general market disruption due to general credit market or political events, the planned phase out of LIBOR by the end of 2023 or the reform or replacement of other benchmark rates, the failure of financial institutions on which the Companies rely or the bankruptcy of an unrelated company. Increased costs and restrictions on the Companies’ ability to access financial markets may be severe enough to affect their ability to execute their business plans as scheduled. Dominion Energy is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries. Accordingly, Dominion Energy’s ability to execute its business plan is further subject to the earnings and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or advance or repay funds to it, which may, from time to time, be subject to certain contractual restrictions or restrictions imposed by regulators. Market performance, interest rates and other changes may decrease the value of the Companies’ decommissioning trust funds and Dominion Energy’s benefit plan assets or increase Dominion Energy’s liabilities, which could then require significant additional funding.  The performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trusts to satisfy future obligations to decommission the Companies’ nuclear plants and under Dominion Energy’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The Companies have significant obligations in these areas and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below expected return rates. With respect to decommissioning trust funds, a decline in the market value of these assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations to decommission the Companies’ nuclear plants or require additional NRC-approved funding assurance. A decline in the market value of the assets held in trusts to satisfy future obligations under Dominion Energy’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans may increase the funding requirements under such plans. Additionally, changes in interest rates will affect the liabilities under Dominion Energy’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in mortality assumptions, may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. If the decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets are negatively impacted by market fluctuations or other factors, the Companies’ results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows could be negatively affected. 43  The use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses and liquidity constraints.  The Companies use derivative instruments, including futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs, to manage commodity, currency and financial market risks. In addition, Dominion Energy purchases and sells commodity-based contracts for hedging purposes. The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted into law in July 2010 in an effort to improve regulation of financial markets. The CEA, as amended by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, requires certain over-the-counter derivatives, or swaps, to be cleared through a derivatives clearing organization and, if the swap is subject to a clearing requirement, to be executed on a designated contract market or swap execution facility. Non-financial entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end users, may elect the end-user exception to the CEA’s clearing requirements. The Companies have elected to exempt their swaps from the CEA’s clearing requirements. If, as a result of changes to the rulemaking process, the Companies’ derivative activities are not exempted from the clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, the Companies could be subject to higher costs due to decreased market liquidity or increased margin payments. In addition, the Companies’ swap dealer counterparties may attempt to pass-through additional trading costs in connection with changes to or the elimination of rulemaking that implements Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. Future impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets or long-lived assets may have a material adverse effect on the Companies’ results.  Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Other intangible assets and long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that an asset’s carrying value may not be recoverable. If Dominion Energy’s goodwill, including the goodwill recorded in connection with the SCANA Combination, or the Companies’ other intangible assets or long-lived assets are in the future determined to be impaired, the applicable Company would be required during the period in which the impairment is determined to record a noncash charge to earnings that may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results. Exposure to counterparty performance may adversely affect the Companies’ financial results of operations.  The Companies are exposed to credit risks of their counterparties and the risk that one or more counterparties may fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations, including but not limited to payment for services. Some of Dominion Energy’s operations are conducted through partnership arrangements, as noted above. Counterparties could fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations for a number of reasons, including the effect of regulations on their operations. Defaults or failure to perform by customers, suppliers, contractors, joint venture partners, financial institutions or other third parties may adversely affect the Companies’ financial results. Public health crises and epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19, could adversely affect the Companies’ business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and/or cash flows.  The effects of the continued outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government responses could include extended disruptions to supply chains and capital markets, reduced labor availability and productivity and a prolonged reduction in economic activity. The effects could also have a variety of adverse impacts on the Companies, including reduced demand for energy, particularly from commercial and industrial customers, impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets and diminished ability of the Companies to access funds from financial institutions and capital markets.  There remains uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. Such restrictions may cause operational interruptions and delays in construction projects, which, in the case of renewable energy projects, could delay the expected in-service dates of these projects and financial statement impact of the investment tax credits associated with these projects. For the duration of the outbreak of COVID-19, voluntary suspension, or potential legislative or government action, such as legislation enacted in Virginia in November 2020, may limit the Companies’ ability to collect on overdue accounts or disconnect services for non-payment, which may cause a decrease in the Companies’ results of operations and cash flows"
0,D,DOMINION ENERGY INC,2020-02-28,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
  The Companies’ businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyond their control. A number of these factors have been identified below. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement or projection contained in this report, see Forward-Looking Statements in Item 7. MD&A. Regulatory, Legislative and Legal Risks  The rates of the Companies’ electric transmission, distribution and generation operations and gas transmission, storage and distribution operations are subject to regulatory review. Revenue provided by the Companies’ electric transmission, distribution and generation operations and by gas transmission and distribution operations is based primarily on rates approved by state and federal regulatory agencies. The profitability of the Companies’ businesses is dependent on their ability, through the rates that they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on their capital investment. At the federal level, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s wholesale rates for electric transmission service and various rates and charges assessed by Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas’ natural gas transmission and storage businesses are regulated by FERC. Rates for electric transmission services are updated annually according to a FERC-approved formula rate mechanism, and may be subject to additional prospective adjustments and retroactive corrections. Rates for gas transmission and storage services are adjusted in rate cases periodically and must reflect recovery of costs plus a reasonable return on investment, in accordance with cost of service ratemaking. A failure by the Companies to support these rates could result in rate decreases from current rate levels, which could adversely affect the Companies’ results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  At the state level, Virginia Power’s retail base rates, terms and conditions for generation and distribution services to customers in Virginia are reviewed by the Virginia Commission in a proceeding that involves the determination of Virginia Power’s actual earned ROE during a historic test period, and the determination of Virginia Power’s authorized ROE prospectively. Under certain circumstances described in the Regulation Act, Virginia Power may be required to refund a portion of its earnings to customers through a refund process and to reduce its rates.  In states other than Virginia, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s retail electric base rates for generation and distribution services to customers are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to the statutes, rules and procedures of such states. Dominion Energy’s rates for gas distribution to retail customers are similarly regulated at the state level. If retail electric or gas earnings exceed the returns established by state utility commissions, retail electric rates or gas rates may be subject to review and possible reduction, which may decrease the Companies’ future earnings. Additionally, if any state utility commission              28                                does not allow recovery through base rates, on a timely basis, of costs incurred in providing service, the Company’s future earnings could be negatively impacted.  Under certain circumstances, state utility regulators may impose a moratorium on increases to retail base rates for a specified period of time, which could delay recovery of costs incurred in providing service. Additionally, governmental officials, stakeholders and advocacy groups may challenge any of these regulatory reviews. Such challenges may lengthen the time, complexity and costs associated with such regulatory reviews.  Through the SCANA Combination, Dominion Energy acquired SCANA and DESC which are subject to numerous legal proceedings and ongoing governmental investigations and examinations. SCANA and DESC are defendants in numerous federal and state legal proceedings and governmental investigations relating to the decision to abandon construction at the NND Project. Among other things, the lawsuits and investigations allege misrepresentation, failure to properly manage the NND Project, unfair trade practices and violation of anti-trust laws. Additionally, pursuant to the SCANA Merger Agreement and applicable indemnification agreements, SCANA is indemnifying former directors and officers of SCANA and DESC who are defendants in federal and state legal proceedings relating to the decision to abandon construction at the NND Project and the subsequent SCANA Combination. Among other things, the lawsuits allege breaches of various fiduciary duties. The outcome of these legal proceedings, investigations and examinations, including settlements, is uncertain and may adversely affect Dominion Energy’s financial condition or results of operation.  Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s generation business may be negatively affected by possible FERC actions that could change market design in the wholesale markets or affect pricing rules or revenue calculations in the RTO markets. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s generation stations operating in RTO markets sell capacity, energy and ancillary services into wholesale electricity markets regulated by FERC. The wholesale markets allow these generation stations to take advantage of market price opportunities, but also expose them to market risk. Properly functioning competitive wholesale markets depend upon FERC’s continuation of clearly identified market rules. From time to time FERC may investigate and authorize RTOs to make changes in market design. FERC also periodically reviews Dominion Energy’s authority to sell at market-based rates. Material changes by FERC to the design of the wholesale markets or its interpretation of market rules, Dominion Energy or Virginia Power’s authority to sell power at market-based rates, or changes to pricing rules or rules involving revenue calculations, could adversely impact the future results of Dominion Energy or Virginia Power’s generation business. For example, in December 2019, FERC issued an order on PJM’s Minimum Offer Price Rule proposals finding the PJM tariff unjust and unreasonable and directed PJM to expand the Minimum Offer Price Rule to all existing and new generation resources benefitting from a state subsidy to address the effects of state subsidies on new and existing resources on the PJM capacity market. The expanded Minimum Offer Price Rule will set a floor price on new and existing state subsidized resources that do not seek a FERC exemption, increasing their risk of failing to clear the capacity auction and    not obtaining a capacity payment and obligation. In addition, there have been changes to the interpretation and application of FERC’s market manipulation rules. A failure to comply with these rules could lead to civil and criminal penalties.  The Companies are subject to complex governmental regulation, including tax regulation, that could adversely affect their results of operations and subject the Companies to monetary penalties. The Companies’ operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation and require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies. Such laws and regulations govern the terms and conditions of the services we offer, our relationships with affiliates, protection of our critical electric infrastructure assets and pipeline safety, among other matters. These operations are also subject to legislation governing taxation at the federal, state and local level. They must also comply with environmental legislation and associated regulations. Management believes that the necessary approvals have been obtained for existing operations and that the businesses are conducted in accordance with applicable laws. The Companies’ businesses are subject to regulatory regimes which could result in substantial monetary penalties if any of the Companies is found not to be in compliance, including mandatory reliability standards and interaction in the wholesale markets. New laws or regulations, the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations, changes in enforcement practices of regulators, or penalties imposed for non-compliance with existing laws or regulations may result in substantial additional expense. Recent legislative and regulatory changes that are impacting the Companies include the 2017 Tax Reform Act and tariffs imposed on imported solar panels by the U.S. government in 2018. The 2017 Tax Reform Act could have a material impact on the Companies’ operations, cash flows, and financial results. Excess accumulated deferred income taxes due to the reduction in the corporate income tax rates to 21% under the provisions of the 2017 Tax Reform Act have been recognized as regulatory liabilities and are expected to be shared with customers, generally through reductions in future rates or in the form of credits to customer bills. The 2017 Tax Reform Act includes provisions that stipulate how these excess deferred taxes may be passed back to customers for certain accelerated tax depreciation benefits. Potential reductions in future rates attributable to other, non-plant related excess deferred taxes may be determined by our regulators. The amount and timing of these reductions could be material to the Companies’ results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition. Additionally, the 2017 Tax Reform Act contains provisions that limit the interest deduction on business interest to (1) business interest income, plus (2) 30 percent of the taxpayer’s adjusted taxable income. Business interest and business interest income are defined as that allocable to a trade or business and not investment interest and income. Dominion Energy is a consolidated group with both regulated and nonregulated lines of businesses. In November 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury issued proposed regulations defining interest as any amounts associated with the time value of money or use of funds. These proposed regulations provide guidance for purposes of the exception to the interest limitation for regulated public utilities, the application of the interest limitation to consolidated groups, such as Dominion Energy, and the interest limitation with respect        29                         to partnerships and partners in those partnerships. It is unclear when that guidance may be finalized, or whether that guidance could result in a disallowance of a portion of our interest deductions in the future.  Environmental Risks  The Companies’ operations and construction activities are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations which impose significant compliance costs on the Companies. The Companies’ operations and construction activities are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources, and health and safety. Compliance with these legal requirements requires the Companies to commit significant capital toward permitting, emission fees, environmental monitoring, installation and operation of environmental control equipment and purchase of allowances and/or offsets. Additionally, the Companies could be responsible for expenses relating to remediation and containment obligations, including at sites where they have been identified by a regulatory agency as a potentially responsible party. Expenditures relating to environmental compliance have been significant in the past, and the Companies expect that they will remain significant in the future. Certain facilities have become uneconomical to operate and have been shut down, converted to new fuel types or sold. These types of events could occur again in the future. We expect that existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and/or new laws may be adopted including regulation of GHG emissions which could have an impact on the Companies’ business (risks relating to regulation of GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units are discussed in more detail below). In addition, further regulation of air quality and GHG emissions under the CAA have been imposed on the natural gas sector, including rules to limit methane leakage. The Companies are also subject to federal water and waste regulations, including regulations concerning cooling water intake structures, coal combustion by-product handling and disposal practices, wastewater discharges from steam electric generating stations, management and disposal of hydraulic fracturing fluids and the potential further regulation of polychlorinated biphenyls. Compliance costs cannot be estimated with certainty due to the inability to predict the requirements and timing of implementation of any new environmental rules or regulations. Other factors which affect the ability to predict future environmental expenditures with certainty include the difficulty in estimating clean-up costs and quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liabilities on all responsible parties. However, such expenditures, if material, could make the Companies’ facilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect the Companies’ results of operations, financial performance or liquidity. Any additional federal and/or state requirements imposed on energy companies mandating limitations on GHG emissions or requiring efficiency improvements may result in compliance costs that alone or in combination could make some of the Companies’ electric generation units or natural gas facilities uneconomical to maintain or operate. The ACE Rule, which became effective in September 2019, is targeted at reducing CO2 emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. The ACE    Rule requires states to develop plans by July 2022 to implement CO2 performance standards. State plans must be approved by the EPA by January 2024. States are also contemplating regulations regarding GHG emissions. For example, the Virginia General Assembly is considering legislation which would authorize Virginia to directly join the RGGI program as a full participant. Compliance with the ACE Rule or other federal or state carbon regulations, such as the RGGI program, is expected to require increasing the energy efficiency of equipment at facilities, committing significant capital toward carbon reduction programs, purchase of allowances and/or emission offset credits, fuel switching, and/or retirement of high-emitting generation facilities and potential replacement with lower-emitting generation facilities. Given these developments and uncertainties, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power cannot estimate the aggregate effect of such requirements on their results of operations, financial condition or their customers. However, such expenditures, if material, could make Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s generation facilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect Dominion Energy or Virginia Power’s results of operations, financial performance or liquidity.  There are also potential impacts on Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas’ natural gas businesses as federal or state GHG regulations may require GHG emission reductions from the natural gas sector which, in addition to resulting in increased costs, could affect demand for natural gas. Additionally, GHG requirements could result in increased demand for energy conservation and renewable products, which could impact the natural gas businesses.  Dominion Energy and Virginia Power are subject to risks associated with the disposal and storage of coal ash. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power historically produced and continue to produce coal ash, or CCRs, as a by-product of their coal-fired generation operations. The ash is stored and managed in impoundments (ash ponds) and landfills located at 11 different facilities, eight of which are at Virginia Power. The EPA has issued regulations concerning the management and storage of CCRs, which Virginia has adopted. These CCR regulations require Dominion Energy and Virginia Power to make additional capital expenditures and increase operating and maintenance expenses. In addition, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power will incur expenses and other costs associated with closing, corrective action and ongoing monitoring of certain ash ponds. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power also may face litigation concerning their coal ash facilities.  Further, while Dominion Energy and Virginia Power operate their ash ponds and landfills in compliance with applicable state safety regulations, a release of coal ash with a significant environmental impact, such as the Dan River ash basin release by a neighboring utility, could result in remediation costs, civil and/or criminal penalties, claims, litigation, increased regulation and compliance costs, and reputational damage, and could impact the financial condition of Dominion Energy and/or Virginia Power.  Construction Risks  The Companies’ infrastructure build and expansion plans often require regulatory approval, including environmental permits, before commencing construction and completing projects. The               30                                 Companies may not complete facility construction, pipeline, conversion or other infrastructure projects that they commence, or they may complete projects on materially different terms, costs or timing than initially estimated or anticipated, and they may not be able to achieve the intended benefits of any such project, if completed. Several facility construction, pipeline, electric transmission line, expansion, conversion and other infrastructure projects have been announced and additional projects may be considered in the future. The Companies compete for projects with companies of varying size and financial capabilities, including some that may have competitive advantages. Commencing construction on announced and future projects may require approvals from applicable state and federal agencies, and such approvals could include mitigation costs which may be material to the Companies. Projects may not be able to be completed on time or in accordance with our estimated costs as a result of weather conditions, delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory approvals, delays in obtaining key materials, labor difficulties, difficulties with partners or potential partners, a decline in the credit strength of counterparties or vendors, or other factors beyond the Companies’ control. For example, Atlantic Coast Pipeline has experienced certain delays in obtaining and maintaining permits necessary for construction along with construction delays due to judicial actions which has impacted the cost and schedule for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project. Even if facility construction, pipeline, expansion, electric transmission line, conversion and other infrastructure projects are completed, the total costs of the projects may be higher than anticipated and the performance of the business of the Companies following completion of the projects may not meet expectations. Start-up and operational issues can arise in connection with the commencement of commercial operations at our facilities. Such issues may include failure to meet specific operating parameters, which may require adjustments to meet or amend these operating parameters. Additionally, the Companies may not be able to timely and effectively integrate the projects into their operations and such integration may result in unforeseen operating difficulties or unanticipated costs. Further, regulators may disallow recovery of some of the costs of a project if they are deemed not to be prudently incurred. Any of these or other factors could adversely affect the Companies’ ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the facility construction, pipeline, electric transmission line, expansion, conversion and other infrastructure projects. The development, construction and commissioning of several large-scale infrastructure projects simultaneously involves significant execution risk. The Companies are currently simultaneously developing, constructing or commissioning several major projects, including the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project, the Supply Header project and the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project. Several of the Companies’ key projects are increasingly large-scale, complex and being constructed in constrained geographic areas or in difficult terrain, for example, the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project. The advancement of the Companies’ ventures is also affected by the interventions, litigation or other activities of stakeholder and advocacy groups, some of which oppose natural gas-related  and energy infrastructure projects. For example, certain landowners and stakeholder groups oppose the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project, which could impede construction activities or the    acquisition of rights-of-way and other land rights on a timely basis or on acceptable terms. Given that these projects provide the foundation for the Companies’ strategic growth plan, if the Companies are unable to obtain or maintain the required approvals, develop the necessary technical expertise, allocate and coordinate sufficient resources, adhere to budgets and timelines, effectively handle public outreach efforts, or otherwise fail to successfully execute the projects, there could be an adverse impact to the Companies’ financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Failure to comply with regulatory approval conditions or an adverse ruling in any future litigation could adversely affect the Companies’ ability to execute their business plan. The Companies are dependent on their contractors for the successful and timely completion of large-scale infrastructure projects. The construction of such projects is expected to take several years, is typically confined within a limited geographic area or difficult terrain and could be subject to delays, cost overruns, labor disputes and other factors that could cause the total cost of the project to exceed the anticipated amount and adversely affect the Companies’ financial performance and/or impair the Companies’ ability to execute the business plan for the project as scheduled.  Further, an inability to obtain financing or otherwise provide liquidity for the projects on acceptable terms could negatively affect the Companies’ financial condition, cash flows, the projects’ anticipated financial results and/or impair the Companies’ ability to execute the business plan for the projects as scheduled.  Operational Risks  The Companies’ financial performance and condition can be affected by changes in the weather, including the effects of global climate change. Fluctuations in weather can affect demand for the Companies’ services. For example, milder than normal weather can reduce demand for electricity and gas transmission and distribution services. In addition, severe weather, including hurricanes, winter storms, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters can stress systems, disrupt operation of the Companies’ facilities and cause service outages, production delays and property damage that require incurring additional expenses. Changes in weather conditions can result in reduced water levels or changes in water temperatures that could adversely affect operations at some of the Companies’ power stations. Furthermore, the Companies’ operations could be adversely affected and their physical plant placed at greater risk of damage should changes in global climate produce, among other possible conditions, unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, abnormal levels of precipitation and, for operations located on or near coastlines, a change in sea level or sea temperatures. Due to the location of Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s electric utility service territories and a number of its other facilities in the eastern portions of the states of South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia which are frequently in the path of hurricanes, we experience the consequences of these weather events to a greater degree than many of our industry peers. The Companies’ operations are subject to operational hazards, equipment failures, supply chain disruptions and personnel issues which could negatively affect the Companies. Operation of the Companies’ facilities involves risk, including the risk of potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to       31                         aging infrastructure, fuel supply, pipeline integrity or transportation disruptions, accidents, labor disputes or work stoppages by employees, acts of terrorism or sabotage, construction delays or cost overruns, shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material and labor, operational restrictions resulting from environmental limitations and governmental interventions, changes to the environment and performance below expected levels. The Companies’ businesses are dependent upon sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, the failure of which could prevent them from accomplishing critical business functions. Because the Companies’ transmission facilities, pipelines and other facilities are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of their facilities and pipelines could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties.  Operation of the Companies’ facilities below expected capacity levels could result in lost revenues and increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs. Unplanned outages of the Companies’ facilities and extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of the Companies’ business. Unplanned outages typically increase the Companies’ operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce their revenues as a result of selling less output or may require the Companies to incur significant costs as a result of operating higher cost units or obtaining replacement output from third parties in the open market to satisfy forward energy and capacity or other contractual obligations. Moreover, if the Companies are unable to perform their contractual obligations, penalties or liability for damages could result.  In addition, there are many risks associated with the Companies’ operations and the transportation, storage and processing of natural gas and NGLs, including nuclear accidents, fires, explosions, uncontrolled release of natural gas and other environmental hazards, pole strikes, electric contact cases, the collision of third party equipment with pipelines and avian and other wildlife impacts. Such incidents could result in loss of human life or injuries among employees, customers or the public in general, environmental pollution, damage or destruction of facilities or business interruptions and associated public or employee safety impacts, loss of revenues, increased liabilities, heightened regulatory scrutiny and reputational risk. Further, the location of pipelines and storage facilities, or generation, transmission, substations and distribution facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks.  Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas conduct certain operations through partnership arrangements involving third-party investors that may limit our operational flexibility. Certain operations are conducted through partnership arrangements, such as Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Iroquois, to which Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas have significant influence but do not control the operations of such entities. Accordingly, Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas may have limited ability to influence, as they do not control, certain day to day activities affecting the operations and do not have unilateral control over decisions that may have a material financial impact on the partnership participants. Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas also conduct    certain operations through entities, such as Cove Point and the owners of certain contracted generation solar facilities, to which Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas maintain a controlling interest, but third-party investors hold certain protective rights. These rights may impact the ability of Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas to make certain decisions, such as the retention or distribution of available cash, significant acquisitions or dispositions of assets or the ability to sell or transfer their ownership interests. In each case such partnership arrangements operate in accordance with their respective governance documents, and Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas are dependent upon third parties satisfying their respective obligations, including, as applicable, funding of their required share of capital expenditures. Such third-party investors have their own interests and objectives which may differ from those of Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas and, accordingly, disputes may arise amongst the owners of such partnership arrangements that may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses.  The Companies’ financial results can be adversely affected by various factors driving supply and demand for electricity and gas and related services. Technological advances required by federal laws mandate new levels of energy efficiency in end-use devices, including lighting, furnaces and electric heat pumps and could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption. Additionally, certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by a fixed date. Further, Virginia Power’s business model is premised upon the cost efficiency of the production, transmission and distribution of large-scale centralized utility generation. However, advances in distributed generation technologies, such as solar cells, gas microturbines, battery storage and fuel cells, may make these alternative generation methods competitive with large-scale utility generation, and change how customers acquire or use our services. Virginia Power has an exclusive franchise to serve retail electric customers in Virginia. However, Virginia’s Retail Access Statutes allow certain electric generation customers exceptions to this franchise. As market conditions change, Virginia Power’s customers may further pursue exceptions and Virginia Power’s exclusive franchise may erode. Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due to customer adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, distributed generation, regional economic conditions, or the impact of additional compliance obligations, unless substantially offset through regulatory cost allocations, could adversely impact the value of the Companies’ business activities.  The Companies may be materially adversely affected by negative publicity. From time to time, political and public sentiment in connection with significant transactions and infrastructure projects, such as the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, the SCANA Merger and the abandonment of the NND Project, may result in a significant amount of adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting the Companies. Additionally, any failure by the Companies to realize voluntary targets set with respect to the reduction of GHG emissions or other long-term goals could lead to adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting the Companies. Adverse press coverage and other adverse statements, whether or not driven by political or public sentiment, may also result in investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in legal claims.               32                                         Addressing any adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny or enforcement or other legal proceedings is time consuming and expensive and, regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made, can have a negative impact on the reputation of the Companies, on the morale and performance of their employees and on their relationships with their respective regulators, customers and commercial counterparties. It may also have a negative impact on the Companies’ ability to take timely advantage of various business and market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects of negative publicity, and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may have a material adverse effect on the Companies’ business, financial condition and results of operations.  Dominion Energy’s merchant generation business operates in a challenging market, which could adversely affect its results of operations and future growth. The success of Dominion Energy’s contracted generation business depends upon favorable market conditions including the ability to sell power at prices sufficient to cover its operating costs. Dominion Energy operates in active wholesale markets that expose it to price volatility for electricity and nuclear fuel as well as the credit risk of counterparties. Dominion Energy attempts to manage its price risk by entering into long-term power purchase agreements with customers as well as hedging transactions, including short-term and long-term fixed price sales and purchase contracts. In these wholesale markets, the spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the cost of supplying the next unit of electricity to the market during that hour. In many cases, the next unit of electricity supplied would be provided by generating stations that consume fossil fuels, primarily natural gas. Consequently, the open market wholesale price for electricity generally reflects the cost of natural gas plus the cost to convert the fuel to electricity. Therefore, changes in the price of natural gas generally affect the open market wholesale price of electricity. To the extent Dominion Energy does not enter into long-term power purchase agreements or otherwise effectively hedge its output, these changes in market prices could adversely affect its financial results.  Dominion Energy purchases nuclear fuel primarily under long-term contracts. Dominion Energy is exposed to nuclear fuel cost volatility for the portion of its nuclear fuel obtained through short-term contracts or on the spot market, including as a result of market supply shortages. Nuclear fuel prices can be volatile and the price that can be obtained for power produced may not change at the same rate as nuclear fuel costs, thus adversely impacting Dominion Energy’s financial results. In addition, in the event that any of the contracted generation facilities experience a forced outage, Dominion Energy may not receive the level of revenue it anticipated.  Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas may not be able to maintain, renew or replace their existing portfolio of customer contracts successfully, or on favorable terms. Upon contract expiration, customers may not elect to re-contract with Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas as a result of a variety of factors, including the amount of competition in the industry, changes in the price of electricity or natural gas, their level of satisfaction with Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas’ services, the extent to which Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas are able to successfully execute their business plans and the effect of the regulatory framework on customer demand. The failure to replace any such customer contracts on    similar terms or with counterparties with similar credit profiles could result in a loss of revenue for Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas and related decreases in their earnings and cash flows.  Certain of Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas’ gas pipeline services are subject to long-term, fixed-price “negotiated rate” contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if the cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts. Under FERC policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a “negotiated rate” which may be above or below the FERC regulated, cost-based recourse rate for that service. These “negotiated rate” contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased costs which could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services. Any shortfall of revenue as a result of these “negotiated rate” contracts could decrease Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas’ earnings and cash flows. Hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair the Companies’ operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information, damage the reputation of the Companies and otherwise have an adverse effect on the Companies’ business. The Companies own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems. Further, the computer systems that run the Companies’ facilities are not completely isolated from external networks. There appears to be an increasing level of activity, sophistication and maturity of threat actors, in particular nation state actors, that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system and the U.S. gas transmission or distribution system. Such parties could view the Companies’ computer systems, software or networks as attractive targets for cyber attack. For example, malware has been designed to target software that runs the nation’s critical infrastructure such as power transmission grids and gas pipelines. In addition, the Companies’ businesses require that they and their vendors collect and maintain sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss. A successful cyber attack on the systems that control the Companies’ electric generation, electric or gas transmission or distribution assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing the Companies from serving customers or collecting revenues. The breach of certain business systems could affect the Companies’ ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to the Companies’ reputation. In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data at the Companies or one of their vendors could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring. If a significant breach were to occur, the reputation of the Companies also could be adversely affected. While the Companies maintain property and casualty insurance, along with other contractual provisions, that may cover certain damage caused by potential cyber incidents, all damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available. For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could materially and adversely affect the Companies’ business, financial condition and results of operations.        33                         War, acts and threats of terrorism, intentional acts and other significant events could adversely affect the Companies’ operations. The Companies cannot predict the impact that any future terrorist attacks or retaliatory military or other action may have on the energy industry in general or on the Companies’ businesses in particular. Any such future attacks or retaliatory action may adversely affect the Companies’ operations in a variety of ways, including by disrupting the power, fuel and other markets in which the Companies operate or requiring the implementation of additional, more costly security guidelines and measures. The Companies’ infrastructure facilities, including nuclear facilities and projects under construction, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or other physical attack. Any physical compromise of the Companies’ facilities could adversely affect the Companies’ ability to generate, purchase, transmit or distribute electricity, store, transmit or distribute natural gas, store or export LNG or otherwise operate their respective facilities in the most efficient manner or at all. In addition, the amount and scope of insurance coverage maintained against losses resulting from any such attack may not be sufficient to cover such losses or otherwise adequately compensate for any business disruptions that could result. Instability in financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, intentional acts, pandemic, credit crises, recession or other factors could result in a significant decline in the U.S. economy and/or increase the cost or limit the availability of insurance or adversely impact the Companies’ ability to access capital on acceptable terms.  Failure to attract and retain key executive officers and an appropriately qualified workforce could have an adverse effect on the Companies’ operations. The Companies’ business strategy is dependent on their ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees. The Companies’ key executive officers are the CEO, CFO, Co-COOs and presidents and those responsible for financial, operational, legal, regulatory and accounting functions. Competition for skilled management employees in these areas of the Companies’ business operations is high. Certain events, such as an aging workforce, mismatch of skill set, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge base and the length of time required for skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employees, or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the Companies’ business. In addition, certain specialized knowledge is required of the Companies’ technical employees for construction and operation of transmission, generation and distribution assets. The Companies’ inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect their business and future operating results. Dominion Energy may be unable to successfully integrate SCANA’s businesses. Dominion Energy is devoting significant resources to integrating SCANA’s businesses. While Dominion Energy has assumed that a certain level of transaction and integration expenses will be incurred, there are a number of factors beyond its control that could affect the total amount or the timing of its integration expenses. Potential complexities associated with integrating SCANA, including its utility businesses, while at the same time continuing to provide consistent, high quality services    and with integrating a company with different markets and customers could arise. Due to the complexities involved in integrating SCANA and its different markets and customers, it is possible that the process could result in the disruption of Dominion Energy’s ongoing business or inconsistencies in its services, standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect the ability of Dominion Energy to maintain or establish relationships with current and prospective customers, vendors and employees or could otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of Dominion Energy.  Nuclear Generation Risks  Dominion Energy and Virginia Power have substantial ownership interests in and operate nuclear generating units; as a result, each may incur substantial costs and liabilities. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s nuclear facilities are subject to operational, environmental, health and financial risks such as the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel, the ability to dispose of such spent nuclear fuel, the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance available, potential operational liabilities and extended outages, the costs of replacement power, the costs of maintenance and the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power maintain decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage to minimize the financial exposure to these risks; however, it is possible that future decommissioning costs could exceed amounts in the decommissioning trusts and/or damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. If Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s decommissioning trust funds are insufficient, and they are not allowed to recover the additional costs incurred through insurance or regulatory mechanisms, their results of operations could be negatively impacted. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s nuclear facilities are also subject to complex government regulation which could negatively impact their results of operations. The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generating facilities. In the event of noncompliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines, set license conditions, shut down a nuclear unit, or take some combination of these actions, depending on its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require Dominion Energy and Virginia Power to make substantial expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, although the Companies have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at their plants, if an incident did occur, it could materially and adversely affect their results of operations and/or financial condition. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world, such as the nuclear events in Japan in 2011, could cause the NRC to adopt increased safety regulations or otherwise limit or restrict the operation or licensing of domestic nuclear units.  Financial, Economic and Market Risks  Exposure to counterparty performance may adversely affect the Companies’ financial results of operations. The Companies are exposed to credit risks of their counterparties and the risk that one or more counterparties may fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations, including but not limited to payment               34                                 for services. Some of Dominion Energy’s and Dominion Energy Gas’ operations are conducted through partnership arrangements, as noted above. Counterparties could fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations for a number of reasons, including the effect of regulations on their operations. Defaults or failure to perform by customers, suppliers, contractors, joint venture partners, financial institutions or other third parties may adversely affect the Companies’ financial results.  Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas are exposed to counterparty credit risk relating to Cove Point’s terminal services agreements for the Liquefaction Facility. While the counterparties’ obligations are supported by parental guarantees and letters of credit, there is no assurance that such credit support would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations in the event of a counterparty default. In addition, if a controversy arises under either agreement resulting in a judgment in Cove Point’s favor, Cove Point may need to seek to enforce a final U.S. court judgment in a foreign tribunal, which could involve a lengthy process.  Changing rating agency requirements could negatively affect the Companies’ growth and business strategy. In order to maintain appropriate credit ratings to obtain needed credit at a reasonable cost in light of existing or future rating agency requirements, the Companies may find it necessary to take steps or change their business plans in ways that may adversely affect their growth and earnings. A reduction in the Companies’ credit ratings could result in an increase in borrowing costs, loss of access to certain markets, or both, thus adversely affecting operating results and could require the Companies to post additional collateral in connection with some of its price risk management activities. An inability to access financial markets and, in the case of Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas, obtain cash from subsidiaries could adversely affect the execution of the Companies’ business plans. The Companies rely on access to short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as significant sources of funding and liquidity for business plans with increasing capital expenditure needs, normal working capital and collateral requirements related to hedges of future sales and purchases of energy-related commodities. Deterioration in the Companies’ creditworthiness, as evaluated by credit rating agencies or otherwise, or declines in market reputation either for the Companies or their industry in general, or general financial market disruptions outside of the Companies’ control could increase their cost of borrowing or restrict their ability to access one or more financial markets. Market disruptions could stem from general market disruption due to general credit market or political events, the planned phase out of LIBOR by the end of 2021 or reform or replacement of other benchmark rates, the failure of financial institutions on which the Companies rely or the bankruptcy of an unrelated company. Increased costs and restrictions on the Companies’ ability to access financial markets may be severe enough to affect their ability to execute their business plans as scheduled. Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas are holding companies that conduct all of their operations through their respective subsidiaries. Accordingly, each entity’s ability to execute its business plan is further subject to the earnings and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or advance or repay funds to it, which may, from time to time, be subject to certain contractual restrictions or restrictions imposed by regulators.     Market performance, interest rates and other changes may decrease the value of Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s decommissioning trust funds and Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas’ benefit plan assets or increase Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas’ liabilities, which could then require significant additional funding. The performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trusts to satisfy future obligations to decommission Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s nuclear plants and under Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas’ pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The Companies have significant obligations in these areas and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below expected return rates. With respect to decommissioning trust funds, a decline in the market value of these assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations to decommission Dominion Energy and Virginia Power’s nuclear plants or require additional NRC-approved funding assurance.  A decline in the market value of the assets held in trusts to satisfy future obligations under Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas’ pension and other postretirement benefit plans may increase the funding requirements under such plans. Additionally, changes in interest rates will affect the liabilities under Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas’ pension and other postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in mortality assumptions, may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  If the decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets are negatively impacted by market fluctuations or other factors, the Companies’ results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows could be negatively affected.  The use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses and liquidity constraints. The Companies use derivative instruments, including futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs, to manage commodity, currency and financial market risks. In addition, Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas purchase and sell commodity-based contracts for hedging purposes. The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted into law in July 2010 in an effort to improve regulation of financial markets. The CEA, as amended by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, requires certain over-the-counter derivatives, or swaps, to be cleared through a derivatives clearing organization and, if the swap is subject to a clearing requirement, to be executed on a designated contract market or swap execution facility. Non-financial entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end users, may elect the end-user exception to the CEA’s clearing requirements. The Companies have elected to exempt their swaps from the CEA’s clearing requirements. If, as a result of changes to the rulemaking process, the Companies’ derivative activities are not exempted from the clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, the Companies could be subject to higher costs due to decreased market liquidity or increased margin payments. In addition, the Companies’ swap dealer counterparties may attempt to pass-through additional trading costs in connection with changes to or the elimination of rulemaking that implements Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act.       35                         Future impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets or long-lived assets may have a material adverse effect on the Companies’ results. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Other intangible assets and long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that an asset’s carrying value may not be recoverable. If Dominion Energy or Dominion Energy Gas’ goodwill, including the goodwill recorded by Dominion Energy in connection with the    SCANA Combination and the Dominion Energy Questar Combination, or the Companies’ other intangible assets or long-lived assets are in the future determined to be impaired, the applicable Company may be required during the period in which the impairment is determined to record a noncash charge to earnings that may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results.    "
8,D,DOMINION ENERGY INC,2019-02-28,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
 The Companies businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may materially affect actualresults and are often beyond their control. A number of these factors have been identified below. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement or projection contained inthis report, see Forward-Looking Statements in Item 7. MD&A.  The Companies results of operations can be affectedby changes in the weather. Fluctuations in weather can affect demand for the Companies services. For example, milder than normal weather can reduce demand for electricity and gas transmission and distribution services. In addition, severeweather, including hurricanes, winter storms, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters can stress systems, disrupt operation of the Companies facilities and cause service outages, production delays and property damage that requireincurring additional expenses. Changes in weather conditions can result in reduced water levels or changes in water temperatures that could adversely affect operations at some of the Companies power stations. Furthermore, the Companiesoperations could be adversely affected and their physical plant placed at greater risk of damage should changes in global climate produce, among other possible conditions, unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in moreintense, frequent and extreme weather events, abnormal levels of precipitation and, for operations located on or near coastlines, a change in sea level or sea temperatures.The rates of Dominion Energy and Dominion EnergyGas gas transmission and distribution operations and Dominion Energy and Virginia Powers electric transmission, distribution and generation operations are subject to regulatory review.Revenue provided by Dominion Energy and Virginia Powers electric transmission, distribution and generation operations and Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas gas transmission and distribution operations is based primarily onrates approved by state and federal regulatory agencies. However, certain large scale customers are able to enter into negotiated-rate contracts rather than paycost-of-service rates which are subject to regulatory review. The profitability of these businesses is dependent on their ability, through the rates that they arepermitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on their capital investment.  Dominion Energy and VirginiaPowers wholesale rates for electric transmission service are updated on an annual basis through operation of a FERC-approved formula rate mechanism. Through this mechanism, Dominion Energy and Virginia Powers wholesale rates for electrictransmission reflect the estimated cost-of-service for each calendar year. The difference in the estimated cost-of-service and actual cost-of-service for each calendar year is included as an adjustment to the wholesale rates forelectric transmission service in a subsequent calendar year. These wholesale rates are subject to FERC review and prospective adjustment in the event that customers and/or interested state commissions file a complaint with FERC and are able todemonstrate that Dominion Energy or Virginia Powers wholesale revenue requirement is no longer just and reasonable. They are also subject to retroactive corrections to the extent that the formula rate was not properly populated with the actualcosts.  Similarly, various rates and charges assessed by Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas gas transmission businesses aresubject to review by FERC. In addition, the rates of Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas gas distribution businesses are subject to state regulatory review in the jurisdictions in which they operate. A failure by Dominion Energy orDominion Energy Gas to support these rates could result in rate decreases from current rate levels, which could adversely affect Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Virginia Powers base rates, terms and conditions for generation and distribution services to customers in Virginia are reviewed by theVirginia Commission in a proceeding that involves the determination of Virginia Powers actual earned ROE during a historic test period, and the determination of Virginia Powers authorized ROE prospectively. Under certain circumstancesdescribed in the Regulation Act, Virginia Power may be required to share a portion of its earnings with customers through a refund process. Dominion Energy and Virginia Powers retail electric base rates for bundled generation, transmission, and distribution services tocustomers in South Carolina and North Carolina, respectively, are regulated on acost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to South Carolina and North Carolinastatutes, and the rules and procedures of the South Carolina and North Carolina Commissions. If retail electric earnings exceed the returns established by the South Carolina Commission and the North Carolina Commission, retail electric rates may besubject to review and   29   possible reduction by the South Carolina Commission and the North Carolina Commission, which may decrease Dominion Energy and Virginia Powers future earnings, respectively. Additionally, ifthe South Carolina and the North Carolina Commission do not allow recovery through base rates, on a timely basis, of costs incurred in providing service, Dominion Energy and Virginia Powers future earnings could be negatively impacted. Governmental officials, stakeholders and advocacy groups may challenge these regulatory reviews. Such challenges may lengthen the time,complexity and costs associated with such regulatory reviews.  The Companies are subject to complex governmental regulation, includingtax regulation, that could adversely affect their results of operations and subject the Companies to monetary penalties. The Companies operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation and require numerouspermits, approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies. Such laws and regulations govern the terms and conditions of the services we offer, our relationships with affiliates, protection of our critical electric infrastructure assetsand pipeline safety, among other matters. These operations are also subject to legislation governing taxation at the federal, state and local level. They must also comply with environmental legislation and associated regulations. Management believesthat the necessary approvals have been obtained for existing operations and that the business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws. The Companies businesses are subject to regulatory regimes which could result in substantialmonetary penalties if any of the Companies is found not to be in compliance, including mandatory reliability standards and interaction in the wholesale markets. New laws or regulations, the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws orregulations, changes in enforcement practices of regulators, or penalties imposed for non-compliance with existing laws or regulations may result in substantial additional expense. Recent legislative andregulatory changes that are impacting the Companies include the 2017 Tax Reform Act and tariffs imposed on imported solar panels by the U.S. government in 2018. The 2017 Tax Reform Act could have a material impact on our operations, cash flows, and financial results. Reductions in the estimatedannual cost-of-service effect (commonly referred to as the gross-up factor) due to the reduction in the corporate income taxrates to 21% under the provisions of the 2017 Tax Reform Act have been recognized as a regulatory liability and are expected to be refunded to customers, generally through reductions in future rates or in the form of credits to customer bills. Inaddition, the Companies regulators may require the reduction in accumulated deferred income tax balances under the provisions of the 2017 Tax Reform Act to be shared with customers, generally through reductions in future rates or in the formof credits to customer bills. The 2017 Tax Reform Act includes provisions that stipulate how these excess deferred taxes may be passed back to customers for certain accelerated tax depreciation benefits. Potential reductions in future ratesattributable to other, non-plant related excess deferred taxes may be determined by our regulators. The 2017 Tax Reform Act could have a material impact on Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas FERC-regulated gas operationsincluding rates charged to customers. In light of the reduction in the income tax rate in the 2017 Tax Reform Act, our FERC-regulated gas subsidiaries were required to fileinformational reports to substantiate the rates charged for transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce, when viewed holistically, are just and reasonable takinginto account the effects of the 2017 Tax Reform Act and all other drivers. It is unclear if FERC will mandate a one-time rate reset or Section 5 rate case for Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy GasFERC-regulated gas subsidiaries; however, any such action could have a material impact on our operations, cash flows and financial results. The interpretation of provisions of the 2017 Tax Reform Act that take effect in 2019 may significantly impact our operations. The 2017Tax Reform Act contains provisions that limit the deductibility of interest expense. The provisions generally limit the interest deduction on business interest to (1) business interest income, plus (2) 30 percent of the taxpayersadjusted taxable income. Business interest and business interest income is defined as that allocable to a trade or business and not investment interest and income. Dominion Energy is a consolidated group with both regulated and nonregulated lines ofbusinesses. In November 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury issued proposed regulations defining interest as any amounts associated with the time value of money or use of funds. These proposed regulations provide guidance for purposes of theexception to the interest limitation for regulated public utilities, the application of the interest limitation to consolidated groups, such as Dominion Energy, and the interest limitation with respect to partnerships and partners in thosepartnerships. It is unclear when that guidance may be finalized, or whether that guidance could result in a disallowance of a portion of our interest deductions in the future. Dominion Energy and Virginia Powers generation business may be negatively affected by possible FERC actions that could change marketdesign in the wholesale markets or affect pricing rules or revenue calculations in the RTO markets. Dominion Energy and Virginia Powers generation stations operating in RTO markets sell capacity, energy and ancillary services intowholesale electricity markets regulated by FERC. The wholesale markets allow these generation stations to take advantage of market price opportunities, but also expose them to market risk. Properly functioning competitive wholesale markets dependupon FERCs continuation of clearly identified market rules. From time to time FERC may investigate and authorize RTOs to make changes in market design. FERC also periodically reviews Dominion Energys authority to sell at market-basedrates. Material changes by FERC to the design of the wholesale markets or its interpretation of market rules, Dominion Energy or Virginia Powers authority to sell power at market-based rates, or changes to pricing rules or rules involvingrevenue calculations, could adversely impact the future results of Dominion Energy or Virginia Powers generation business. For example, in June 2018, FERC issued an order on PJMs Minimum Offer Price Rule proposals finding the PJM tariffunjust and unreasonable because state out-of-market support for resources is suppressing PJM capacity prices and the current tariff provisions do not adequately addressthe price suppression. FERC is evaluating an alternative that would pull any state supported resource out of the capacity market along with an equivalent amount of load. In addition, there have been changes to the interpretation and application ofFERCs market manipulation rules. A failure to comply with these rules could lead to civil and criminal penalties.   30       The Companies infrastructure build and expansion plans often requireregulatory approval, including environmental permits, before commencing construction and completing projects. The Companies may not complete facility construction, pipeline, conversion or other infrastructure projects that they commence, or they maycomplete projects on materially different terms or timing than initially anticipated, and they may not be able to achieve the intended benefits of any such project, if completed. Several facility construction, pipeline, electrictransmission line, expansion, conversion and other infrastructure projects have been announced and additional projects may be considered in the future. The Companies compete for projects with companies of varying size and financial capabilities,including some that may have competitive advantages. Commencing construction on announced and future projects may require approvals from applicable state and federal agencies, and such approvals could include mitigation costs which may be materialto the Companies. Projects may not be able to be completed on time as a result of weather conditions, delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory approvals, delays in obtaining key materials, labor difficulties, difficulties with partners orpotential partners, a decline in the credit strength of counterparties or vendors, or other factors beyond the Companies control. For example, Atlantic Coast Pipeline has experienced certain delays in obtaining permits necessary forconstruction along with construction delays due to judicial actions which has impacted the cost and schedule for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project. Even if facility construction, pipeline, expansion, electric transmission line, conversion andother infrastructure projects are completed, the total costs of the projects may be higher than anticipated and the performance of the business of the Companies following completion of the projects may not meet expectations. Start-up and operational issues can arise in connection with the commencement of commercial operations at our facilities. Such issues may include failure to meet specific operating parameters, which may requireadjustments to meet or amend these operating parameters. Additionally, the Companies may not be able to timely and effectively integrate the projects into their operations and such integration may result in unforeseen operating difficulties orunanticipated costs. Further, regulators may disallow recovery of some of the costs of a project if they are deemed not to be prudently incurred. Any of these or other factors could adversely affect the Companies ability to realize theanticipated benefits from the facility construction, pipeline, electric transmission line, expansion, conversion and other infrastructure projects. The development, construction and commissioning of several large-scale infrastructure projects simultaneously involves significantexecution risk. The Companies are currently simultaneously developing, constructing or commissioning several major projects, including the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project, the Supply Header project and the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project.Several of the Companies key projects are increasingly large-scale, complex and being constructed in constrained geographic areas or in difficult terrain, for example, the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project. The advancement of the Companiesventures is also affected by the interventions, litigation or other activities of stakeholder and advocacy groups, some of which oppose natural gas-related and energy infrastructure projects. For example,certain landowners and stakeholder groups oppose the Atlantic Coast PipelineProject, which could impede construction activities or the acquisition of rights-of-way and other land rights on atimely basis or on acceptable terms. Given that these projects provide the foundation for the Companies strategic growth plan, if the Companies are unable to obtain or maintain the required approvals, develop the necessary technical expertise,allocate and coordinate sufficient resources, adhere to budgets and timelines, effectively handle public outreach efforts, or otherwise fail to successfully execute the projects, there could be an adverse impact to the Companies financialposition, results of operations and cash flows. Failure to comply with regulatory approval conditions or an adverse ruling in any future litigation could adversely affect the Companies ability to execute their business plan. The Companies are dependent on their contractors for the successful and timely completion of large-scale infrastructure projects. Theconstruction of such projects is expected to take several years, is typically confined within a limited geographic area or difficult terrain and could be subject to delays, cost overruns, labor disputes and other factors that could cause the totalcost of the project to exceed the anticipated amount and adversely affect the Companies financial performance and/or impair the Companies ability to execute the business plan for the project as scheduled. Further, an inability to obtain financing or otherwise provide liquidity for the projects on acceptable terms could negatively affect theCompanies financial condition, cash flows, the projects anticipated financial results and/or impair the Companies ability to execute the business plan for the projects as scheduled. The Companies operations and construction activities are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations which imposesignificant compliance costs to the Companies. The Companies operations and construction activities are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality,waste management, natural resources, and health and safety. Compliance with these legal requirements requires the Companies to commit significant capital toward permitting, emission fees, environmental monitoring, installation and operation ofenvironmental control equipment and purchase of allowances and/or offsets. Additionally, the Companies could be responsible for expenses relating to remediation and containment obligations, including at sites where they have been identified by aregulatory agency as a potentially responsible party. Expenditures relating to environmental compliance have been significant in the past, and the Companies expect that they will remain significant in the future. Certain facilities have becomeuneconomical to operate and have been shut down, converted to new fuel types or sold. These types of events could occur again in the future. We expect that existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and/or new laws may be adopted including regulation of GHG emissionswhich could have an impact on the Companies business. Risks relating to expected regulation of GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units are discussed below. In addition, further regulation of air quality and GHGemissions under the CAA have been imposed on the natural gas sector, including rules to limit methane leakage. The Companies are also subject to federal water and waste regulations, including regulations concerning cooling water intake structures,coal combustion by-product handling and disposal  31   practices, wastewater discharges from steam electric generating stations, management and disposal of hydraulic fracturing fluids and the potential further regulation of polychlorinated biphenyls. Compliance costs cannot be estimated with certainty due to the inability to predict the requirements and timing of implementation of anynew environmental rules or regulations. Other factors which affect the ability to predict future environmental expenditures with certainty include the difficulty in estimating clean-up costs and quantifyingliabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liabilities on all responsible parties. However, such expenditures, if material, could make the Companies facilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment ofassets, or otherwise adversely affect the Companies results of operations, financial performance or liquidity.  Any additionalfederal and/or state requirements imposed on energy companies mandating limitations on GHG emissions or requiring efficiency improvements may result in compliance costs that alone or in combination could make some of theCompanies electric generation units or natural gas facilities uneconomical to maintain or operate. The EPA has proposed the Affordable Clean Energy rule targeted at reducingCO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired power generation facilities as a replacement for the Clean Power Plan which has been stayed. The Affordable Clean Energy rule would require statesto develop plans within three years of the final rule to implement these performance standards. States are also contemplating regulations regarding GHG emissions. For example, the Virginia General Assembly recently considered legislation which wouldauthorize the state to directly join the RGGI program as a full participant. Compliance with the proposed Affordable Clean Energy rule or other federal or state carbon regulations is expected to require increasing the energy efficiency of equipmentat facilities, committing significant capital toward carbon reduction programs, purchase of allowances and/or emission rate credits, fuel switching, and/or retirement of high-emitting generation facilities and potential replacement withlower-emitting generation facilities. Given these developments and uncertainties, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power cannot estimate the aggregate effect of such requirements on their results of operations, financial condition or their customers.However, such expenditures, if material, could make Dominion Energy and Virginia Powers generation facilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect Dominion Energy or Virginia Powersresults of operations, financial performance or liquidity.  There are also potential impacts on Dominion Energy and Dominion EnergyGas natural gas businesses as federal or state GHG regulations may require GHG emission reductions from the natural gas sector which, in addition to resulting in increased costs, could affect demand for natural gas. Additionally, GHGrequirements could result in increased demand for energy conservation and renewable products, which could impact the natural gas businesses. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power are subject to risks associated with the disposal and storage of coal ash.Dominion Energy and Virginia Power historically produced and continue to produce coal ash, or CCRs, as a by-product of their coal-fired generation operations. The ash is stored and managed inimpoundments (ash ponds) and landfills located at 11 different facilities, eight of which are at Virginia Power. The EPA has issued regulations concerning the management and storage of CCRs, which Virginia has adopted. These CCR regulations requireDominion Energy and Virginia Power to make additional capital expenditures and increase operating and maintenance expenses. In addition, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power will incur expenses and other costs associated with closing, correctiveaction and ongoing monitoring of certain ash ponds. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power also may face litigation concerning their coal ash facilities. Further, while Dominion Energy and Virginia Power operate their ash ponds and landfills in compliance with applicable state safetyregulations, a release of coal ash with a significant environmental impact, such as the Dan River ash basin release by a neighboring utility, could result in remediation costs, civil and/or criminal penalties, claims, litigation, increasedregulation and compliance costs, and reputational damage, and could impact the financial condition of Dominion Energy and/or Virginia Power. The Companies operations are subject to operational hazards, equipment failures, supply chain disruptions and personnel issues whichcould negatively affect the Companies. Operation of the Companies facilities involves risk, including the risk of potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure, fuel supply, pipeline integrity ortransportation disruptions, accidents, labor disputes or work stoppages by employees, acts of terrorism or sabotage, construction delays or cost overruns, shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material and labor, operational restrictionsresulting from environmental limitations and governmental interventions, changes to the environment and performance below expected levels. The Companies businesses are dependent upon sophisticated information technology systems and networkinfrastructure, the failure of which could prevent them from accomplishing critical business functions. Because the Companies transmission facilities, pipelines and other facilities are interconnected with those of third parties, the operationof their facilities and pipelines could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties. Operation of the Companies facilities below expected capacity levels could result in lost revenues and increased expenses, includinghigher maintenance costs. Unplanned outages of the Companies facilities and extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of the Companies business.Unplanned outages typically increase the Companies operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce their revenues as a result of selling less output or may require the Companies to incur significant costs as a result of operating higher costunits or obtaining replacement output from third parties in the open market to satisfy forward energy and capacity or other contractual obligations. Moreover, if the Companies are unable to perform their contractual obligations, penalties orliability for damages could result.  In addition, there are many risks associated with the Companies operations and thetransportation, storage and processing of natural gas and NGLs, including nuclear accidents, fires, explosions, uncontrolled release of natural gas and otherenviron-  32       mental hazards, pole strikes, electric contact cases, the collision of third party equipment with pipelines and avian and other wildlife impacts. Such incidents could result in loss of human lifeor injuries among employees, customers or the public in general, environmental pollution, damage or destruction of facilities or business interruptions and associated public or employee safety impacts, loss of revenues, increased liabilities,heightened regulatory scrutiny and reputational risk. Further, the location of pipelines and storage facilities, or generation, transmission, substations and distribution facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercialbusiness centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks.  Dominion Energy and VirginiaPower have substantial ownership interests in and operate nuclear generating units; as a result, each may incur substantial costs and liabilities. Dominion Energy and Virginia Powers nuclear facilities are subject to operational,environmental, health and financial risks such as the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel, the ability to dispose of such spent nuclear fuel, the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning,limitations on the amounts and types of insurance available, potential operational liabilities and extended outages, the costs of replacement power, the costs of maintenance and the costs of securing the facilities against possible terroristattacks. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power maintain decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage to minimize the financial exposure to these risks; however, it is possible that future decommissioning costs could exceed amounts in thedecommissioning trusts and/or damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. If Dominion Energy and Virginia Powers decommissioning trust funds are insufficient, and they are not allowed to recover the additional costs incurred throughinsurance or regulatory mechanisms, their results of operations could be negatively impacted.  Dominion Energy and Virginia Powersnuclear facilities are also subject to complex government regulation which could negatively impact their results of operations. The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation ofnuclear generating facilities. In the event of noncompliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines, set license conditions, shut down a nuclear unit, or take some combination of these actions, depending on its assessment of the severity of thesituation, until compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require Dominion Energy and Virginia Power to make substantial expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, although the Companies have no reasonto anticipate a serious nuclear incident at their plants, if an incident did occur, it could materially and adversely affect their results of operations and/or financial condition. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world, suchas the nuclear events in Japan in 2011, could cause the NRC to adopt increased safety regulations or otherwise limit or restrict the operation or licensing of domestic nuclear units. Sustained declines in natural gas and NGL prices have resulted in, and could result in further, curtailments of third-partyproducers drilling programs, delaying the production of volumes of natural gas and NGLs that Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas gather, process, and transport and reducing the value of NGLs retained by Dominion Energy Gas,which may adversely affect Dominion Energy and DominionEnergy Gas revenues and earnings. Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas obtain their supply of natural gas and NGLs from numerous third-party producers. Mostproducers are under no obligation to deliver a specific quantity of natural gas or NGLs to Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas facilities. A number of other factors could reduce the volumes of natural gas and NGLs available to DominionEnergy and Dominion Energy Gas pipelines and other assets. Increased regulation of energy extraction activities could result in reductions in drilling for new natural gas wells, which could decrease the volumes of natural gas supplied toDominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas. Producers with direct commodity price exposure face liquidity constraints, which could present a credit risk to Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas. Producers could shift their production activities toregions outside Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas footprint. In addition, the extent of natural gas reserves and the rate of production from such reserves may be less than anticipated. If producers were to decrease the supply of naturalgas or NGLs to Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas systems and facilities for any reason, Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas could experience lower revenues to the extent they are unable to replace the lost volumes on similar terms.In addition, Dominion Energy Gas revenue from processing and fractionation operations largely results from the sale of commodities at market prices. Dominion Energy Gas receives the wet gas product from producers and may retain theextracted NGLs as compensation for its services. This exposes Dominion Energy Gas to commodity price risk for the value of the spread between the NGL products and natural gas, and relative changes in these prices could adversely impact DominionEnergy Gas results.  Dominion Energys merchant power business operates in a challenging market, which could adverselyaffect its results of operations and future growth. The success of Dominion Energys merchant power business depends upon favorable market conditions including the ability to sell power at prices sufficient to cover its operating costs.Dominion Energy operates in active wholesale markets that expose it to price volatility for electricity and nuclear fuel as well as the credit risk of counterparties. Dominion Energy attempts to manage its price risk by entering into hedgingtransactions, including short-term and long-term fixed price sales and purchase contracts.  In these wholesale markets, the spot marketprice of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the cost of supplying the next unit of electricity to the market during that hour. In many cases, the next unit of electricity supplied would be provided by generating stations thatconsume fossil fuels, primarily natural gas. Consequently, the open market wholesale price for electricity generally reflects the cost of natural gas plus the cost to convert the fuel to electricity. Therefore, changes in the price of natural gasgenerally affect the open market wholesale price of electricity. To the extent Dominion Energy does not enter into long-term power purchase agreements or otherwise effectively hedge its output, these changes in market prices could adversely affectits financial results.  Dominion Energy purchases nuclear fuel primarily under long-term contracts. Dominion Energy is exposed to nuclearfuel cost volatility for the portion of its nuclear fuel obtained through short-term contracts or on the spot market, including as a result  33   of market supply shortages. Nuclear fuel prices can be volatile and the price that can be obtained for power produced may not change at the same rate as nuclear fuel costs, thus adverselyimpacting Dominion Energys financial results. In addition, in the event that any of the merchant generation facilities experience a forced outage, Dominion Energy may not receive the level of revenue it anticipated. The Companies financial results can be adversely affected by various factors driving supply and demand for electricity and gas andrelated services. Technological advances required by federal laws mandate new levels of energy efficiency in end-use devices, including lighting, furnaces and electric heat pumps and could lead to declinesin per capita energy consumption. Additionally, certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by a fixed date. Further, Virginia Powers business modelis premised upon the cost efficiency of the production, transmission and distribution of large-scale centralized utility generation. However, advances in distributed generation technologies, such as solar cells, gas microturbines and fuel cells, maymake these alternative generation methods competitive with large-scale utility generation, and change how customers acquire or use our services. Virginia Power has an exclusive franchise to serve retail electric customers in Virginia. However,Virginias Retail Access Statutes allow certain Power Generation customers exceptions to this franchise. As market conditions change, Virginia Powers customers may further pursue exceptions and Virginia Powers exclusive franchisemay erode.  Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due to customer adoption of energy efficient technology,conservation, distributed generation, regional economic conditions, or the impact of additional compliance obligations, unless substantially offset through regulatory cost allocations, could adversely impact the value of the Companies businessactivities.  Dominion Energy Gas has experienced a decline in demand for certain of its processing services due to competing facilitiesoperating in nearby areas.  Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas may not be able to maintain, renew or replace their existingportfolio of customer contracts successfully, or on favorable terms. Upon contract expiration, customers may not elect to re-contract with Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas as a result of a varietyof factors, including the amount of competition in the industry, changes in the price of natural gas, their level of satisfaction with Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas services, the extent to which Dominion Energy and Dominion EnergyGas are able to successfully execute their business plans and the effect of the regulatory framework on customer demand. The failure to replace any such customer contracts on similar terms or with counterparties with similar credit profiles couldresult in a loss of revenue for Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas and related decreases in their earnings and cash flows. Certain of Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas gas pipeline services are subject to long-term, fixed-price negotiatedrate contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if the cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts. Under FERC policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to sign acontract for service at a negotiated rate which may be above orbelow the FERC regulated, cost-based recourse rate for that service. These negotiated rate contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased costs which could beproduced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services. Any shortfall of revenue as a result of these negotiated rate contracts could decrease Dominion Energy and Dominion EnergyGas earnings and cash flows.  Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas conduct certain operations through joint ventures that maylimit our operational flexibility. Certain operations are conducted through joint venture arrangements, such as Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Iroquois, to which Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas havesignificant influence but do not control the operations of such entities. The joint ventures operate in accordance with the applicable governing provisions of each entity. Accordingly, Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas may have limited abilityto influence or control certain day to day activities affecting the operations and do have not unilateral control over decisions that may have a material financial impact on the joint venture participants. Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas aredependent upon third parties satisfying their respective obligations, including, as applicable, funding of their required share of capital expenditures. In addition, Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas may be subject to restrictions orlimitations on their ability to sell or transfer their interests in the joint venture arrangements. The third-party participants in the joint ventures have their own interests and objectives which may differ from those of Dominion Energy andDominion Energy Gas. Accordingly, any disputes amongst the joint venture partners may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses. Exposure to counterparty performance may adversely affect the Companies financial results of operations. TheCompanies are exposed to credit risks of their counterparties and the risk that one or more counterparties may fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations, including but not limited to payment for services. Some of DominionEnergys operations are conducted through less than wholly-owned subsidiaries, as noted above. Counterparties could fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations for a number of reasons, including the effect of regulations ontheir operations. Defaults or failure to perform by customers, suppliers, contractors, joint venture partners, financial institutions or other third parties may adversely affect the Companies financial results. Dominion Energy is exposed to counterparty credit risk relating to the terminal services agreements for the Liquefaction Project. While thecounterparties obligations are supported by parental guarantees and letters of credit, there is no assurance that such credit support would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations in the event of a counterparty default. In addition, if acontroversy arises under either agreement resulting in a judgment in Dominion Energys favor, Dominion Energy may need to seek to enforce a final U.S. court judgment in a foreign tribunal, which could involve a lengthy process. Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of Dominion Energy and VirginiaPowers decommissioning trust funds and Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas benefit plan assets or increase Dominion Energy and DominionEnergy Gas liabilities, which could then require significant additional funding. The performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trusts to  34       satisfy future obligations to decommission Dominion Energy and Virginia Powers nuclear plants and under Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas pension and other postretirementbenefit plans. The Companies have significant obligations in these areas and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below expected return rates. With respect to decommissioning trust funds, a decline in the market value of these assets may increase the funding requirements of theobligations to decommission Dominion Energy and Virginia Powers nuclear plants or require additional NRC-approved funding assurance. A decline in the market value of the assets held in trusts to satisfy future obligations under Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gaspension and other postretirement benefit plans may increase the funding requirements under such plans. Additionally, changes in interest rates will affect the liabilities under Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas pension and otherpostretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in mortality assumptions, may alsoincrease the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  If thedecommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets are negatively impacted by market fluctuations or other factors, the Companies results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows could be negatively affected. The use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses and liquidity constraints. The Companies use derivative instruments,including futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs, to manage commodity, currency and financial market risks. In addition, Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas purchase and sell commodity-based contracts for hedging purposes. The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted into law in July 2010 in an effort to improve regulation of financial markets. The CEA, as amended by Title VIIof the Dodd-Frank Act, requires certain over-the-counter derivatives, or swaps, to be cleared through a derivatives clearing organization and, if the swap is subject toa clearing requirement, to be executed on a designated contract market or swap execution facility. Non-financial entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end users,may elect the end-user exception to the CEAs clearing requirements. The Companies have elected to exempt their swaps from the CEAs clearing requirements. If, as a result of changes to therulemaking process, the Companies derivative activities are not exempted from the clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, the Companies could be subject to higher costs due to decreased market liquidity or increased margin payments.In addition, the Companies swap dealer counterparties may attempt to pass-through additional trading costs in connection with changes to or the elimination of rulemaking that implements Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. Changing rating agency requirements could negatively affect the Companies growth and business strategy. In order to maintainappropriate credit ratings to obtain needed credit at a reasonable cost in light of existing or future rating agency requirements, the Companies may find it necessary to take steps or change theirbusiness plans in ways that may adversely affect their growth and earnings. A reduction in the Companies credit ratings could result in an increase in borrowing costs, loss of access tocertain markets, or both, thus adversely affecting operating results and could require the Companies to post additional collateral in connection with some of its price risk management activities. An inability to access financial markets could adversely affect the execution of the Companies business plans. The Companies relyon access to short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as significant sources of funding and liquidity for business plans with increasing capital expenditure needs, normal working capital and collateral requirements related to hedgesof future sales and purchases of energy-related commodities. Deterioration in the Companies creditworthiness, as evaluated by credit rating agencies or otherwise, or declines in market reputation either for the Companies or their industry ingeneral, or general financial market disruptions outside of the Companies control could increase their cost of borrowing or restrict their ability to access one or more financial markets. Further market disruptions could stem from delays inthe current economic recovery, the bankruptcy of an unrelated company, general market disruption due to general credit market or political events, or the failure of financial institutions on which the Companies rely. Increased costs and restrictionson the Companies ability to access financial markets may be severe enough to affect their ability to execute their business plans as scheduled. Potential changes in accounting practices may adversely affect the Companies financial results. The Companies cannot predict theimpact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on public companies in general, the energy industry or their operations specifically. New accounting standards could be issued that could change the way they record revenues,expenses, assets and liabilities. These changes in accounting standards could adversely affect earnings or could increase liabilities. War, acts and threats of terrorism, intentional acts and other significant events could adversely affect the Companies operations.The Companies cannot predict the impact that any future terrorist attacks may have on the energy industry in general, or on the Companies business in particular. Any retaliatory military strikes or sustained military campaign may affectthe Companies operations in unpredictable ways, such as changes in insurance markets and disruptions of fuel supplies and markets. In addition, the Companies infrastructure facilities, including projects under construction, could bedirect targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror. For example, there have been multiple instances of vandalism or attempted sabotage on third-party oil and gas pipelines either under construction or in operation. Furthermore, thephysical compromise of the Companies facilities could adversely affect the Companies ability to manage these facilities effectively. Instability in financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, intentional acts, pandemic, creditcrises, recession or other factors could result in a significant decline in the U.S. economy and increase the cost of insurance coverage. This could negatively impact the Companies results of operations and financial condition. Hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair the Companies operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information, damagethe reputation of the Companies and otherwise have an adverse effect on the Companies business.  35   The Companies own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems. Further, the computer systems that run theCompanies facilities are not completely isolated from external networks. There appears to be an increasing level of activity, sophistication and maturity of threat actors, in particular nation state actors, that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulkpower system and the U.S. gas transmission or distribution system. Such parties could view the Companies computer systems, software or networks as attractive targets for cyber attack. For example, malware has been designed to target softwarethat runs the nations critical infrastructure such as power transmission grids and gas pipelines. In addition, the Companies businesses require that they and their vendors collect and maintain sensitive customer data, as well asconfidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss.  A successful cyber attack on the systemsthat control the Companies electric generation, electric or gas transmission or distribution assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing the Companies from serving customers or collecting revenues. The breach of certainbusiness systems could affect the Companies ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage andcould lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to the Companies reputation. In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidentialdata at the Companies or one of their vendors could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring. While the Companies maintain property and casualty insurance, along with other contractualprovisions, that may cover certain damage caused by potential cyber incidents, all damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available. For these reasons, a significant cyber incidentcould materially and adversely affect the Companies business, financial condition and results of operations.  Failure to attractand retain key executive officers and an appropriately qualified workforce could have an adverse effect on the Companies operations. The Companies business strategy is dependent on their ability to recruit, retain and motivateemployees. The Companies key executive officers are the CEO, CFO and presidents and those responsible for financial, operational, legal, regulatory and accounting functions. Competition for skilled management employees in these areas of theCompanies business operations is high. Certain events, such as an aging workforce, mismatch of skill set, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include lack of resources,loss of knowledge base and the length of time required for skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacementemployees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employees, or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the Companies business. Inaddition, certain specialized knowledge is required of the Companies technical employees for construction andoper-ation of transmission, generation and distribution assets. The Companies inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect their business and future operating results. Following the SCANA Combination, Dominion Energy may be unable to successfully integrate SCANAs businesses.Dominion Energy is devoting significant management attention and resources to integrating SCANAs businesses. While Dominion Energy has assumed that a certain level of transaction and integration expenseswill be incurred, there are a number of factors beyond its control that could affect the total amount or the timing of its integration expenses. Potential difficulties Dominion Energy may encounter in the integration process include the following: The complexities associated with integrating SCANA, including its utility businesses, while at the same time continuing to provide consistent, high quality services;  The complexities of integrating a company with different markets and customers;  The inability to attract and retain key employees;  Potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the SCANA Combination;  Difficulties in managing political and regulatory conditions related to SCANAs utility businesses;  The moratorium on filing requests for adjustments in SCE&Gs base electric rates until May 2020 with no changes in rates until January 1, 2021, which limits Dominion Energys ability to recoverincreases in non-fuel related costs of electric operations for SCE&Gs customers;  The stipulation agreement approved by the North Carolina Commission, which provides for a rate moratorium at PSNC until November 1, 2021, with certain exceptions; and  Performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of Dominion Energy managements attention caused by integrating SCANAs businesses. For these reasons, it is possible that the integration process could result in the distraction of Dominion Energys management, thedisruption of Dominion Energys ongoing business or inconsistencies in its services, standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect the ability of Dominion Energy to maintain or establish relationships withcurrent and prospective customers, vendors and employees or could otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of Dominion Energy. Dominion Energy may be materially adversely affected by negative publicity related to the SCANA Combination and inconnection with other related matters, including the abandonment of the NND Project. From time to time, political and public sentiment in connection with the merger and in connection with other matters, including the abandonment of the NNDProject, may result in a significant amount of adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting Dominion Energy. Adverse press coverage and other adverse statements, whether or not driven by political or public sentiment, mayalso result in investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in legal claims. Responding to these investigations and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceedings, as well as responding to andaddressing adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements, can divert the time and effort of senior management from the management of Dominion Energys business.  36       Addressing any adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny or enforcement or other legalproceedings is time consuming and expensive and, regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made, can have a negative impact on the reputation of Dominion Energy, on the morale and performance of their employees and on theirrelationships with their respective regulators, customers and commercial counterparties. It may also have a negative impact on their ability to take timely advantage of various business and market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects ofnegative publicity, and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may have a material adverse effect on Dominion Energys business, financial condition and results of operations. The SCANA Combination may not be accretive to operating earnings and may cause dilution to Dominion Energys earnings per share, whichmay negatively affect the market price of Dominion Energy common stock. Dominion Energy currently anticipates that the SCANA Combination will be immediately accretive to Dominion Energys forecasted operating earnings per share on astandalone basis. This expectation is based on preliminary estimates, which may materially change. Dominion Energy may encounter additional transaction and integration-related costs, may fail to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the mergeror be subject to other factors that affect preliminary estimates or its ability to realize operational efficiencies. Any of these factors could cause a decrease in Dominion Energys operating earnings per share or decrease or delay the expectedaccretive effect of the merger and contribute to a decrease in the price of Dominion Energys common stock. Dominion Energy expects the initial effect of the SCANA Combination on its GAAP earnings will be a decrease in such earnings due to theanticipated charges for refunds to SCE&G customers and transaction and transition costs.  Through the SCANA Combination,Dominion Energy acquired SCANA and SCE&G which are subject to numerous legal proceedings and ongoing governmental investigations and examinations. SCANA and SCE&G are defendants in numerous federal and state legal proceedings andgovernmental investigations relating to the decision to abandon construction at theNND Project. Among other things, the lawsuits and investigations allege misrepresentation, failure to properly manage the NND Project, unfair trade practices and violation of anti-trust laws. Theplaintiffs seek a judgment that SCE&G may not charge its customers for any past or continuing costs of the NND Project, among other remedies. Additionally, SCANA and SCE&G are defendants in federal and state legal proceedings relating to the SCANA Combination. Among other things,the lawsuits allege breaches of various fiduciary duties. Remedies sought include rescinding the SCANA Combination.  The outcome of theselegal proceedings, investigations and examinations is uncertain and may adversely affect Dominion Energys financial condition or results of operation. Dominion Energy has goodwill and other intangible assets on its balance sheet, and these amounts will increase as a result of the SCANACombination. If its goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired in the future, Dominion Energy may be required to record a significant, non-cash charge to earnings and reduce itsshareholders equity. Dominion Energy will record as goodwill the excess of the purchase price paid by Dominion Energy over the fair value of SCANAs assets and liabilities as determined for financial accounting purposes in itsConsolidated Balance Sheet beginning in the first quarter of 2019. Under GAAP, intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not berecoverable. If Dominion Energys intangible assets, including goodwill as a result of the SCANA Combination, are determined to be impaired in the future, Dominion Energy may be required to record a significant,non-cash charge to earnings during the period in which the impairment is determined.    "
10,D,DOMINION ENERGY INC,2018-02-27,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
  TheCompanies businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyond their control. A number of these factors have been identified below. Forother factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement or projection contained in this report, see Forward-Looking Statements in Item 7. MD&A. The Companies results of operations can be affected by changes in the weather. Fluctuations in weather can affect demand for theCompanies services. For example, milder than normal weather can reduce demand for electricity and gas transmission and distribution services. In addition, severe weather, including hurricanes, winter storms, earthquakes, floods and othernatural disasters can disrupt operation of the Companies facilities and cause service outages, production delays and property damage that require incurring additional expenses. Changes in weather conditions can result in reduced water levelsor changes in water temperatures that could adversely affect operations at some of the Companies power stations. Furthermore, the Companies operations could be adversely affected and their physical plant placed at greater risk of damageshould changes in global climate produce, among other possible conditions, unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, abnormal levels of precipitation and, for operationslocated on or near coastlines, a change in sea level or sea temperatures.  The rates of Dominion Energys and Dominion EnergyGas gas transmission and distribution operations and Virginia Powers electric transmission, distribution and generation operations are subject to regulatory review. Revenue provided by Virginia Powers electric transmission,distribution and generation operations and Dominion Energys and Dominion Energy Gas gas transmission and distribution operations is based primarily on rates approved by state and federal regulatory agencies. However, certain large scalecustomers are able to enter into negotiated-rate contracts rather than pay cost-of-service rates which are subject to regulatory review. The profitability of thesebusinesses is dependent on their ability, through the rates that they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on their capital investment.Virginia Powers wholesale rates for electric transmission service are updated on anannual basis through operation of a FERC-approved formula rate mechanism. Through this mechanism, Virginia Powers wholesale rates for electric transmission reflect the estimatedcost-of-service for each calendar year. The difference in the estimated cost-of-serviceand actual cost-of-service for each calendar year is included as an adjustment to the wholesale rates for electric transmission service in a subsequent calendar year.These wholesale rates are subject to FERC review and prospective adjustment in the event that customers and/or interested state commissions file a complaint with FERC and are able to demonstrate that Virginia Powers wholesale revenuerequirement is no longer just and reasonable. They are also subject to retroactive corrections to the extent that the formula rate was not properly populated with the actual costs. Similarly, various rates and charges assessed by Dominion Energys and Dominion Energy Gas gas transmission businesses are subjectto review by FERC. In addition, the rates of Dominion Energys and Dominion Energy Gas gas distribution businesses are subject to state regulatory review in the jurisdictions in which they operate. A failure by Dominion Energy or DominionEnergy Gas to support these rates could result in rate decreases from current rate levels, which could adversely affect Dominion Energys and Dominion Energy Gas results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Virginia Powers base rates, terms and conditions for generation and distribution services to customers in Virginia are reviewed by theVirginia Commission on a biennial basis in a proceeding that involves the determination of Virginia Powers actual earned ROE during a combined two-year historic test period, and the determination ofVirginia Powers authorized ROE prospectively. Under certain circumstances described in the Regulation Act, Virginia Power may be required to share a portion of its earnings with customers through a refund process. Legislation signed by the Virginia Governor in February 2015 suspends biennial reviews for the five successive12-month test periods beginning January 1, 2015 and ending December 31, 2019, and no changes will be made to Virginia Powers existing base rates until at least December 1, 2022. Duringthis period, Virginia Power bears the risk of any severe weather events and natural disasters, the risk of asset impairments related to the early retirement of any generation facilities due to the implementation of environmental regulations, as wellas an increase in general operating and financing costs, and Virginia Power may not recover its associated costs through increases to base rates. If Virginia Power incurs any such significant additional expenses during this period, Virginia Powermay not be able to recover its costs and/or earn a reasonable return on capital investment, which could negatively affect Virginia Powers future earnings. Virginia Powers retail electric base rates for bundled generation, transmission, and distribution services to customers in NorthCarolina are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to NorthCarolina statutes, and the rules and procedures of the North Carolina Commission. If retail electric earnings exceed the returns established by the North Carolina Commission, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction bythe North Carolina Commission, which may decrease Virginia Powers future earnings. Additionally, if the North Carolina Commission does not allow recovery through  27Table of Contents   base rates, on a timely basis, of costs incurred in providing service, Virginia Powers future earnings could be negatively impacted. Governmental officials, stakeholders and advocacy groups may challenge these regulatory reviews. Such challenges may lengthen the time,complexity and costs associated with such regulatory reviews.  The Companies are subject to complex governmental regulation, includingtax regulation, that could adversely affect their results of operations and subject the Companies to monetary penalties. The Companies operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation and require numerous permits,approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies. Such laws and regulations govern the terms and conditions of the services we offer, our relationships with affiliates, protection of our critical electric infrastructure assets andpipeline safety, among other matters. These operations are also subject to legislation governing taxation at the federal, state and local level. They must also comply with environmental legislation and associated regulations. Management believesthat the necessary approvals have been obtained for existing operations and that the business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws. The Companies businesses are subject to regulatory regimes which could result in substantialmonetary penalties if any of the Companies is found not to be in compliance, including mandatory reliability standards and interaction in the wholesale markets. New laws or regulations, the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws orregulations, changes in enforcement practices of regulators, or penalties imposed for non-compliance with existing laws or regulations may result in substantial additional expense. Recent legislative andregulatory changes that are impacting the Companies include the 2017 Tax Reform Act and tariffs imposed on imported solar panels by the U.S. government in 2018. The 2017 Tax Reform Act could have a material impact on our operations, cash flows, and financial results.Reductions in the estimated annual cost-of-service effect (commonly referred to as the gross-up factor) due to the reduction in the corporate income tax rates to 21% under the provisions of the 2017 TaxReform Act could result in amounts currently collected from utility customers to be refundable to such customers, generally through reductions in rates. In addition, the Companies regulators may require the reduction in accumulated deferredincome tax balances under the provisions of the 2017 Tax Reform Act to be shared with customers, generally through reductions in future rates. The 2017 Tax Reform Act includes provisions that stipulate how these excess deferred taxes may be passedback to customers for certain accelerated tax depreciation benefits. Potential refunds of other deferred taxes may be determined by our federal and state regulators. The 2017 Tax Reform Act could have a material impact on Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy GasFERC-regulated gas operations including rates charged to customers. In light of the reduction in the income tax rate in the 2017 Tax Reform Act, our FERC-regulated gas subsidiaries are subject to an increased risk of FERCinitiating industry-wide proceedings under Section 5 of the Natural Gas Act to have interstate pipelines substantiate rates charged for transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce, when viewed holistically, are justand reasonable taking into account the effects of tax reform and all other drivers. It is unclear if FERC will mandate a one-time rate reset or Section 5 rate case for Dominion Energy and DominionEnergy Gas regulated subsidiaries; however, states as well as customers have petitioned FERC to request changes in rates as a result of tax reform. The interpretation of provisions of the 2017 Tax Reform Act that take effect in 2018 may significantly impact our operations. The 2017Tax Reform Act contains provisions that limit the deductibility of interest expense. The new provision generally limits the interest deduction on business interest to (1) business interest income, plus (2) 30 percent of the taxpayersadjusted taxable income. Business interest and business interest income is defined as that allocable to a trade or business and not investment interest and income. Regulated public utilities are not subject to this interest limitation; howeverDominion Energy is a consolidated group with both regulated and merchant lines of businesses. The U.S. Department of Treasury has been tasked with providing guidance on applying the interest limitation to consolidated groups, such as DominionEnergy, but it is unclear when that guidance may be issued, or whether that guidance could result in a disallowance of a portion of our interest deductions in the future. Dominion Energy and Virginia Powers generation business may be negatively affected by possible FERC actions that could changemarket design in the wholesale markets or affect pricing rules or revenue calculations in the RTO markets. Dominion Energy and Virginia Powers generation stations operating in RTO markets sell capacity, energy and ancillary servicesinto wholesale electricity markets regulated by FERC. The wholesale markets allow these generation stations to take advantage of market price opportunities, but also expose them to market risk. Properly functioning competitive wholesale marketsdepend upon FERCs continuation of clearly identified market rules. From time to time FERC may investigate and authorize RTOs to make changes in market design. FERC also periodically reviews Dominion Energys authority to sell atmarket-based rates. Material changes by FERC to the design of the wholesale markets or its interpretation of market rules, Dominion Energy or Virginia Powers authority to sell power at market-based rates, or changes to pricing rules or rulesinvolving revenue calculations, could adversely impact the future results of Dominion Energy or Virginia Powers generation business. For example, in July 2015, FERC approved changes to PJMs Reliability Pricing Model capacity marketestablishing a new Capacity Performance Resource product. This product offers the potential for higher capacity prices but can also impose significant economic penalties on generator owners such as Virginia Power for failure to perform duringperiods when electricity is in high demand. In addition, there have been changes to the interpretation and application of FERCs market manipulation rules. A failure to comply with these rules could lead to civil and criminal penalties. The Companies infrastructure build and expansion plans often require regulatory approval before construction can commence. TheCompanies may not complete facility construction, pipeline, conversion or other infrastructure projects that they commence, or they may complete projects on materially different terms or timing than initially anticipated, and they may not beable to achieve the intended benefits of any such project, if completed. Several facility construction, pipeline, electric transmission line, expansion, conversion and other infrastructure projects have been announced and additional projects  28    Table of Contents   may be considered in the future. The Companies compete for projects with companies of varying size and financial capabilities, including some that may have competitive advantages. Commencingconstruction on announced and future projects may require approvals from applicable state and federal agencies, and such approvals could include mitigation costs which may be material to the Companies. Projects may not be able to be completed ontime as a result of weather conditions, delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory approvals, delays in obtaining key materials, labor difficulties, difficulties with partners or potential partners, a decline in the credit strength ofcounterparties or vendors, or other factors beyond the Companies control. Even if facility construction, pipeline, expansion, electric transmission line, conversion and other infrastructure projects are completed, the total costs of theprojects may be higher than anticipated and the performance of the business of the Companies following completion of the projects may not meet expectations. Start-up and operational issues can arise inconnection with the commencement of commercial operations at our facilities, including but not limited to commencement of commercial operations at our power generation facilities following expansions and the Liquefaction Project. Such issuesmay include failure to meet specific operating parameters, which may require adjustments to meet or amend these operating parameters. Additionally, the Companies may not be able to timely and effectively integrate the projects into their operationsand such integration may result in unforeseen operating difficulties or unanticipated costs. Further, regulators may disallow recovery of some of the costs of a project if they are deemed not to be prudently incurred. Any of these or other factorscould adversely affect the Companies ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the facility construction, pipeline, electric transmission line, expansion, conversion and other infrastructure projects. The development, construction and commissioning of several large-scale infrastructure projects simultaneously involves significantexecution risk. The Companies are currently simultaneously developing, constructing or commissioning several major projects, including the Liquefaction Project, the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project, the Supply Header project, Greensville Countyand multiple DETI projects, which together help contribute to the over $25 billion in capital expenditures planned by the Companies through 2022. Several of the Companies key projects are increasingly large-scale, complex and beingconstructed in constrained geographic areas or in difficult terrain, for example, the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project. The advancement of the Companies ventures is also affected by the interventions, litigation or other activities ofstakeholder and advocacy groups, some of which oppose natural gas-related and energy infrastructure projects. For example, certain landowners and stakeholder groups oppose the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project,which could impede construction activities or the acquisition of rights-of-way and other land rights on a timely basis or on acceptable terms. Given that these projectsprovide the foundation for the Companies strategic growth plan, if the Companies are unable to obtain or maintain the required approvals, develop the necessary technical expertise, allocate and coordinate sufficient resources, adhere tobudgets and timelines, effectively handle public outreach efforts, or otherwise fail to successfully execute the projects, there could be an adverse impact to the Companiesfinancial position, results of operations and cash flows. For example, while Dominion Energy has received the required approvals to commence construction of the Liquefaction Project from the DOE,all DOE export licenses are subject to review and possible withdrawal should the DOE conclude that such export authorization is no longer in the public interest. Failure to comply with regulatory approval conditions or an adverse ruling in anyfuture litigation could adversely affect the Companies ability to execute their business plan.  The Companies are dependent on theircontractors for the successful and timely completion of large-scale infrastructure projects. The construction of such projects is expected to take several years, is typically confined within a limited geographic area or difficult terrain and couldbe subject to delays, cost overruns, labor disputes and other factors that could cause the total cost of the project to exceed the anticipated amount and adversely affect the Companies financial performance and/or impair the Companiesability to execute the business plan for the project as scheduled.  Further, an inability to obtain financing or otherwise provideliquidity for the projects on acceptable terms could negatively affect the Companies financial condition, cash flows, the projects anticipated financial results and/or impair the Companies ability to execute the business plan forthe projects as scheduled.  The Companies operations and construction activities are subject to a number of environmental lawsand regulations which impose significant compliance costs to the Companies. The Companies operations and construction activities are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating toair quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources, and health and safety. Compliance with these legal requirements requires the Companies to commit significant capital toward permitting, emission fees, environmental monitoring,installation and operation of environmental control equipment and purchase of allowances and/or offsets. Additionally, the Companies could be responsible for expenses relating to remediation and containment obligations, including at sites where theyhave been identified by a regulatory agency as a potentially responsible party. Expenditures relating to environmental compliance have been significant in the past, and the Companies expect that they will remain significant in the future. Certainfacilities have become uneconomical to operate and have been shut down, converted to new fuel types or sold. These types of events could occur again in the future. We expect that existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and/or new laws may be adopted including regulation of GHG emissionswhich could have an impact on the Companies business. Risks relating to expected regulation of GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units are discussed below. In addition, further regulation of air quality and GHGemissions under the CAA have been imposed on the natural gas sector, including rules to limit methane leakage. The Companies are also subject to federal water and waste regulations, including regulations concerning cooling water intake structures,coal combustion by-product handling and disposal practices, wastewater discharges from steam electric generating stations, management and disposal of hydraulic fracturing fluids and the potential furtherregulation of polychlorinated biphenyls.   29Table of Contents   Compliance costs cannot be estimated with certainty due to the inability to predict therequirements and timing of implementation of any new environmental rules or regulations. Other factors which affect the ability to predict future environmental expenditures with certainty include the difficulty in estimating clean-up costs and quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liabilities on all responsible parties. However, such expenditures, if material, could make the Companiesfacilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect the Companies results of operations, financial performance or liquidity. Any additional federal and/or state requirements imposed on energy companies mandating limitations on GHG emissions or requiring efficiencyimprovements may result in compliance costs that alone or in combination could make some of the Companies electric generation units or natural gas facilities uneconomical to maintain or operate. The Clean Power Plan, targeted atreducing CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired power generation facilities, has been stayed and is being reviewed by the EPA. Compliance with a replacement rule for the Clean PowerPlan, or similar regulations, are expected to require increasing the energy efficiency of equipment at facilities, committing significant capital toward carbon reduction programs, purchase of allowances and/or emission rate credits, fuel switching,and/or retirement of high-emitting generation facilities and potential replacement with lower emitting generation facilities. In the absence of federal legislation, states are also contemplating regulations regarding GHG emissions. For example, theVirginia General Assembly has considered legislation which would authorize the state to directly join the RGGI program as a full participant. Given these developments and uncertainties, Dominion Energy and Virginia Power cannot estimate theaggregate effect of such requirements on their results of operations, financial condition or their customers. However, such expenditures, if material, could make Dominion Energys and Virginia Powers generation facilities uneconomical tooperate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect Dominion Energys or Virginia Powers results of operations, financial performance or liquidity. There are also potential impacts on Dominion Energys and Dominion Energy Gas natural gas businesses as federal or state GHGregulations may require GHG emission reductions from the natural gas sector which, in addition to resulting in increased costs, could affect demand for natural gas. Additionally, GHG requirements could result in increased demand for energyconservation and renewable products, which could impact the natural gas businesses.  Virginia Power is subject to risks associated withthe disposal and storage of coal ash. Virginia Power historically produced and continues to produce coal ash, or CCRs, as a by-product of its coal-fired generation operations. The ash is stored and managedin impoundments (ash ponds) and landfills located at eight different facilities.  Virginia Power is facing litigation regarding allegedCWA violations at Chesapeake power station, and may face litigation concerning its coal ash facilities at other stations. Depending on the final outcome of any such litigation, Virginia Power could incur expenses and other costs, including costsassociated withclosing, corrective action and ongoing monitoring of certain ash ponds. In addition, the EPA has issued regulations concerning the management and storage of CCRs, which Virginia has adopted.These CCR regulations require Virginia Power to make additional capital expenditures and increase its operating and maintenance expenses. Further, while Virginia Power operates its ash ponds and landfills in compliance with applicable state safety regulations, a release of coalash with a significant environmental impact, such as the Dan River ash basin release by a neighboring utility, could result in remediation costs, civil and/or criminal penalties, claims, litigation, increased regulation and compliance costs, andreputational damage, and could impact the financial condition of Virginia Power.  The Companies operations are subject tooperational hazards, equipment failures, supply chain disruptions and personnel issues which could negatively affect the Companies. Operation of the Companies facilities involves risk, including the risk of potential breakdown or failureof equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure, fuel supply, pipeline integrity or transportation disruptions, accidents, labor disputes or work stoppages by employees, acts of terrorism or sabotage, construction delays or cost overruns,shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material and labor, operational restrictions resulting from environmental limitations and governmental interventions, and performance below expected levels. The Companies businesses are dependentupon sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, the failure of which could prevent them from accomplishing critical business functions. Because the Companies transmission facilities, pipelines and other facilitiesare interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of their facilities and pipelines could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties. Operation of the Companies facilities below expected capacity levels could result in lost revenues and increased expenses, includinghigher maintenance costs. Unplanned outages of the Companies facilities and extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of the Companies business.Unplanned outages typically increase the Companies operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce their revenues as a result of selling less output or may require the Companies to incur significant costs as a result of operating higher costunits or obtaining replacement output from third parties in the open market to satisfy forward energy and capacity or other contractual obligations. Moreover, if the Companies are unable to perform their contractual obligations, penalties orliability for damages could result.  In addition, there are many risks associated with the Companies operations and thetransportation, storage and processing of natural gas and NGLs, including nuclear accidents, fires, explosions, uncontrolled release of natural gas and other environmental hazards, pole strikes, electric contact cases, the collision of third partyequipment with pipelines and avian and other wildlife impacts. Such incidents could result in loss of human life or injuries among employees, customers or the public in general, environmental pollution, damage or destruction of facilities orbusiness interruptions and associated public or   30    Table of Contents   employee safety impacts, loss of revenues, increased liabilities, heightened regulatory scrutiny and reputational risk. Further, the location of pipelines and storage facilities, or generation,transmission, substations and distribution facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power have substantial ownership interests in and operate nuclear generating units; as a result, each mayincur substantial costs and liabilities. Dominion Energys and Virginia Powers nuclear facilities are subject to operational, environmental, health and financial risks such as the on-sitestorage of spent nuclear fuel, the ability to dispose of such spent nuclear fuel, the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance available, potential operational liabilities andextended outages, the costs of replacement power, the costs of maintenance and the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks. Dominion Energy and Virginia Power maintain decommissioning trusts and external insurancecoverage to minimize the financial exposure to these risks; however, it is possible that future decommissioning costs could exceed amounts in the decommissioning trusts and/or damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. If DominionEnergys and Virginia Powers decommissioning trust funds are insufficient, and they are not allowed to recover the additional costs incurred through insurance, or in the case of Virginia Power through regulatory mechanisms, their resultsof operations could be negatively impacted.  Dominion Energys and Virginia Powers nuclear facilities are also subject tocomplex government regulation which could negatively impact their results of operations. The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generating facilities. In theevent of noncompliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines, set license conditions, shut down a nuclear unit, or take some combination of these actions, depending on its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance isachieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require Dominion Energy and Virginia Power to make substantial expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, although the Companies have no reason to anticipate a seriousnuclear incident at their plants, if an incident did occur, it could materially and adversely affect their results of operations and/or financial condition. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world, such as the nuclear events inJapan in 2011, could cause the NRC to adopt increased safety regulations or otherwise limit or restrict the operation or licensing of domestic nuclear units. Sustained declines in natural gas and NGL prices have resulted in, and could result in further, curtailments of third-party producersdrilling programs, delaying the production of volumes of natural gas and NGLs that Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas gather, process, and transport and reducing the value of NGLs retained by Dominion Energy Gas, which may adversely affectDominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas revenues and earnings. Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas obtain their supply of natural gas and NGLs from numerous third-party producers. Most producers are under no obligation to deliver aspecific quantity of natural gas orNGLs to Dominion Energys and Dominion Energy Gas facilities. A number of other factors could reduce the volumes of natural gas and NGLs available to Dominion Energys andDominion Energy Gas pipelines and other assets. Increased regulation of energy extraction activities could result in reductions in drilling for new natural gas wells, which could decrease the volumes of natural gas supplied to Dominion Energyand Dominion Energy Gas. Producers with direct commodity price exposure face liquidity constraints, which could present a credit risk to Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas. Producers could shift their production activities to regions outsideDominion Energys and Dominion Energy Gas footprint. In addition, the extent of natural gas reserves and the rate of production from such reserves may be less than anticipated. If producers were to decrease the supply of natural gas orNGLs to Dominion Energys and Dominion Energy Gas systems and facilities for any reason, Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas could experience lower revenues to the extent they are unable to replace the lost volumes on similar terms.In addition, Dominion Energy Gas revenue from processing and fractionation operations largely results from the sale of commodities at market prices. Dominion Energy Gas receives the wet gas product from producers and may retain theextracted NGLs as compensation for its services. This exposes Dominion Energy Gas to commodity price risk for the value of the spread between the NGL products and natural gas, and relative changes in these prices could adversely impact DominionEnergy Gas results.  Dominion Energys merchant power business operates in a challenging market, which could adverselyaffect its results of operations and future growth. The success of Dominion Energys merchant power business depends upon favorable market conditions including the ability to sell power at prices sufficient to cover its operatingcosts. Dominion Energy operates in active wholesale markets that expose it to price volatility for electricity and fuel as well as the credit risk of counterparties. Dominion Energy attempts to manage its price risk by entering into hedgingtransactions, including short-term and long-term fixed price sales and purchase contracts.  In these wholesale markets, the spot marketprice of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the cost of supplying the next unit of electricity to the market during that hour. In many cases, the next unit of electricity supplied would be provided by generating stations thatconsume fossil fuels, primarily natural gas. Consequently, the open market wholesale price for electricity generally reflects the cost of natural gas plus the cost to convert the fuel to electricity. Therefore, changes in the price of natural gasgenerally affect the open market wholesale price of electricity. To the extent Dominion Energy does not enter into long-term power purchase agreements or otherwise effectively hedge its output, these changes in market prices could adversely affectits financial results.  Dominion Energy purchases fuel under a variety of terms, including long-term and short-term contracts and spotmarket purchases. Dominion Energy is exposed to fuel cost volatility for the portion of its fuel obtained through short-term contracts or on the spot market, including as a result of market supply shortages. Fuel prices can be volatile and the pricethat can be obtained for power produced from such fuel may not change at the same rate as fuel costs, thus adversely impacting Dominion Energys financial results.  31Table of Contents   In addition, in the event that any of the merchant generation facilities experience a forcedoutage, Dominion Energy may not receive the level of revenue it anticipated.  The Companies financial results can be adverselyaffected by various factors driving supply and demand for electricity and gas and related services. Technological advances required by federal laws mandate new levels of energy efficiency in end-usedevices, including lighting, furnaces and electric heat pumps and could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption. Additionally, certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives toreduce energy consumption by a fixed date. Further, Virginia Powers business model is premised upon the cost efficiency of the production, transmission and distribution of large-scale centralized utility generation. However, advances indistributed generation technologies, such as solar cells, gas microturbines and fuel cells, may make these alternative generation methods competitive with large-scale utility generation, and change how customers acquire or use our services. VirginiaPower has an exclusive franchise to serve retail electric customers in Virginia. However, Virginias Retail Access Statutes allow certain Power Generation customers exceptions to this franchise. As market conditions change, VirginiaPowers customers may further pursue exceptions and Virginia Powers exclusive franchise may erode.  Reduced energy demand orsignificantly slowed growth in demand due to customer adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, distributed generation, regional economic conditions, or the impact of additional compliance obligations, unless substantially offsetthrough regulatory cost allocations, could adversely impact the value of the Companies business activities.  Dominion Energy Gas hasexperienced a decline in demand for certain of its processing services due to competing facilities operating in nearby areas.  DominionEnergy and Dominion Energy Gas may not be able to maintain, renew or replace their existing portfolio of customer contracts successfully, or on favorable terms. Upon contract expiration, customers may not elect to re-contract with Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas as a result of a variety of factors, including the amount of competition in the industry, changes in the price of natural gas, their level of satisfactionwith Dominion Energys and Dominion Energy Gas services, the extent to which Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas are able to successfully execute their business plans and the effect of the regulatory framework on customer demand. Thefailure to replace any such customer contracts on similar terms could result in a loss of revenue for Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas and related decreases in their earnings and cash flows. Certain of Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas gas pipeline services are subject to long-term, fixed-price negotiatedrate contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if the cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts. Under FERC policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree tosign a contract for service at a negotiated rate which may be above or below the FERC regulated, cost-based recourse rate for that service. These negotiated rate contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increasedcosts which could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities beingused to perform the services. Any shortfall of revenue as a result of these negotiated rate contracts could decrease Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas earnings and cashflows.  Exposure to counterparty performance may adversely affect the Companies financial results of operations. TheCompanies are exposed to credit risks of their counterparties and the risk that one or more counterparties may fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations, including but not limited to payment for services. Some of DominionEnergys operations are conducted through less than wholly-owned subsidiaries. In such arrangements, Dominion Energy is dependent on third parties to fund their required share of capital expenditures. Counterparties could fail or delay theperformance of their contractual obligations for a number of reasons, including the effect of regulations on their operations. Defaults or failure to perform by customers, suppliers, contractors, joint venture partners, financial institutions orother third parties may adversely affect the Companies financial results.  Dominion Energy will also be exposed to counterpartycredit risk relating to the terminal services agreements for the Liquefaction Project. While the counterparties obligations are supported by parental guarantees and letters of credit, there is no assurance that such credit support would besufficient to satisfy the obligations in the event of a counterparty default. In addition, if a controversy arises under either agreement resulting in a judgment in Dominion Energys favor, Dominion Energy may need to seek to enforce a finalU.S. court judgment in a foreign tribunal, which could involve a lengthy process.  Market performance and other changes may decreasethe value of Dominion Energys and Virginia Powers decommissioning trust funds and Dominion Energys and Dominion Energy Gas benefit plan assets or increase DominionEnergys and Dominion Energy Gas liabilities, which could then require significant additional funding. The performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trusts tosatisfy future obligations to decommission Dominion Energys and Virginia Powers nuclear plants and under Dominion Energys and Dominion Energy Gas pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The Companies have significantobligations in these areas and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below expected return rates. With respect to decommissioning trust funds, a decline in the market value of these assets may increase the funding requirements of theobligations to decommission Dominion Energys and Virginia Powers nuclear plants or require additional NRC-approved funding assurance. A decline in the market value of the assets held in trusts to satisfy future obligations under Dominion Energys and Dominion EnergyGas pension and other postretirement benefit plans may increase the funding requirements under such plans. Additionally, changes in interest rates will affect the liabilities under Dominion Energys and Dominion Energy Gas pensionand other postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in mortality assumptions,may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans.   32    Table of Contents   If the decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets are negatively impacted by marketfluctuations or other factors, the Companies results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows could be negatively affected. The use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses and liquidity constraints. The Companies use derivative instruments,including futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs, to manage commodity, currency and financial market risks. In addition, Dominion Energy and Dominion Energy Gas purchase and sell commodity-based contracts for hedging purposes. The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted into law in July 2010 in an effort to improve regulation of financial markets. The Dodd-Frank Act includesprovisions that will require certain over-the-counter derivatives, or swaps, to be centrally cleared and executed through an exchange or other approved trading platform.Non-financial entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end users, can choose to exempt their hedging transactions from these clearing and exchange tradingrequirements. Final rules for the over-the-counter derivative-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will continue to be established through the ongoing rulemakingprocess of the applicable regulators, including rules regarding margin requirements for non-cleared swaps. If, as a result of changes to the rulemaking process, the Companies derivative activities arenot exempted from the clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, the Companies could be subject to higher costs, including from higher margin requirements, for their derivative activities. In addition, changes to or the elimination ofrulemaking that implements Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act by the Companies counterparties could result in increased costs related to the Companies derivative activities. Changing rating agency requirements could negatively affect the Companies growth and business strategy. In order to maintainappropriate credit ratings to obtain needed credit at a reasonable cost in light of existing or future rating agency requirements, the Companies may find it necessary to take steps or change their business plans in ways that may adversely affecttheir growth and earnings. A reduction in the Companies credit ratings could result in an increase in borrowing costs, loss of access to certain markets, or both, thus adversely affecting operating results and could require the Companies topost additional collateral in connection with some of its price risk management activities.  An inability to access financial marketscould adversely affect the execution of the Companies business plans. The Companies rely on access to short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as significant sources of funding and liquidity for business plans withincreasing capital expenditure needs, normal working capital and collateral requirements related to hedges of future sales and purchases of energy-related commodities. Deterioration in the Companies creditworthiness, as evaluated by creditrating agencies or otherwise, or declines in market reputation either for the Companies or their industry in general, or general financial market disruptions outside of the Companies control could increase their cost of borrowing or restricttheir ability to access one or more financial markets. Further market disruptions could stem from delays in the current economic recovery, the bankruptcy of an unrelated company, general market disruption due to general credit market or politicalevents, orthe failure of financial institutions on which the Companies rely. Increased costs and restrictions on the Companies ability to access financial markets may be severe enough to affect theirability to execute their business plans as scheduled.  Potential changes in accounting practices may adversely affect theCompanies financial results. The Companies cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on public companies in general, the energy industry or their operations specifically. New accountingstandards could be issued that could change the way they record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. These changes in accounting standards could adversely affect earnings or could increase liabilities. War, acts and threats of terrorism, intentional acts and other significant events could adversely affect the Companies operations.The Companies cannot predict the impact that any future terrorist attacks may have on the energy industry in general, or on the Companies business in particular. Any retaliatory military strikes or sustained military campaign may affectthe Companies operations in unpredictable ways, such as changes in insurance markets and disruptions of fuel supplies and markets. In addition, the Companies infrastructure facilities, including projects under construction, could bedirect targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror. For example, a physical attack on a critical substation in California resulted in serious impacts to the power grid. Furthermore, the physical compromise of the Companiesfacilities could adversely affect the Companies ability to manage these facilities effectively. Instability in financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, intentional acts, pandemic, credit crises, recession or other factors could resultin a significant decline in the U.S. economy and increase the cost of insurance coverage. This could negatively impact the Companies results of operations and financial condition. Hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair the Companies operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information,damage the reputation of the Companies and otherwise have an adverse effect on the Companies business. The Companies own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems.Further, the computer systems that run the Companies facilities are not completely isolated from external networks. There appears to be an increasing level of activity, sophistication and maturity of threat actors, in particular nation stateactors, that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system and the U.S. gas transmission or distribution system. Such parties could view the Companies computer systems, software or networks as attractive targets for cyber attack. For example,malware has been designed to target software that runs the nations critical infrastructure such as power transmission grids and gas pipelines. In addition, the Companies businesses require that they and their vendors collect and maintainsensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss.  Asuccessful cyber attack on the systems that control the Companies electric generation, electric or gas transmission or distribution assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing the Companies from serving customers orcollecting revenues. The breach of certain business systems could affect the Companies ability to correctly record, process and reportfinan-  33Table of Contents   cial information. A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedialaction, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to the Companies reputation. In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breachnotification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring. The Companies maintain property and casualty insurance that may cover certain damage caused by potential cyber incidents; however, other damage and claims arising from suchincidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available. For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could materially and adversely affect the Companies business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to attract and retain key executive officers and an appropriately qualified workforce could have an adverse effect on theCompanies operations. The Companies business strategy is dependent on their ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees. The Companies key executive officers are the CEO, CFO and presidents and those responsible forfinancial, operational, legal, regulatory and accounting functions. Competition for skilled management employees in these areas of the Companies business operations is high. Certain events, such as an aging workforce, mismatch of skill set orcomplement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge base and the length of time required for skill development. In thiscase, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge andexpertise to new employees, or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the Companies business. In addition, certain specialized knowledge is required of the Companiestechnical employees for transmission, generation and distribution operations. The Companies inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect their business and future operating results. The completion of the merger with SCANA is subject to the receipt of consents, approvals and/or findings from governmental entities, whichmay impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on Dominion Energy or SCANA or could cause either Dominion Energy or SCANA to abandon the merger. The completion of the merger is also subject to there not having been substantive changes incertain South Carolina laws that have or would reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on SCANA or its subsidiaries or orders of governmental entities or changes in law that impose any condition that would reasonably be expected to resultin specified changes to the South Carolina Commission petition. Dominion Energy and SCANA are not required to complete the merger until after the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act expires or terminates andthe requisite authorizations, approvals, consents and/or permits are received from the FERC, NRC, South Carolina Commission, North Carolina Commission and Georgia Public Service Commission. Any of the relevant governmental entities may oppose themerger, fail to approve themerger, fail to make required findings in favor of the merger, or impose certain requirements or obligations as conditions for their consent, approval or findings or in connection with theirreview. Regulatory approvals of the merger or findings with respect to the merger may not be obtained on a timely basis or at all, and such approvals or findings may include conditions that could have an adverse effect on Dominion Energy and/orSCANA, or result in the abandonment of the merger. Dominion Energy cannot provide any assurance that Dominion Energy and SCANA will obtain the necessary approvals or findings or that any required conditions will not have an adverse effect onDominion Energy following the merger.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, the merger agreement mayrequire Dominion Energy to accept conditions from regulators that could adversely impact Dominion Energy after the merger without either of Dominion Energy or SCANA having the right to refuse to close the merger on the basis of those regulatoryconditions, except that Dominion Energy is generally not required, and SCANA is generally not permitted without Dominion Energys prior approval, to take any action or accept any condition that results in a burdensome condition for DominionEnergy or SCANA as more fully described in the SCANA Merger Agreement.  In addition, the SCANA Merger Agreement provides that DominionEnergy (but not SCANA) will have the right to refuse to complete the merger if, since the date of the SCANA Merger Agreement, any governmental entity shall have enacted any order, or there shall have been any change in law (including the Base LoadReview Act and the other laws governing South Carolina public utilities), which imposes any material change to the terms, conditions or undertakings set forth in the South Carolina Commission petition, or any significant changes to the economicvalue of the proposed terms set forth in the South Carolina Commission petition, in each case as determined by Dominion Energy in good faith. The SCANA Merger Agreement further provides that Dominion Energy will have the right to refuse to close the merger if there shall haveoccurred any substantive change in the Base Load Review Act or other laws governing South Carolina public utilities which has or would reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on SCANA or any of its subsidiaries. There is currently pendingbefore the South Carolina Senate a bill that would make substantive changes to the Base Load Review Act. This bill has passed the South Carolina House of Representatives. If this bill becomes law, Dominion Energy would not be obligated to completethe merger if it is determined that the bill has or would reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on SCANA or any of its subsidiaries. Certain lawsuits and regulatory actions have been filed against SCANA and SCE&G in connection with the abandonment of the V.C. SummerUnits 2 and 3 new nuclear development project. If the relief requested in these matters (including a request for declaratory judgment that the Base Load Review Act is unconstitutional) is granted, Dominion Energy might not be obligated to completethe merger.  Dominion Energy and SCANA can provide no assurance that these risks will not materialize and either adversely impact DominionEnergy after the completion of the merger or, if such conditions rise to the thresholds discussed above, some of which,  34    Table of Contents   as described above, are in the subjective determination of Dominion Energy acting in good faith, or if the required authorizations, approvals, consents and/or permits are not obtained orreceived, result in the abandonment of the merger.  Dominion Energy expects to incur substantial expenses related to the merger withSCANA. Dominion Energy expects to incur relatively significant expenses in connection with completing the merger. While Dominion Energy has assumed that a certain level of transaction and integration expenses would be incurred,there are a number of factors beyond its control that could affect the total amount or the timing of its integration expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. Following the merger with SCANA, Dominion Energy may be unable to successfully integrate SCANAs businesses. Dominion Energyand SCANA currently operate as independent public companies. After the merger, Dominion Energy will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating SCANAs business. Potential difficulties Dominion Energy mayencounter in the integration process include the following:  The complexities associated with integrating SCANA and its utility businesses, while at the same time continuing to provide consistent, high quality services;  The complexities of integrating a company with different core services, markets and customers;  The inability to attract and retain key employees;  Potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the merger;  Difficulties in managing political and regulatory conditions related to SCANAs utility businesses after the merger;  The cost recovery plan includes a moratorium on filing requests for adjustments in SCE&Gs base electric rates until 2021 if the merger is approved by the South Carolina Commission, which would limit DominionEnergys ability to recover increases in non-fuel related costs of electric operations for SCE&Gs customers; and  Performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of Dominion Energy managements attention caused by completing the merger and integrating SCANAs utility businesses. For these reasons, it is possible that the integration process following the merger could result in the distraction of Dominion Energysmanagement, the disruption of Dominion Energys ongoing business or inconsistencies in its services, standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect the ability of Dominion Energy to maintain or establishrelationships with current and prospective customers, vendors and employees or could otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of Dominion Energy. Dominion Energy and SCANA may be materially adversely affected by negative publicity related to the merger and in connection with otherrelated matters, including the abandonment of the V.C. Summer Units 2 and 3 new nuclear development project. From time to time, political and public sentiment in connection with the merger and in connection with other matters,including the abandonment of the V.C. Summer Units 2 and 3 new nuclear development project may result in a significantamount of adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting Dominion Energy and SCANA. Adverse press coverage and other adverse statements, whether or not driven by politicalor public sentiment, may also result in investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in legal claims. Responding to these investigations and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceedings, as well asresponding to and addressing adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements, can divert the time and effort of senior management from the management of Dominion Energys and SCANAs respective businesses. Addressing any adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny or enforcement or other legal proceedings is time consuming and expensive and,regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made, can have a negative impact on the reputation of Dominion Energy and SCANA, on the morale and performance of their employees and on their relationships with their respective regulators,customers and commercial counterparties. It may also have a negative impact on their ability to take timely advantage of various business and market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects of negative publicity, and the demands of respondingto and addressing it, may have a material adverse effect on Dominion Energys and SCANAs respective business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The market value of Dominion Energy common stock could decline if large amounts of its common stock are sold following the merger withSCANA. Following the merger, shareholders of Dominion Energy and former SCANA shareholders will own interests in a combined company operating an expanded business with more assets and a different mix of liabilities. Currentshareholders of Dominion Energy and SCANA may not wish to continue to invest in the combined company, or may wish to reduce their investment in the combined company, in order to comply with institutional investing guidelines, to increasediversification or to track any rebalancing of stock indices in which Dominion Energy common stock or SCANA common stock is or was included. If, following the merger, large amounts of Dominion Energy common stock are sold, the price of its commonstock could decline.  The merger with SCANA may not be accretive to operating earnings and may cause dilution to Dominion Energysearnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of Dominion Energy common stock. Dominion Energy currently anticipates that the merger will be immediately accretive to Dominion Energys forecasted operatingearnings per share on a standalone basis. This expectation is based on preliminary estimates, which may materially change. Dominion Energy may encounter additional transaction and integration-related costs, may fail to realize all of the benefitsanticipated in the merger or be subject to other factors that affect preliminary estimates or its ability to realize operational efficiencies. Any of these factors could cause a decrease in Dominion Energys operating earnings per share ordecrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger and contribute to a decrease in the price of Dominion Energys common stock. Dominion Energy expects the initial effect of the merger on its GAAP earnings will be a decrease in suchearnings due to the anticipated charges for refunds to SCE&G customers, write-offs of regulatory assets and transaction costs.  35Table of Contents   Litigation against SCANA and Dominion Energy could result in an injunction preventing thecompletion of the merger with SCANA or may adversely affect the combined companys business, financial condition or results of operations following the merger with SCANA. Following the announcement of the SCANA MergerAgreement, lawsuits have been filed asserting claims relating to the merger. Among other things, the lawsuits allege breaches of various fiduciary duties by the members of the SCANA board in connection with the merger and allegations that DominionEnergy and/or SCANA aided and abetted such alleged breaches. Among other remedies, the plaintiffs seek to enjoin the merger, rescind the merger agreement or be awarded monetary damages should the merger be completed. While Dominion Energy believesthat dismissal of these lawsuits is warranted, the outcome of any such litigation is inherently uncertain. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or any claim that remains unresolved at the time the merger closes may adversely affect the combinedcompanys business, financial condition or results of operation. Additionally, other lawsuits may be filed in the future making similar or new claims and seeking similar or new remedies. Dominion Energy has goodwill and other intangible assets on its balance sheet, and these amounts will increase as a result of themerger with SCANA. If its goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired in the future, Dominion Energy may be required to record a significant, non-cash charge to earnings and reduce its shareholders equity. Upon the completion ofthe merger, Dominion Energy will record as goodwill the excess of the purchase price paid by Dominion Energy over the fair value of SCANAs assets and liabilities as determined for financial accounting purposes. Under GAAP, intangible assetsare reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. If Dominion Energys intangible assets, including goodwill as a result of the merger,are determined to be impaired in the future, Dominion Energy may be required to record a significant, non-cash charge to earnings during the period in which the impairment is determined.    "
17,D,DOMINION ENERGY INC,2017-02-28,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
  TheCompanies businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyond their control. A number of these factors have been identified below. Forother factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement or projection contained in this report, see Forward-Looking Statements in Item 7. MD&A. The Companies results of operations can be affected by changes in the weather. Fluctuations in weather can affect demand for theCompanies services. For example, milder than normal weather can reduce demand for electricity and gas transmission and distribution services. In addition, severe weather, including hurricanes, winter storms, earthquakes, floods and othernatural disasters can disrupt operation of the Companies facilities and cause service outages, production delays and property damage that require incurring additional expenses. Changes in weather conditions can result in reduced water levelsor changes in water temperatures that could adversely affect operations at some of the Companies power stations. Furthermore, the Companies operations could be adversely affected and their physical plant placed at greater risk of damageshould changes in global climate produce, among other possible conditions, unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, abnormal levels of precipitation and, for operationslocated on or near coastlines, a change in sea level or sea temperatures.  The rates of Dominions and Dominion Gas gastransmission and distribution operations and Virginia Powers electric transmission, distribution and generation operations are subject to regulatory review. Revenue provided by Virginia Powers electric transmission, distribution andgeneration operations and Dominions and Dominion Gas gas transmission and  25 Table of Contents   distribution operations is based primarily on rates approved by state and federal regulatory agencies. The profitability of these businesses is dependent on their ability, through the rates thatthey are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on their capital investment.  Virginia Powerswholesale rates for electric transmission service are updated on an annual basis through operation of a FERC-approved formula rate mechanism. Through this mechanism, Virginia Powers wholesale rates for electric transmission reflect theestimated cost-of-service for each calendar year. The difference in the estimated cost-of-service and actual cost-of-service for each calendar year is included as an adjustment to the wholesale rates for electric transmission service in a subsequentcalendar year. These wholesale rates are subject to FERC review and prospective adjustment in the event that customers and/or interested state commissions file a complaint with FERC and are able to demonstrate that Virginia Powers wholesalerevenue requirement is no longer just and reasonable. They are also subject to retroactive corrections to the extent that the formula rate was not properly populated with the actual costs. Similarly, various rates and charges assessed by Dominions and Dominion Gas gas transmission businesses are subject to review byFERC. In addition, the rates of Dominions and Dominion Gas gas distribution businesses are subject to state regulatory review in the jurisdictions in which they operate. A failure by us to support these rates could result in ratedecreases from current rate levels, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  VirginiaPowers base rates, terms and conditions for generation and distribution services to customers in Virginia are reviewed by the Virginia Commission on a biennial basis in a proceeding that involves the determination of Virginia Powersactual earned ROE during a combined two-year historic test period, and the determination of Virginia Powers authorized ROE prospectively. Under certain circumstances described in the Regulation Act,Virginia Power may be required to share a portion of its earnings with customers through a refund process.  Legislation signed by theVirginia Governor in February 2015 suspends biennial reviews for the five successive 12-month test periods beginning January 1, 2015 and ending December 31, 2019, and no changes will be made toVirginia Powers existing base rates until at least December 1, 2022. During this period, Virginia Power bears the risk of any severe weather events and natural disasters, the risk of asset impairments related to the early retirement ofany generation facilities due to the implementation of the Clean Power Plan regulations, as well as an increase in general operating and financing costs, and Virginia Power may not recover its associated costs through increases to base rates. IfVirginia Power incurs any such significant additional expenses during this period, Virginia Power may not be able to recover its costs and/or earn a reasonable return on capital investment, which could negatively affect Virginia Powers futureearnings.  Virginia Powers retail electric base rates for bundled generation, transmission, and distribution services to customersin North Carolina are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject toNorth Carolina statutes, and the rules and procedures of the North Carolina Commission. If retail electric earnings exceed the returns established by the North Carolina Commission, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possiblereduction by the North Carolina Commission, whichmay decrease Virginia Powers future earnings. Additionally, if the North Carolina Commission does not allow recovery through base rates, on a timely basis, of costs incurred in providingservice, Virginia Powers future earnings could be negatively impacted.  Governmental officials, stakeholders and advocacy groups maychallenge these regulatory reviews. Such challenges may lengthen the time, complexity and costs associated with such regulatory reviews. The Companies are subject to complex governmental regulation, including tax regulation, that could adversely affect their results ofoperations and subject the Companies to monetary penalties. The Companies operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation and require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies.Such laws and regulations govern the terms and conditions of the services we offer, our relationships with affiliates, protection of our critical electric infrastructure assets and pipeline safety, among other matters. These operations are alsosubject to legislation governing taxation at the federal, state and local level. They must also comply with environmental legislation and associated regulations. Management believes that the necessary approvals have been obtained for existingoperations and that the business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws. The Companies businesses are subject to regulatory regimes which could result in substantial monetary penalties if any of the Companies is found not to be incompliance, including mandatory reliability standards and interaction in the wholesale markets. New laws or regulations, the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations, changes in enforcement practices of regulators, or penaltiesimposed for non-compliance with existing laws or regulations may result in substantial additional expense. Dominions and Virginia Powers generation business may be negatively affected by possible FERC actions that could changemarket design in the wholesale markets or affect pricing rules or revenue calculations in the RTO markets. Dominions and Virginia Powers generation stations operating in RTO markets sell capacity, energy and ancillary servicesinto wholesale electricity markets regulated by FERC. The wholesale markets allow these generation stations to take advantage of market price opportunities, but also expose them to market risk. Properly functioning competitive wholesale marketsdepend upon FERCs continuation of clearly identified market rules. From time to time FERC may investigate and authorize RTOs to make changes in market design. FERC also periodically reviews Dominions authority to sell at market-basedrates. Material changes by FERC to the design of the wholesale markets or its interpretation of market rules, Dominions or Virginia Powers authority to sell power at market-based rates, or changes to pricing rules or rules involvingrevenue calculations, could adversely impact the future results of Dominions or Virginia Powers generation business. For example, in July 2015, FERC approved changes to PJMs Reliability Pricing Model capacity market establishing anew Capacity Performance Resource product. This product offers the potential for higher capacity prices but can also impose significant economic penalties on generator owners such as Virginia Power for failure to perform during periods whenelectricity is in high demand. In addition, there have been changes to the interpretation and application of FERCs market manipulation rules. A failure to comply with these rules could lead to civil and criminal penalties.  26     Table of Contents   The Companies infrastructure build and expansion plans often require regulatoryapproval before construction can commence. The Companies may not complete facility construction, pipeline, conversion or other infrastructure projects that they commence, or they may complete projects on materially different terms or timing thaninitially anticipated, and they may not be able to achieve the intended benefits of any such project, if completed. Several facility construction, pipeline, electric transmission line, expansion, conversion and other infrastructureprojects have been announced and additional projects may be considered in the future. The Companies compete for projects with companies of varying size and financial capabilities, including some that may have competitive advantages. Commencingconstruction on announced and future projects may require approvals from applicable state and federal agencies, and such approvals could include mitigation costs which may be material to the Companies. Projects may not be able to be completed ontime as a result of weather conditions, delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory approvals, delays in obtaining key materials, labor difficulties, difficulties with partners or potential partners, a decline in the credit strength ofcounterparties or vendors, or other factors beyond the Companies control. Even if facility construction, pipeline, expansion, electric transmission line, conversion and other infrastructure projects are completed, the total costs of theprojects may be higher than anticipated and the performance of the business of the Companies following completion of the projects may not meet expectations. Start-up and operational issues can arise inconnection with the commencement of commercial operations at our facilities, including but not limited to commencement of commercial operations at our power generation facilities following expansions and fuel type conversions to natural gas andbiomass. Such issues may include failure to meet specific operating parameters, which may require adjustments to meet or amend these operating parameters. Additionally, the Companies may not be able to timely and effectively integrate theprojects into their operations and such integration may result in unforeseen operating difficulties or unanticipated costs. Further, regulators may disallow recovery of some of the costs of a project if they are deemed not to be prudently incurred.Any of these or other factors could adversely affect the Companies ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the facility construction, pipeline, electric transmission line, expansion, conversion and other infrastructure projects. The development and construction of several large-scale infrastructure projects simultaneously involves significant execution risk. TheCompanies are currently simultaneously developing or constructing several major projects, including the Liquefaction Project, the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project, the Supply Header project, Greensville County and multiple DTI projects, whichtogether help contribute to the over $24 billion in capital expenditures planned by the Companies through 2021. Several of the Companies key projects are increasingly large-scale, complex and being constructed in constrained geographicareas (for example, the Liquefaction Project) or in difficult terrain (for example, the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project). The advancement of the Companies ventures is also affected by the interventions, litigation or other activities ofstakeholder and advocacy groups, some of which oppose natural gas-related and energy infrastructure projects. For example, certain landowners andstake-holder groups oppose the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project, which could impede the acquisition of rights-of-way andother land rights on a timely basis or on acceptable terms. Given that these projects provide the foundation for the Companies strategic growth plan, if the Companies are unable to obtain or maintain the required approvals, develop thenecessary technical expertise, allocate and coordinate sufficient resources, adhere to budgets and timelines, effectively handle public outreach efforts, or otherwise fail to successfully execute the projects, there could be an adverse impact to theCompanies financial position, results of operations and cash flows. For example, while Dominion has received the required approvals to commence construction of the Liquefaction Project from the DOE, all DOE export licenses are subject toreview and possible withdrawal should the DOE conclude that such export authorization is no longer in the public interest. Failure to comply with regulatory approval conditions or an adverse ruling in any future litigation could adversely affect theCompanies ability to execute their business plan.  The Companies are dependent on their contractors for the successful and timelycompletion of large-scale infrastructure projects. The construction of such projects is expected to take several years, is typically confined within a limited geographic area or difficult terrain and could be subject to delays, cost overruns, labordisputes and other factors that could cause the total cost of the project to exceed the anticipated amount and adversely affect the Companies financial performance and/or impair the Companies ability to execute the business plan for theproject as scheduled.  Further, an inability to obtain financing or otherwise provide liquidity for the projects on acceptable terms couldnegatively affect the Companies financial condition, cash flows, the projects anticipated financial results and/or impair the Companies ability to execute the business plan for the projects as scheduled. Any additional federal and/or state requirements imposed on energy companies mandating limitations on GHG emissions or requiring efficiencyimprovements may result in compliance costs that alone or in combination could make some of the Companies electric generation units or natural gas facilities uneconomical to maintain or operate. The Clean Power Plan is targeted atreducing CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired power generation facilities. Compliance with the Clean Power Plan may require increasing the energy efficiency of equipment at facilities, committing significant capitaltoward carbon reduction programs, purchase of allowances and/or emission rate credits, fuel switching, and/or retirement of high-emitting generation facilities and potential replacement with lower emitting generation facilities. The Clean Power Planuses a set of measures for reducing emissions from existing sources that includes efficiency improvements at coal plants, displacing coal-fired generation with increased utilization of natural gas combined cycle units, and expanding renewableresources. Compliance with the Clean Power Plans anticipated implementing regulations may require Virginia Power to prematurely retire certain generating facilities, with the potential lack or delay of cost recovery and higher electric rates,which could affect consumer demand. The cost of compliance with the Clean Power Plan is subject to significant uncertainties due to the outcome of several interrelated assumptions and variables, including timing of the implementation of rules,required levels of reduc-  27 Table of Contents   tions, allocation requirements of the new rules, the maturation and commercialization of carbon controls and/or reduction programs, and the selected compliance alternatives. Dominion and VirginiaPower cannot estimate the aggregate effect of such requirements on their results of operations, financial condition or their customers. However, such expenditures, if material, could make Dominions and Virginia Powers generationfacilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect Dominions or Virginia Powers results of operations, financial performance or liquidity. There are also potential impacts on Dominions and Dominion Gas natural gas businesses as federal or state GHG regulations mayrequire GHG emission reductions from the natural gas sector which, in addition to resulting in increased costs, could affect demand for natural gas. Additionally, GHG requirements could result in increased demand for energy conservation andrenewable products, which could impact the natural gas businesses.  The Companies operations are subject to a number ofenvironmental laws and regulations which impose significant compliance costs to the Companies. The Companies operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to airquality, water quality, waste management, natural resources, and health and safety. Compliance with these legal requirements requires the Companies to commit significant capital toward permitting, emission fees, environmental monitoring,installation and operation of environmental control equipment and purchase of allowances and/or offsets. Additionally, the Companies could be responsible for expenses relating to remediation and containment obligations, including at sites where theyhave been identified by a regulatory agency as a potentially responsible party. Expenditures relating to environmental compliance have been significant in the past, and the Companies expect that they will remain significant in the future. Certainfacilities have become uneconomical to operate and have been shut down, converted to new fuel types or sold. These types of events could occur again in the future. We expect that existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and/or new laws may be adopted or become applicable, includingregulation of GHG emissions which could have an impact on the Companies business. Risks relating to expected regulation of GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units are discussed above. In addition, furtherregulation of air quality and GHG emissions under the CAA will be imposed on the natural gas sector, including rules to limit methane leakage. The Companies are also subject to recently finalized federal water and waste regulations, includingregulations concerning cooling water intake structures, coal combustion by-product handling and disposal practices, wastewater discharges from steam electric generating stations, management and disposal ofhydraulic fracturing fluids and the potential further regulation of polychlorinated biphenyls.  Compliance costs cannot be estimated withcertainty due to the inability to predict the requirements and timing of implementation of any new environmental rules or regulations. Other factors which affect the ability to predict future environmental expenditures with certainty include thedifficulty in estimating clean-up costs and quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all responsible parties. However, such expenditures, if material, couldmake the Companies facilities uneconomical to operate, result inthe impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect the Companies results of operations, financial performance or liquidity. Virginia Power is subject to risks associated with the disposal and storage of coal ash. Virginia Power historically produced andcontinues to produce coal ash, or CCRs, as a by-product of its coal-fired generation operations. The ash is stored and managed in impoundments (ash ponds) and landfills located at eight different facilities. Virginia Power may face litigation regarding alleged CWA violations at Possum Point power station, and is facing litigation regardingalleged CWA violations at Chesapeake power station and could incur settlement expenses and other costs, depending on the outcome of any such litigation, including costs associated with closing, corrective action and ongoing monitoring of certain ashponds. In addition, the EPA and Virginia recently issued regulations concerning the management and storage of CCRs and West Virginia may impose additional regulations that would apply to the facilities noted above. These regulations would requireVirginia Power to make additional capital expenditures and increase its operating and maintenance expenses.  Further, while Virginia Poweroperates its ash ponds and landfills in compliance with applicable state safety regulations, a release of coal ash with a significant environmental impact, such as the Dan River ash basin release by a neighboring utility, could result in remediationcosts, civil and/or criminal penalties, claims, litigation, increased regulation and compliance costs, and reputational damage, and could impact the financial condition of Virginia Power. The Companies operations are subject to operational hazards, equipment failures, supply chain disruptions and personnel issues whichcould negatively affect the Companies. Operation of the Companies facilities involves risk, including the risk of potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure, fuel supply, pipeline integrity ortransportation disruptions, accidents, labor disputes or work stoppages by employees, acts of terrorism or sabotage, construction delays or cost overruns, shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material and labor, operational restrictionsresulting from environmental limitations and governmental interventions, and performance below expected levels. The Companies businesses are dependent upon sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, the failure ofwhich could prevent them from accomplishing critical business functions. Because the Companies transmission facilities, pipelines and other facilities are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of their facilities andpipelines could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties.  Operation ofthe Companies facilities below expected capacity levels could result in lost revenues and increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs. Unplanned outages of the Companies facilities and extensions of scheduled outages due tomechanical failures or other problems occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of the Companies business. Unplanned outages typically increase the Companies operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce their revenues as aresult of selling less output or may require the Companies to incur significant costs as a result of operating higher cost units or obtaining replacement output from third parties in the open  28     Table of Contents   market to satisfy forward energy and capacity or other contractual obligations. Moreover, if the Companies are unable to perform their contractual obligations, penalties or liability fordamages could result.  In addition, there are many risks associated with the Companies operations and the transportation, storageand processing of natural gas and NGLs, including nuclear accidents, fires, explosions, uncontrolled release of natural gas and other environmental hazards, pole strikes, electric contact cases, the collision of third party equipment with pipelinesand avian and other wildlife impacts. Such incidents could result in loss of human life or injuries among employees, customers or the public in general, environmental pollution, damage or destruction of facilities or business interruptions andassociated public or employee safety impacts, loss of revenues, increased liabilities, heightened regulatory scrutiny and reputational risk. Further, the location of pipelines and storage facilities, or generation, transmission, substations anddistribution facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. Dominion and Virginia Power have substantial ownership interests in and operate nuclear generating units; as a result, each may incursubstantial costs and liabilities. Dominions and Virginia Powers nuclear facilities are subject to operational, environmental, health and financial risks such as the on-site storage of spentnuclear fuel, the ability to dispose of such spent nuclear fuel, the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance available, potential operational liabilities and extended outages, thecosts of replacement power, the costs of maintenance and the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks. Dominion and Virginia Power maintain decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage to minimize the financialexposure to these risks; however, it is possible that future decommissioning costs could exceed amounts in the decommissioning trusts and/or damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. If Dominions and Virginia Powersdecommissioning trust funds are insufficient, and they are not allowed to recover the additional costs incurred through insurance, or in the case of Virginia Power through regulatory mechanisms, their results of operations could be negativelyimpacted.  Dominions and Virginia Powers nuclear facilities are also subject to complex government regulation which couldnegatively impact their results of operations. The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generating facilities. In the event of noncompliance, the NRC has theauthority to impose fines, set license conditions, shut down a nuclear unit, or take some combination of these actions, depending on its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirementspromulgated by the NRC could require Dominion and Virginia Power to make substantial expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, although the Companies have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at their plants, if an incidentdid occur, it could materially and adversely affect their results of operations and/or financial condition. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world, such as the nuclear events in Japan in 2011, could causethe NRC to adopt increased safety regulations or otherwise limit or restrict the operation or licensing of domestic nuclear units. Sustained declines in natural gas and NGL prices have resulted in, and could result in further, curtailments of third-party producersdrilling programs, delaying the production of volumes of natural gas and NGLs that Dominion and Dominion Gas gather, process, and transport and reducing the value of NGLs retained by Dominion Gas, which may adversely affect Dominion andDominion Gas revenues and earnings. Dominion and Dominion Gas obtain their supply of natural gas and NGLs from numerous third-party producers. Most producers are under no obligation to deliver a specific quantity of natural gas or NGLs toDominions and Dominion Gas facilities. A number of other factors could reduce the volumes of natural gas and NGLs available to Dominions and Dominion Gas pipelines and other assets. Increased regulation of energy extractionactivities could result in reductions in drilling for new natural gas wells, which could decrease the volumes of natural gas supplied to Dominion and Dominion Gas. Producers with direct commodity price exposure face liquidity constraints, whichcould present a credit risk to Dominion and Dominion Gas. Producers could shift their production activities to regions outside Dominions and Dominion Gas footprint. In addition, the extent of natural gas reserves and the rate ofproduction from such reserves may be less than anticipated. If producers were to decrease the supply of natural gas or NGLs to Dominions and Dominion Gas systems and facilities for any reason, Dominion and Dominion Gas could experiencelower revenues to the extent they are unable to replace the lost volumes on similar terms. In addition, Dominion Gas revenue from processing and fractionation operations largely results from the sale of commodities at marketprices. Dominion Gas receives the wet gas product from producers and may retain the extracted NGLs as compensation for its services. This exposes Dominion Gas to commodity price risk for the value of the spread between the NGL products andnatural gas, and relative changes in these prices could adversely impact Dominion Gas results.  Dominions merchant powerbusiness operates in a challenging market, which could adversely affect its results of operations and future growth. The success of Dominions merchant power business depends upon favorable market conditions including the ability tosell power at prices sufficient to cover its operating costs. Dominion operates in active wholesale markets that expose it to price volatility for electricity and fuel as well as the credit risk of counterparties. Dominion attempts to manage itsprice risk by entering into hedging transactions, including short-term and long-term fixed price sales and purchase contracts.  In thesewholesale markets, the spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the cost of supplying the next unit of electricity to the market during that hour. In many cases, the next unit of electricity supplied would beprovided by generating stations that consume fossil fuels, primarily natural gas. Consequently, the open market wholesale price for electricity generally reflects the cost of natural gas plus the cost to convert the fuel to electricity. Therefore,changes in the price of natural gas generally affect the open market wholesale price of electricity. To the extent Dominion does not enter into long-term power purchase agreements or otherwise effectively hedge its output, these changes in marketprices could adversely affect its financial results.   29 Table of Contents   Dominion purchases fuel under a variety of terms, including long-term and short-term contractsand spot market purchases. Dominion is exposed to fuel cost volatility for the portion of its fuel obtained through short-term contracts or on the spot market, including as a result of market supply shortages. Fuel prices can be volatile and theprice that can be obtained for power produced from such fuel may not change at the same rate as fuel costs, thus adversely impacting Dominions financial results. In addition, in the event that any of the merchant generation facilities experience a forced outage, Dominion may not receive the level ofrevenue it anticipated.  The Companies financial results can be adversely affected by various factors driving demand forelectricity and gas and related services. Technological advances required by federal laws mandate new levels of energy efficiency in end-use devices, including lighting, furnaces and electric heatpumps and could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption. Additionally, certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by a fixed date. Further,Virginia Powers business model is premised upon the cost efficiency of the production, transmission and distribution of large-scale centralized utility generation. However, advances in distributed generation technologies, such as solar cells,gas microturbines and fuel cells, may make these alternative generation methods competitive with large-scale utility generation, and change how customers acquire or use our services. Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due to customer adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation,distributed generation, regional economic conditions, or the impact of additional compliance obligations, unless substantially offset through regulatory cost allocations, could adversely impact the value of the Companies business activities. Dominion Gas has experienced a decline in demand for certain of its processing services due to competing facilities operating in nearbyareas.  Dominion and Dominion Gas may not be able to maintain, renew or replace their existing portfolio of customer contractssuccessfully, or on favorable terms. Upon contract expiration, customers may not elect to re-contract with Dominion and Dominion Gas as a result of a variety of factors, including the amount ofcompetition in the industry, changes in the price of natural gas, their level of satisfaction with Dominions and Dominion Gas services, the extent to which Dominion and Dominion Gas are able to successfully execute their business plansand the effect of the regulatory framework on customer demand. The failure to replace any such customer contracts on similar terms could result in a loss of revenue for Dominion and Dominion Gas and related decreases in their earnings and cashflows.  Certain of Dominion and Dominion Gas gas pipeline services are subject to long-term, fixed-price negotiatedrate contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if the cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts. Under FERC policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree tosign a contract for service at a negotiated rate which may be above or below the FERC regulated, cost-based recourse rate for that service. These negotiated rate contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increasedcosts which could be produced by inflation or otherfactors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services. Any shortfall of revenue as result of these negotiated rate contracts could decrease Dominion andDominion Gas earnings and cash flows.  Exposure to counterparty performance may adversely affect the Companies financialresults of operations. The Companies are exposed to credit risks of their counterparties and the risk that one or more counterparties may fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations, including but not limited to payment forservices. Some of Dominions operations are conducted through less than wholly-owned subsidiaries. In such arrangements, Dominion is dependent on third parties to fund their required share of capital expenditures. Counterparties could fail ordelay the performance of their contractual obligations for a number of reasons, including the effect of regulations on their operations. Defaults or failure to perform by customers, suppliers, joint venture partners, financial institutions or otherthird parties may adversely affect the Companies financial results.  Dominion will also be exposed to counterparty credit riskrelating to the terminal services agreements for the Liquefaction Project. While the counterparties obligations are supported by parental guarantees and letters of credit, there is no assurance that such credit support would be sufficient tosatisfy the obligations in the event of a counterparty default. In addition, if a controversy arises under either agreement resulting in a judgment in Dominions favor, Dominion may need to seek to enforce a final U.S. court judgment in aforeign tribunal, which could involve a lengthy process.  Market performance and other changes may decrease the value ofDominions decommissioning trust funds and Dominions and Dominion Gas benefit plan assets or increase Dominions and Dominion Gas liabilities, which could then require significant additional funding. Theperformance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trusts to satisfy future obligations to decommission Dominions nuclear plants and under Dominions and Dominion Gas pension and other postretirementbenefit plans. Dominion and Dominion Gas have significant obligations in these areas and holds significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below expected returnrates.  With respect to decommissioning trust funds, a decline in the market value of these assets may increase the funding requirementsof the obligations to decommission Dominions nuclear plants or require additional NRC-approved funding assurance. A decline in the market value of the assets held in trusts to satisfy future obligations under Dominions and Dominion Gas pensionand other postretirement benefit plans may increase the funding requirements under such plans. Additionally, changes in interest rates will affect the liabilities under Dominions and Dominion Gas pension and other postretirement benefitplans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in mortality assumptions, may also increase the fundingrequirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  If the decommissioning trust funds andbenefit plan assets are negatively impacted by market fluctuations or other factors,  30     Table of Contents   Dominions and Dominion Gas results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows could be negatively affected. The use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses and liquidity constraints. The Companies use derivative instruments,including futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs, to manage commodity, currency and financial market risks. In addition, Dominion and Dominion Gas purchase and sell commodity-based contracts for hedging purposes. The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted into law in July 2010 in an effort to improve regulation of financial markets. The Dodd-Frank Act includesprovisions that will require certain over-the-counter derivatives, or swaps, to be centrally cleared and executed through an exchange or other approved trading platform.Non-financial entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end users, can choose to exempt their hedging transactions from these clearing and exchange tradingrequirements. Final rules for the over-the-counter derivative-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will continue to be established through the ongoing rulemakingprocess of the applicable regulators, including rules regarding margin requirements for non-cleared swaps. If, as a result of the rulemaking process, the Companies derivative activities are not exemptedfrom the clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, the Companies could be subject to higher costs, including from higher margin requirements, for their derivative activities. In addition, the implementation of, and compliance with, TitleVII of the Dodd-Frank Act by the Companies counterparties could result in increased costs related to the Companies derivative activities. Changing rating agency requirements could negatively affect the Companies growth and business strategy. In order to maintainappropriate credit ratings to obtain needed credit at a reasonable cost in light of existing or future rating agency requirements, the Companies may find it necessary to take steps or change their business plans in ways that may adversely affecttheir growth and earnings. A reduction in the Companies credit ratings could result in an increase in borrowing costs, loss of access to certain markets, or both, thus adversely affecting operating results and could require the Companies topost additional collateral in connection with some of its price risk management activities.  An inability to access financial marketscould adversely affect the execution of the Companies business plans. The Companies rely on access to short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as significant sources of funding and liquidity for business plans withincreasing capital expenditure needs, normal working capital and collateral requirements related to hedges of future sales and purchases of energy-related commodities. Deterioration in the Companies creditworthiness, as evaluated by creditrating agencies or otherwise, or declines in market reputation either for the Companies or their industry in general, or general financial market disruptions outside of the Companies control could increase their cost of borrowing or restricttheir ability to access one or more financial markets. Further market disruptions could stem from delays in the current economic recovery, the bankruptcy of an unrelated company, general market disruption due to general credit market or politicalevents, or the failure of financial institutions on which the Companies rely. Increased costs and restrictions on the Companies ability toaccess financial markets may be severe enough to affect their ability to execute their business plans as scheduled. Potential changes in accounting practices may adversely affect the Companies financial results. The Companies cannot predict theimpact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on public companies in general, the energy industry or their operations specifically. New accounting standards could be issued that could change the way they record revenues,expenses, assets and liabilities. These changes in accounting standards could adversely affect earnings or could increase liabilities. War, acts and threats of terrorism, intentional acts and other significant events could adversely affect the Companies operations.The Companies cannot predict the impact that any future terrorist attacks may have on the energy industry in general, or on the Companies business in particular. Any retaliatory military strikes or sustained military campaign may affectthe Companies operations in unpredictable ways, such as changes in insurance markets and disruptions of fuel supplies and markets. In addition, the Companies infrastructure facilities, including projects under construction, could bedirect targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror. For example, a physical attack on a critical substation in California resulted in serious impacts to the power grid. Furthermore, the physical compromise of the Companiesfacilities could adversely affect the Companies ability to manage these facilities effectively. Instability in financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, intentional acts, pandemic, credit crises, recession or other factors could resultin a significant decline in the U.S. economy and increase the cost of insurance coverage. This could negatively impact the Companies results of operations and financial condition. Hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair the Companies operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information,damage the reputation of the Companies and otherwise have an adverse effect on the Companies business. The Companies own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems.Further, the computer systems that run the Companies facilities are not completely isolated from external networks. There appears to be an increasing level of activity, sophistication and maturity of threat actors, in particular nation stateactors, that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system and the U.S. gas transmission or distribution system. Such parties could view the Companies computer systems, software or networks as attractive targets for cyber attack. For example,malware has been designed to target software that runs the nations critical infrastructure such as power transmission grids and gas pipelines. In addition, the Companies businesses require that they and their vendors collect and maintainsensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss.  Asuccessful cyber attack on the systems that control the Companies electric generation, electric or gas transmission or distribution assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing the Companies from serving customers orcollecting revenues. The breach of certain business systems could affect the Companies ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repairsecurity breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to the Companies reputation. In addition, the misappropriation,  31 Table of Contents   corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring. TheCompanies maintain property and casualty insurance that may cover certain damage caused by potential cyber incidents; however, other damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insuranceavailable. For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could materially and adversely affect the Companies business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to attract and retain key executive officers and an appropriately qualified workforce could have an adverse effect on theCompanies operations. The Companies business strategy is dependent on their ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees. The Companies key executive officers are the CEO, CFO and presidents and those responsible forfinancial, operational, legal, regulatory and accounting functions. Competition for skilled management employees in these areas of the Companies business operations is high. Certain events, such as an aging workforce, mismatch of skill set orcomplement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge base and the length of time required for skill development. In thiscase, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge andexpertise to new employees, or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the Companies business. In addition, certain specialized knowledge is required of the Companiestechnical employees for transmission, generation and distribution operations. The Companies inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect their business and future operating results. The Questar Combination may not achieve its intended results. The Questar Combination is expected to result in various benefits,including, among other things, being accretive to earnings. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the transaction is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the business of Dominion Questar is integrated in an efficient and effectivemanner. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues generated by the combined company and diversion of managements time and energy, all of which could have anadverse effect on the combined companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.    "
13,D,DOMINION ENERGY INC,2016-02-26,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
  The Companies businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyond their control. A number ofthese factors have been identified below. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement or projection contained in this report, see Forward-Looking Statements inItem 7. MD&A.  The Companies results of operations can be affected by changes in the weather.Fluctuations in weather can affect demand for the Companies services. For example, milder than normal weather can reduce demand for electricity and gas transmission and distribution services. In addition, severe weather, includinghurricanes, winter storms, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters can disrupt operation of the Companies facilities and cause service outages, production delays and property damage that require incurring additional expenses. Changesin weather conditions can result in reduced water levels or changes in water temperatures that could adversely affect operations at some of the Companies power stations. Furthermore, the Companies operations could be adversely affectedand their physical plant placed at greater risk of damage should changes in global climate produce, among other possible conditions, unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weatherevents, abnormal levels of precipitation and, for operations located on or near coastlines, a change in sea level or sea temperatures.  The rates of Dominions and Dominion Gas gas transmission and distribution operations and Virginia Powers electric transmission, distribution and generation operations are subject toregulatory review. Revenue provided by Virginia Powers electric transmission, distribution and generation operations and Dominions and Dominion Gas gas transmission and distribution operations is based primarily on ratesapproved by state and federal regulatory agencies. The profitability of these businesses is dependent on their ability, through the rates that they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on their capitalinvestment.  Virginia Powers wholesale rates for electric transmission service are updated on an annual basis throughoperation of a FERC-approved formula rate mechanism. Through this mechanism, Virginia Powers wholesale rates for electric transmission reflect the estimated cost of service for each calendar year. The difference in the estimated cost ofservice and actual cost of service for each calendar year is included as an adjustment to the wholesale rates for electric transmission service in a subsequent calendar year. These wholesale rates are subject to FERC review and prospectiveadjustment in the event that customers and/or interested state commissions file a complaint with FERC and are able to demonstrate that Virginia Powers wholesale revenue requirement is no longer just and reasonable. They are also subject toretroactive corrections to the extent that the formula rate was not properly populated with the actual costs.  Similarly,various rates and charges assessed by Dominions and Dominion Gas gas transmission businesses are subject to review by FERC. Pursuant to FERCs February 2014 approval of DTIs uncontested settlement offer, DTIs base ratesfor storage and transportation services are subject to a moratorium through  25 Table of Contents   the end of 2016. In addition, the rates of Dominions and Dominion Gas gas distribution businesses are subject to state regulatory review in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Afailure by us to support these rates could result in rate decreases from current rate levels, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Virginia Powers base rates, terms and conditions for generation and distribution services to customers in Virginia are reviewed bythe Virginia Commission on a biennial basis in a proceeding that involves the determination of Virginia Powers actual earned ROE during a combined two-year historic test period, and the determination of Virginia Powers authorized ROEprospectively. Under certain circumstances described in the Regulation Act, Virginia Power may be required to share a portion of its earnings with customers through a refund process. Legislation signed by the Virginia Governor in February 2015 suspends biennial reviews for the five successive 12-month test periodsbeginning January 1, 2015 and ending December 31, 2019, and no changes will be made to Virginia Powers existing base rates until at least December 1, 2022. During this period, Virginia Power bears the risk of any severe weatherevents and natural disasters, the risk of asset impairments related to the early retirement of any generation facilities due to the implementation of the Clean Power Plan regulations, as well as an increase in general operating and financing costs,and Virginia Power may not recover its associated costs through increases to base rates. If Virginia Power incurs any such significant additional expenses during this period, Virginia Power may not be able to recover its costs and/or earn areasonable return on capital investment, which could negatively affect Virginia Powers future earnings.  VirginiaPowers retail electric base rates for bundled generation, transmission, and distribution services to customers in North Carolina are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to North Carolina statutes, and the rules andprocedures of the North Carolina Commission. If retail electric earnings exceed the returns established by the North Carolina Commission, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the North Carolina Commission, whichmay decrease Virginia Powers future earnings. Additionally, if the North Carolina Commission does not allow recovery through base rates, on a timely basis, of costs incurred in providing service, Virginia Powers future earnings could benegatively impacted.  Governmental officials, stakeholders and advocacy groups may challenge these regulatory reviews. Suchchallenges may lengthen the time, complexity and costs associated with such regulatory reviews.  The Companies are subjectto complex governmental regulation, including tax regulation, that could adversely affect their results of operations and subject the Companies to monetary penalties. The Companies operations are subject to extensive federal, state andlocal regulation and require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies. Such laws and regulations govern the terms and conditions of the services we offer, our relationships with affiliates, protection ofour critical electric infrastructure assets and pipeline safety, among other matters. These operations are also subject to legislation governing taxation at the federal, state and local level. They must also comply with environmental legislation andassociated regulations. Management believes that the necessary approvals havebeen obtained for existing operations and that the business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws. The Companies businesses are subject to regulatory regimes which couldresult in substantial monetary penalties if any of the Companies is found not to be in compliance, including mandatory reliability standards and interaction in the wholesale markets. New laws or regulations, the revision or reinterpretation ofexisting laws or regulations, changes in enforcement practices of regulators, or penalties imposed for non-compliance with existing laws or regulations may result in substantial additional expense. Dominions and Virginia Powers generation business may be negatively affected by possible FERC actions that could changemarket design in the wholesale markets or affect pricing rules or revenue calculations in the RTO markets. Dominions and Virginia Powers generation stations operating in RTO markets sell capacity, energy and ancillary services intowholesale electricity markets regulated by FERC. The wholesale markets allow these generation stations to take advantage of market price opportunities, but also expose them to market risk. Properly functioning competitive wholesale markets dependupon FERCs continuation of clearly identified market rules. From time to time FERC may investigate and authorize RTOs to make changes in market design. FERC also periodically reviews Dominions authority to sell at market-basedrates. Material changes by FERC to the design of the wholesale markets or its interpretation of market rules, Dominions or Virginia Powers authority to sell power at market-based rates, or changes to pricing rules or rules involvingrevenue calculations, could adversely impact the future results of Dominions or Virginia Powers generation business. For example, in July 2015, FERC approved changes to PJMs Reliability Pricing Model capacity market establishing anew Capacity Performance Resource product. This product offers the potential for higher capacity prices but can also impose significant economic penalties on generator owners such as Virginia Power for failure to perform during periods whenelectricity is in high demand. In addition, there have been changes to the interpretation and application of FERCs market manipulation rules. A failure to comply with these rules could lead to civil and criminal penalties. The Companies infrastructure build and expansion plans often require regulatory approval before construction cancommence. The Companies may not complete facility construction, pipeline, conversion or other infrastructure projects that they commence, or they may complete projects on materially different terms or timing than initially anticipated, and they maynot be able to achieve the intended benefits of any such project, if completed. Several facility construction, pipeline, electric transmission line, expansion, conversion and other infrastructure projects have been announced and additionalprojects may be considered in the future. The Companies compete for projects with companies of varying size and financial capabilities, including some that may have competitive advantages. Commencing construction on announced and future projects mayrequire approvals from applicable state and federal agencies, and such approvals could include mitigation costs which may be material to the Companies. Projects may not be able to be completed on time as a result of weather conditions, delays inobtaining or failure to obtain regulatory approvals, delays in obtaining key materials, labor difficulties, difficulties with partners or  26     Table of Contents   potential partners, a decline in the credit strength of counterparties or vendors, or other factors beyond the Companies control. Even if facility construction, pipeline, expansion,electric transmission line, conversion and other infrastructure projects are completed, the total costs of the projects may be higher than anticipated and the performance of the business of the Companies following completion of the projects may notmeet expectations. Start-up and operational issues can arise in connection with the commencement of commercial operations at our facilities, including but not limited to commencement of commercial operations at our power generation facilitiesfollowing expansions and fuel type conversions to natural gas and biomass. Such issues may include failure to meet specific operating parameters, which may require adjustments to meet or amend these operating parameters. Additionally, theCompanies may not be able to timely and effectively integrate the projects into their operations and such integration may result in unforeseen operating difficulties or unanticipated costs. Further, regulators may disallow recovery of some ofthe costs of a project if they are deemed not to be prudently incurred. Any of these or other factors could adversely affect the Companies ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the facility construction, pipeline, electrictransmission line, expansion, conversion and other infrastructure projects.  The development and construction ofseveral large-scale infrastructure projects simultaneously involves significant execution risk. The Companies are currently simultaneously developing or constructing several major projects, including the Liquefaction Project, the Atlantic CoastPipeline Project, the Supply Header project, Greensville County, Brunswick County, and multiple DTI producer outlet projects, which together help contribute to the over $23 billion in capital expenditures planned by the Companies through 2020.Several of the Companies key projects are increasingly large-scale, complex and being constructed in constrained geographic areas (for example, the Liquefaction Project) or in difficult terrain (for example, the Atlantic Coast PipelineProject). The advancement of the Companies ventures is also affected by the interventions, litigation or other activities of stakeholder and advocacy groups, some of which oppose natural gas-related and energy infrastructure projects. Forexample, certain landowners and stakeholder groups oppose the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, which could impede the acquisition of rights-of-way and other land rights on a timely basis or on acceptable terms. Given that these projects provide thefoundation for the Companies strategic growth plan, if the Companies are unable to obtain or maintain the required approvals, develop the necessary technical expertise, allocate and coordinate sufficient resources, adhere to budgets andtimelines, effectively handle public outreach efforts, or otherwise fail to successfully execute the projects, there could be an adverse impact to the Companies financial position, results of operations and cash flows. For example, whileDominion has received the required approvals to commence construction of the Liquefaction Project from the DOE, all DOE export licenses are subject to review and possible withdrawal should the DOE conclude that such export authorization is no longerin the public interest. Failure to comply with regulatory approval conditions or an adverse ruling in any future litigation could adversely affect the Companies ability to execute its business plan.The Companies are dependent on their contractors for the successful and timely completionof large-scale infrastructure projects. The construction of such projects is expected to take several years, is typically confined within a limited geographic area or difficult terrain and could be subject to delays, cost overruns, labor disputesand other factors that could cause the total cost of the project to exceed the anticipated amount and adversely affect the Companies financial performance and/or impair the Companies ability to execute the business plan for the projectas scheduled.  Further, an inability to obtain financing or otherwise provide liquidity for the projects on acceptable termscould negatively affect the Companies financial condition, cash flows, the projects anticipated financial results and/or impair the Companies ability to execute the business plan for the projects as scheduled. Any additional federal and/or state requirements imposed on energy companies mandating limitations on GHGemissions or requiring efficiency improvements may result in compliance costs that alone or in combination could make some of the Companies electric generation units or natural gas facilities uneconomical to maintain or operate. The CleanPower Plan is targeted at reducing CO2 emissions fromexisting fossil fuel-fired power generation facilities.  Compliance with the Clean Power Plan may require increasing theenergy efficiency of equipment at facilities, committing significant capital toward carbon reduction programs, purchase of allowances and/or emission rate credits, fuel switching, and/or retirement of high-emitting generation facilities andpotential replacement with lower emitting generation facilities. The Clean Power Plan uses a set of measures for reducing emissions from existing sources that includes efficiency improvements at coal plants, displacing coal-fired generation withincreased utilization of natural gas combined cycle units, and expanding renewable resources. Compliance with the Clean Power Plans anticipated implementing regulations may require Virginia Power to prematurely retire certain generatingfacilities, with the potential lack or delay of cost recovery and higher electric rates, which could affect consumer demand. The cost of compliance with the Clean Power Plan is subject to significant uncertainties due to the outcome of severalinterrelated assumptions and variables, including timing of the implementation of rules, required levels of reductions, allocation requirements of the new rules, the maturation and commercialization of carbon controls and/or reduction programs, andthe selected compliance alternatives. Dominion and Virginia Power cannot estimate the aggregate effect of such requirements on their results of operations, financial condition or their customers. However, such expenditures, if material, could makeDominions and Virginia Powers generation facilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect Dominions or Virginia Powers results of operations, financial performance orliquidity.  There are also potential impacts on Dominions and Dominion Gas natural gas businesses as federal orstate GHG regulations may require GHG emission reductions from the natural gas sector and could affect demand for natural gas. Additionally, GHG requirements could result in increased demand for energy conservation and renewable products, whichcould impact the natural gas businesses.   27 Table of Contents   The Companies operations are subject to a number of environmental laws andregulations which impose significant compliance costs to the Companies. The Companies operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, wastemanagement, natural resources, and health and safety. Compliance with these legal requirements requires the Companies to commit significant capital toward permitting, emission fees, environmental monitoring, installation and operation ofenvironmental control equipment and purchase of allowances and/or offsets. Additionally, the Companies could be responsible for expenses relating to remediation and containment obligations, including at sites where they have beenidentified by a regulatory agency as a potentially responsible party. Expenditures relating to environmental compliance have been significant in the past, and the Companies expect that they will remain significant in the future.Certain facilities have become uneconomical to operate and have been shut down, converted to new fuel types or sold. These types of events could occur again in the future. Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and/or new laws may be adopted or become applicable to the Companies. Risksrelating to expected regulation of GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units are discussed above. In addition, further regulation of air quality and GHG emissions under the CAA will be imposed on the natural gas sector,including rules to limit methane leakage. The Companies are also subject to recently finalized federal water and waste regulations, including regulations concerning cooling water intake structures, coal combustion by-product handling and disposalpractices, wastewater discharges from steam electric generating stations and the potential further regulation of polychlorinated biphenyls.  Compliance costs cannot be estimated with certainty due to the inability to predict the requirements and timing of implementation of any new environmental rules or regulations. Other factors which affectthe ability to predict future environmental expenditures with certainty include the difficulty in estimating clean-up costs and quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all responsible parties.However, such expenditures, if material, could make the Companies facilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect the Companies results of operations, financial performance orliquidity.  Virginia Power is subject to risks associated with the disposal and storage of coal ash. Virginia Powerhistorically produced and continues to produce coal ash, or CCRs, as a by-product of its coal-fired generation operations. The ash is stored and managed in impoundments (ash ponds) and landfills located at eight different facilities. Virginia Power may face litigation regarding alleged CWA violations at Possum Point, and is facing litigation regardingalleged CWA violations at Chesapeake and could incur settlement expenses and other costs, depending on the outcome of any such litigation, including costs associated with closing, corrective action and ongoing monitoring of certain ash ponds. Inaddition, the EPA and Virginia recently issued regulations concerning the management and storage of CCRs and West Virginia may impose additional regulations that will apply to the facilities noted above. These regulations will require Virginia Powerto make additionalcapital expenditures and increase its operating and maintenance expenses. Further, while Virginia Power operates its ash ponds and landfills in compliance with applicable state safety regulations, a release ofcoal ash with a significant environmental impact, such as the Dan River ash basin release by a neighboring utility, could result in remediation costs, civil and/or criminal penalties, claims, litigation, increased regulation and compliance costs,and reputational damage, and could impact the financial condition of Virginia Power.  The Companies operations aresubject to operational hazards, equipment failures, supply chain disruptions and personnel issues which could negatively affect the Companies. Operation of the Companies facilities involves risk, including the risk of potential breakdownor failure of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure, fuel supply, pipeline integrity or transportation disruptions, accidents, labor disputes or work stoppages by employees, acts of terrorism or sabotage, construction delays or costoverruns, shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material and labor, operational restrictions resulting from environmental limitations and governmental interventions, and performance below expected levels. The Companies businesses aredependent upon sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, the failure of which could prevent them from accomplishing critical business functions. Because the Companies transmission facilities, pipelines and otherfacilities are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of their facilities and pipelines could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties. Operation of the Companies facilities below expected capacity levels could result in lost revenues and increased expenses, includinghigher maintenance costs. Unplanned outages of the Companies facilities and extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of the Companies business.Unplanned outages typically increase the Companies operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce their revenues as a result of selling less output or may require the Companies to incur significant costs as a result of operating higher costunits or obtaining replacement output from third parties in the open market to satisfy forward energy and capacity or other contractual obligations. Moreover, if the Companies are unable to perform their contractual obligations, penalties orliability for damages could result.  In addition, there are many risks associated with the Companies operations and thetransportation, storage and processing of natural gas and NGLs, including nuclear accidents, fires, explosions, uncontrolled release of natural gas and other environmental hazards, pole strikes, electric contact cases, the collision of third partyequipment with pipelines and avian and other wildlife impacts. Such incidents could result in loss of human life or injuries among employees, customers or the public in general, environmental pollution, damage or destruction of facilities orbusiness interruptions and associated public or employee safety impacts, loss of revenues, increased liabilities, heightened regulatory scrutiny and reputational risk. Further, the location of pipelines and storage facilities, or generation,transmission, substations and distribution facilities near populated   28     Table of Contents   areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. Dominion and Virginia Power have substantial ownership interests in and operate nuclear generating units; as a result, each may incursubstantial costs and liabilities. Dominions and Virginia Powers nuclear facilities are subject to operational, environmental, health and financial risks such as the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel, the ability to dispose ofsuch spent nuclear fuel, the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance available, potential operational liabilities and extended outages, the costs ofreplacement power, the costs of maintenance and the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks. Dominion and Virginia Power maintain decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage to minimize the financialexposure to these risks; however, it is possible that future decommissioning costs could exceed amounts in the decommissioning trusts and/or damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. If Dominions and Virginia Powersdecommissioning trust funds are insufficient, and they are not allowed to recover the additional costs incurred through insurance, or in the case of Virginia Power through regulatory mechanisms, their results of operations could be negativelyimpacted.  Dominions and Virginia Powers nuclear facilities are also subject to complex governmentregulation which could negatively impact their results of operations. The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generating facilities. In the event ofnoncompliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines, set license conditions, shut down a nuclear unit, or take some combination of these actions, depending on its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require Dominion and Virginia Power to make substantial expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, although the Companies have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident attheir plants, if an incident did occur, it could materially and adversely affect their results of operations and/or financial condition. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world, such as the nuclear events in Japan in 2011, couldcause the NRC to adopt increased safety regulations or otherwise limit or restrict the operation or licensing of domestic nuclear units.  Sustained declines in natural gas and NGL prices have resulted in, and could result in further, curtailments of third-party producers drilling programs, delaying the production of volumes ofnatural gas and NGLs that Dominion and Dominion Gas gather, process, and transport and reducing the value of NGLs retained by Dominion Gas, which may adversely affect Dominion and Dominion Gas revenues and earnings. Dominion and DominionGas obtain their supply of natural gas and NGLs from numerous third-party producers. Most producers are under no obligation to deliver a specific quantity of natural gas or NGLs to Dominions and Dominion Gas facilities. A number of otherfactors could reduce the volumes of natural gas and NGLs available to Dominions and Dominion Gas pipelines and other assets. Increased regulation of energy extraction activities could result in reductions in drilling for new natural gaswells, which could decrease the volumes of natural gas supplied to Dominionand Dominion Gas. Producers with direct commodity price exposure face liquidity constraints, which could present a credit risk to Dominion and Dominion Gas. Producers could shift their productionactivities to regions outside Dominions and Dominion Gas footprint. In addition, the extent of natural gas reserves and the rate of production from such reserves may be less than anticipated. If producers were to decrease the supply ofnatural gas or NGLs to Dominions and Dominion Gas systems and facilities for any reason, Dominion and Dominion Gas could experience lower revenues to the extent they are unable to replace the lost volumes on similar terms. In addition,Dominion Gas revenue from processing and fractionation operations largely results from the sale of commodities at market prices. Dominion Gas receives the wet gas product from producers and may retain the extracted NGLs as compensationfor its services. This exposes Dominion Gas to commodity price risk for the value of the spread between the NGL products and natural gas, and relative changes in these prices could adversely impact Dominion Gas results. Dominions merchant power business operates in a challenging market, which could adversely affect its results of operations andfuture growth. The success of Dominions merchant power business depends upon favorable market conditions including the ability to sell power at prices sufficient to cover its operating costs. Dominion operates in active wholesalemarkets that expose it to price volatility for electricity and fuel as well as the credit risk of counterparties. Dominion attempts to manage its price risk by entering into hedging transactions, including short-term and long-term fixed price salesand purchase contracts.  In these wholesale markets, the spot market price of electricity for each hour is generallydetermined by the cost of supplying the next unit of electricity to the market during that hour. In many cases, the next unit of electricity supplied would be provided by generating stations that consume fossil fuels, primarily natural gas.Consequently, the open market wholesale price for electricity generally reflects the cost of natural gas plus the cost to convert the fuel to electricity. Therefore, changes in the price of natural gas generally affect the open market wholesaleprice of electricity. To the extent Dominion does not enter into long-term power purchase agreements or otherwise effectively hedge its output, these changes in market prices could adversely affect its financial results. Dominion purchases fuel under a variety of terms, including long-term and short-term contracts and spot market purchases. Dominion isexposed to fuel cost volatility for the portion of its fuel obtained through short-term contracts or on the spot market, including as a result of market supply shortages. Fuel prices can be volatile and the price that can be obtained for powerproduced from such fuel may not change at the same rate as fuel costs, thus adversely impacting Dominions financial results.  In addition, in the event that any of the merchant generation facilities experience a forced outage, Dominion may not receive the level of revenue it anticipated. The Companies financial results can be adversely affected by various factors driving demand for electricity and gas and relatedservices. Technological advances required by federal laws mandate new levels of energy efficiency in end-use devices, including lighting, furnaces and electric heat pumps and could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.Additionally, certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are  29 Table of Contents   considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by a fixed date. Further, Virginia Powers business model is premised upon the cost efficiency of the production,transmission and distribution of large-scale centralized utility generation. However, advances in distributed generation technologies, such as solar cells, gas microturbines and fuel cells, may make these alternative generation methodscompetitive with large-scale utility generation, and change how customers acquire or use our services.  Reduced energydemand or significantly slowed growth in demand due to customer adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, distributed generation, regional economic conditions, or the impact of additional compliance obligations, unless substantiallyoffset through regulatory cost allocations, could adversely impact the value of the Companies business activities. Dominion Gas has experienced a decline in demand for certain of its processing services due to competing facilities operating in nearbyareas.  Dominion Gas may not be able to maintain, renew or replace its existing portfolio of customer contractssuccessfully, or on favorable terms. Upon contract expiration, customers may not elect to re-contract with Dominion Gas as a result of a variety of factors, including the amount of competition in the industry, changes in the priceof natural gas, their level of satisfaction with Dominion Gas services, the extent to which Dominion Gas is able to successfully execute its business plans and the effect of the regulatory framework on customer demand. The failure to replaceany such customer contracts on similar terms could result in a loss of revenue for Dominion Gas.  Certain of Dominionand Dominion Gas gas pipeline services are subject to long-term, fixed-price negotiated rate contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if the cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from suchcontracts. Under FERC policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a negotiated rate which may be above or below the FERC regulated, cost-based recourse rate for thatservice. These negotiated rate contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased costs which could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services. Anyshortfall of revenue as result of these negotiated rate contracts could decrease Dominion and Dominion Gas earnings and cash flows.  Exposure to counterparty performance may adversely affect the Companies financial results of operations. The Companies are exposed to credit risks of their counterparties and the risk thatone or more counterparties may fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations, including but not limited to payment for services. For example, some of Dominions operations are conducted through less than wholly-ownedsubsidiaries, such as Four Brothers and Three Cedars. In such arrangements, Dominion is dependent on third parties to fund their required share of capital expenditures. Counterparties could fail or delay the performance of theircontractual obligations for a number of reasons, including the effect of regulations on their operations. Defaults or failure to perform by customers, suppliers, joint venture partners or other third parties may adversely affect the Companiesfinancial results. Dominion will also be exposed to counterparty credit risk relating to the terminal servicesagreements for the Liquefaction Project. While the counterparties obligations are supported by parental guarantees and letters of credit, there is no assurance that such credit support would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations in theevent of a counterparty default. In addition, if a controversy arises under either agreement resulting in a judgment in Dominions favor, Dominion may need to seek to enforce a final U.S. court judgment in a foreign tribunal, which couldinvolve a lengthy process.  Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of Dominions decommissioningtrust funds and Dominions and Dominion Gas benefit plan assets or increase Dominions and Dominion Gas liabilities, which could then require significant additional funding. The performance of the capital markets affectsthe value of the assets that are held in trusts to satisfy future obligations to decommission Dominions nuclear plants and under Dominions and Dominion Gas pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Dominion andDominion Gas have significant obligations in these areas and holds significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below expected return rates. With respect to decommissioning trust funds, a decline in the market value of these assets may increase the funding requirements of theobligations to decommission Dominions nuclear plants or require additional NRC-approved funding assurance.  A decline inthe market value of the assets held in trusts to satisfy future obligations under Dominions and Dominion Gas pension and other postretirement benefit plans may increase the funding requirements under such plans. Additionally, changes ininterest rates will affect the liabilities under Dominions and Dominion Gas pension and other postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. Further, changesin demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in mortality assumptions, may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. If the decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets are negatively impacted by market fluctuations or other factors,Dominions and Dominion Gas results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows could be negatively affected.  The use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses and liquidity constraints. The Companies use derivative instruments, including futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs,to manage commodity and financial market risks. In addition, Dominion and Dominion Gas purchase and sell commodity-based contracts for hedging purposes.  The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted into law in July 2010 in an effort to improve regulation of financial markets. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions that will require certain over-the-counter derivatives,or swaps, to be centrally cleared and executed through an exchange or other approved trading platform. Non-financial entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end users, can choose to exempt their hedgingtransactions from these clearing and exchange trading requirements. Final rules for the over-the-counter derivative-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will continue to be  30     Table of Contents   established through the ongoing rulemaking process of the applicable regulators, including rules regarding margin requirements for non-cleared swaps. If, as a result of the rulemaking process,the Companies derivative activities are not exempted from the clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, the Companies could be subject to higher costs, including from higher margin requirements, for their derivative activities. Inaddition, implementation of, and compliance with, the swaps provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act by the Companies counterparties could result in increased costs related to the Companies derivative activities. Changing rating agency requirements could negatively affect the Companies growth and business strategy. In order to maintainappropriate credit ratings to obtain needed credit at a reasonable cost in light of existing or future rating agency requirements, the Companies may find it necessary to take steps or change their business plans in ways that may adversely affecttheir growth and earnings. A reduction in the Companies credit ratings could result in an increase in borrowing costs, loss of access to certain markets, or both, thus adversely affecting operating results and could require theCompanies to post additional collateral in connection with some of its price risk management activities.  Aninability to access financial markets could adversely affect the execution of the Companies business plans. The Companies rely on access to short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as significant sources of funding andliquidity for business plans with increasing capital expenditure needs, normal working capital and collateral requirements related to hedges of future sales and purchases of energy-related commodities. Deterioration in the Companiescreditworthiness, as evaluated by credit rating agencies or otherwise, or declines in market reputation either for the Companies or their industry in general, or general financial market disruptions outside of the Companies controlcould increase their cost of borrowing or restrict their ability to access one or more financial markets. Further market disruptions could stem from delays in the current economic recovery, the bankruptcy of an unrelated company, generalmarket disruption due to general credit market or political events, or the failure of financial institutions on which the Companies rely. Increased costs and restrictions on the Companies ability to access financial markets may be severeenough to affect their ability to execute their business plans as scheduled.  Potential changes in accountingpractices may adversely affect the Companies financial results. The Companies cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on public companies in general, the energy industry or theiroperations specifically. New accounting standards could be issued that could change the way they record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. These changes in accounting standards could adversely affect earnings or could increaseliabilities.  War, acts and threats of terrorism, intentional acts and other significant events could adverselyaffect the Companies operations. The Companies cannot predict the impact that any future terrorist attacks may have on the energy industry in general, or on the Companies business in particular. Any retaliatory military strikes orsustained military campaign may affect the Companies operations in unpredictable ways, such as changes in insurance markets and disruptions of fuel supplies and markets. In addition,the Companies infrastructure facilities could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror. For example, a physical attack on a critical substation in Californiaresulted in serious impacts to the power grid. Furthermore, the physical compromise of the Companies facilities could adversely affect the Companies ability to manage these facilities effectively. Instability in financial markets as aresult of terrorism, war, intentional acts, pandemic, credit crises, recession or other factors could result in a significant decline in the U.S. economy and increase the cost of insurance coverage. This could negatively impact the Companiesresults of operations and financial condition.  Hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair the Companiesoperations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information, damage the reputation of the Companies and otherwise have an adverse effect on the Companies business. The Companies own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, theoperation of which is dependent on information technology systems. Further, the computer systems that run the Companies facilities are not completely isolated from external networks. There appears to be an increasing level of activity,sophistication and maturity of threat actors, in particular nation state actors, that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system and the U.S. gas transmission or distribution system. Such parties could view the Companies computer systems,software or networks as attractive targets for cyber attack. For example, malware has been designed to target software that runs the nations critical infrastructure such as power transmission grids and gas pipelines. In addition, theCompanies businesses require that they and their vendors collect and maintain sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss. A successful cyber attack on the systems that control the Companies electric generation, electric or gas transmission ordistribution assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing the Companies from serving customers or collecting revenues. The breach of certain business systems could affect the Companies ability to correctly record, process andreport financial information. A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny anddamage to the Companies reputation. In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such ascredit monitoring. The Companies maintain property and casualty insurance that may cover certain damage caused by potential cyber incidents; however, other damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount ofany insurance available. For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could materially and adversely affect the Companies business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to attract and retain key executive officers and other appropriately qualified employees could have an adverse effect on theCompanies operations. The Companies business strategy is dependent on their ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees. The Companies key executive officers are the CEO, CFO and presidents and those responsible forfinancial, operational, legal, regulatory and accounting functions. Competition  31 Table of Contents   for skilled management employees in these areas of the Companies business operations is high. In addition, certain specialized knowledge is required of the Companies technicalemployees for transmission, generation and distribution operations. The Companies inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect their business and future operating results. An aging workforce in the energy industryalso necessitates recruiting, retaining and developing the next generation of leadership.  Dominion may be unable tocomplete the Questar Combination or, in order to do so, the combined company may be required to comply with material restrictions or conditions. On February 1, 2016, Dominion announced the execution of a merger agreement with Questar. Before theQuestar Combination may be completed, approval by the shareholders of Questar will have to be obtained. In addition, various filings must be made with various state utility, regulatory, antitrust and other authorities in the U.S. These governmentalauthorities may impose conditions on the completion, or require changes to the terms, of the transaction, including restrictions or conditions on the business, operations, or financial performance of the combined company following completion of thetransaction. Several parties have filed a complaint in court seeking to enjoin the merger. Additional parties may also seek to enjoin the merger in court or challenge regulatory filings. These conditions, changes or challenges could have the effectof delaying completion of the acquisition or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the transaction, which could have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or cashflows of the combined company and/or cause either Dominion or Questar to abandon the transaction.  If completed, the QuestarCombination may not achieve its intended results. Dominion and Questar entered into the merger agreement with the expectation that the transaction would result in various benefits, including, among other things, being accretive to earnings andadding to Dominions inventory of regulated energy infrastructure assets. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the transaction is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the business of Questar is integrated in an efficient andeffective manner. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues generated by the combined company and diversion of managements time and energy, all of which couldhave an adverse effect on the combined companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Failure tocomplete the transaction with Questar could negatively impact Dominions stock price and Dominions future business and financial results. If the Questar Combination is not completed, Dominions ongoing business and financialresults may be adversely affected and Dominion will be subject to a number of risks, including (i) Dominion may be required, under specified circumstances set forth in the Merger Agreement, to pay Questar a termination fee of $154 million; (ii)Dominion will be required to pay costs relating to the transaction, including legal, accounting, financial advisory, filing and printing costs, whether or not the transaction is completed; and (iii) execution of the Questar Combination (includingintegration planning) may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to Dominion.Dominion could also be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete thetransaction with Questar. If the transaction is not completed, these risks may materialize and may adversely affect Dominions financial position, results of operations or cash flows.    "
9,D,DOMINION ENERGY INC,2015-02-27,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
  The Companies businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyond their control. A numberof these factors have been identified below. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement or projection contained inthis report, see Forward-Looking Statements in Item 7. MD&A.  The Companies results of operations canbe affected by changes in the weather. Fluctuations in weather can affect demand for the Companies services. For example, milder than normal weather can reduce demand for electricity and gas transmission and distribution services. Inaddition, severe weather, including hurricanes, winter storms, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters can disrupt operation of the Companies facilities and cause service outages, production delays and property damage that requireincurring additional expenses. Changes in weather conditions can result in reduced water levels or changes in water temperatures that could adversely affect operations at some of the Companies power stations. Furthermore, the Companiesoperations could be adversely affected and their physical plant placed at greater risk of damage should changes in global climate produce, among other possible conditions, unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in moreintense, frequent and extreme weather events, abnormal levels of precipitation and, for operations located on or near coastlines, a change in sea level or sea temperatures.  The rates of Dominions and Dominion Gas gas transmission and distribution operations and Virginia Powers electric transmission, distribution and generation operations are subject toregulatory review. Revenue provided by Virginia Powers electric transmission, distribution and generation operations and Dominions and Dominion Gas gas transmission and distribution operations is based primarily on ratesapproved by state and federal regulatory agencies. The profitability of these businesses is dependent on their ability, through the rates that they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on their capitalinvestment.  Virginia Powers wholesale rates for electric transmission service are adjusted on an annual basis throughoperation of a FERC-approved formula rate mechanism. Through this mechanism, Virginia Powers wholesale electric transmission cost of service is estimated and thereafter adjusted to reflect Virginia Powers actual electric transmissioncosts incurred. These wholesale rates are subject to FERC review and prospective adjustment in the event that customers and/or interested state commissions file a complaint with FERC and are able to demonstrate that Virginia Powers wholesalerevenue requirement is no longer just and reasonable.  Similarly, various rates and charges assessed by Dominions andDominion Gas gas transmission businesses are subject to review by FERC. Pursuant to FERCs February 2014 approval of DTIs uncontested settlement offer, DTIs base rates for storage and transportation services are subject to amoratorium through the end of 2016. In addition, the rates of Dominions and Dominion Gas gas distribution businesses are subject to state regulatory review in the jurisdictions in which they operate. A failure by us to support theserates could result in rate decreases from current rate levels, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  Virginia Powers base rates, terms and conditions for generation and distribution services to customers in Virginia are reviewed by the Virginia Commission on a biennial basis in a  24     Table of Contents   proceeding that involves the determination of Virginia Powers actual earned ROE during a combined two-year historic test period, and the determination of Virginia Powers authorizedROE prospectively. Under certain circumstances described in the Regulation Act, Virginia Power may be required to share a portion of its earnings with customers through a refund process. Legislation signed by the Virginia Governor in February 2015 suspends biennial reviews for the five successive 12-month test periodsbeginning January 1, 2015 and ending December 31, 2019, and no changes will be made to Virginia Powers existing base rates until at least December 1, 2022. During this period, Virginia Power bears the risk of any severe weather events andnatural disasters, as well as the risk of asset impairments related to the early retirement of any generation facilities due to the implementation of the Clean Power Plan regulations, and Virginia Power may not recover its associated costs throughincreases to base rates. If Virginia Power incurs any such significant unusual expenses during this period, Virginia Power may not be able to recover its costs and/or earn a reasonable return on capital investment, which could negatively affectVirginia Powers future earnings.  Virginia Powers retail electric base rates for bundled generation, transmission,and distribution services to customers in North Carolina are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to North Carolina statutes, and the rules and procedures of the North Carolina Commission. If retail electric earnings exceedthe returns established by the North Carolina Commission, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the North Carolina Commission, which may decrease Virginia Powers future earnings. Additionally, if the NorthCarolina Commission does not allow recovery through base rates, on a timely basis, of costs incurred in providing service, Virginia Powers future earnings could be negatively impacted. The Companies are subject to complex governmental regulation, including tax regulation, that could adversely affect their results ofoperations and subject the Companies to monetary penalties. The Companies operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation and require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies.Such laws and regulations govern the terms and conditions of the services we offer, our relationships with affiliates, protection of our critical electric infrastructure assets and pipeline safety, among other matters. These operations are alsosubject to legislation governing taxation at the federal, state and local level. They must also comply with environmental legislation and associated regulations. Management believes that the necessary approvals have been obtained for existingoperations and that the business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws. The Companies businesses are subject to regulatory regimes which could result in substantial monetary penalties if any of the Companies is found not to be incompliance, including mandatory reliability standards and interaction in the wholesale markets. New laws or regulations, the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations, changes in enforcement practices of regulators, or penaltiesimposed for non-compliance with existing laws or regulations may result in substantial additional expense.Dominions and Virginia Powers generation business may be negatively affectedby possible FERC actions that could change market design in the wholesale markets or affect pricing rules or revenue calculations in the RTO markets. Dominions and Virginia Powers generation stations operating in RTO markets sellcapacity, energy and ancillary services into wholesale electricity markets regulated by FERC. The wholesale markets allow these generation stations to take advantage of market price opportunities, but also expose them to market risk. Properlyfunctioning competitive wholesale markets depend upon FERCs continuation of clearly identified market rules. From time to time FERC may investigate and authorize RTOs to make changes in market design. FERC also periodically reviewsDominions authority to sell at market-based rates. Material changes by FERC to the design of the wholesale markets or its interpretation of market rules, Dominions or Virginia Powers authority to sell power at market-based rates,or changes to pricing rules or rules involving revenue calculations, could adversely impact the future results of Dominions or Virginia Powers generation business. In addition, there have been changes to the interpretation andapplication of FERCs market manipulation rules. A failure to comply with these rules could lead to civil and criminal penalties.  The Companies infrastructure build and expansion plans often require regulatory approval before construction can commence. The Companies may not complete facility construction, pipeline,conversion or other infrastructure projects that they commence, or they may complete projects on materially different terms or timing than initially anticipated, and they may not be able to achieve the intended benefits of any such project, ifcompleted. Several facility construction, pipeline, electric transmission line, expansion, conversion and other infrastructure projects have been announced and additional projects may be considered in the future. Dominion Gas competes forprojects with companies of varying size and financial capabilities, including some that may have advantages competing for natural gas and liquid gas supplies. Commencing construction on announced and future projects may require approvals fromapplicable state and federal agencies. Projects may not be able to be completed on time as a result of weather conditions, delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory approvals, delays in obtaining key materials, labor difficulties,difficulties with partners or potential partners, a decline in the credit strength of counterparties or vendors, or other factors beyond the Companies control. Even if facility construction, pipeline, expansion, electric transmission line,conversion and other infrastructure projects are completed, the total costs of the projects may be higher than anticipated and the performance of the business of the Companies following completion of the projects may not meet expectations. Start-upand operational issues can arise in connection with the commencement of commercial operations at our facilities, including but not limited to commencement of commercial operations at our power generation facilities following expansions and fuel typeconversions to natural gas and biomass. Such issues may include failure to meet specific operating parameters, which may require adjustments to meet or amend these operating parameters. Additionally, the Companies may not be able to timely andeffectively integrate the projects into their operations and such integration may result in unforeseen operating difficulties or unanticipated costs. Further, regulators may  25 Table of Contents   disallow recovery of some of the costs of a project if they are deemed not to be prudently incurred. Any of these or other factors could adversely affect the Companies ability to realizethe anticipated benefits from the facility construction, pipeline, electric transmission line, expansion, conversion and other infrastructure projects.  The development and construction of several large-scale infrastructure projects simultaneously involves significant execution risk. The Companies are currently simultaneously developing orconstructing several major projects, including the Liquefaction Project, the Atlantic Coast Pipeline project, the strategic undergrounding project, Brunswick County, and multiple DTI producer outlet projects, which together help contribute to theover $16 billion in capital expenditures planned by the Companies through 2017. Several of the Companies key projects are increasingly large-scale, complex and being constructed in constrained geographic areas (for example, the LiquefactionProject) or in difficult terrain (for example, the Atlantic Coast Pipeline project). The advancement of the Companies ventures is also affected by the activities of stakeholder and advocacy groups, some of which oppose natural gas-related andenergy infrastructure projects. Given that these projects provide the foundation for the Companies strategic growth plan, if the Companies are unable to obtain the required approvals, develop the necessary technical expertise, allocate andcoordinate sufficient resources, adhere to budgets and timelines, effectively handle public outreach efforts, or otherwise fail to successfully execute the projects, there could be an adverse impact to the Companies financial position, resultsof operations and cash flows. Further, an inability to obtain financing or otherwise provide liquidity for the projects on acceptable terms could negatively affect the Companies financial condition, cash flows, the projects anticipatedfinancial results and/or impair the Companies ability to execute the business plan for the projects as scheduled.  Giventheir significant anticipated capital expenditures and unique attributes, the Liquefaction Project and the Atlantic Coast Pipeline project in particular are subject to significant execution risk. Cove Point Liquefaction ProjectThe Liquefaction Project, which is expected to cost approximately $2.6 billion to complete, exclusive offinancing costs, involves regulatory, construction, customer and other risks. Dominion has received the required approvals to commence construction of the Liquefaction Project from the DOE, FERC and the Maryland Commission, which are subject tocompliance with the applicable permit conditions. However, all DOE export licenses are subject to review and possible withdrawal should the DOE conclude that such export authorization is no longer in the public interest. The issuance of the FERC andMaryland approval orders has been appealed by third parties. Dominion does not know whether any existing or potential interventions or other actions by third parties will interfere with its ability to maintain such approvals, but loss of anymaterial approval could have a material adverse effect on the construction or operation of the facility. In addition, the Liquefaction Project has been the subject of litigation in the past and could be the subject of litigation in the future.Failure to comply with regulatory approval conditions or an adverse ruling in any future litigation could adversely affect Dominions ability to execute its business plan.Dominion is dependent on its contractors for the successful and timely completion of theLiquefaction Project. There is limited recent industry experience in the U.S. regarding the construction or operation of large liquefaction projects. The construction is expected to take several years, will be confined within a limited geographicarea and could be subject to delays, cost overruns, labor disputes and other factors that could cause the total cost of the project to exceed the anticipated amount and adversely affect Dominions financial performance and/or impairDominions ability to execute the business plan for the project as scheduled.  The terminal service agreements are subjectto certain conditions precedent, including maintenance of certain regulatory approvals. Because the project will have only two customers, the financial performance of the project is highly dependent on those two counterparties, whose ability toperform their obligations under the contracts is subject to factors outside Dominions control. Dominion will also be exposed to counterparty credit risk. While the counterparties obligations are supported by parental guarantees andletters of credit, there is no assurance that such credit support would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations in the event of a counterparty default. In addition, if a controversy arises under either agreement resulting in a judgment inDominions favor, Dominion may need to seek to enforce a final U.S. court judgment in a foreign tribunal, which could involve a lengthy process.  Atlantic Coast Pipeline ProjectThe Atlantic Coast Pipeline project, which will be constructed by DTI, is expected to have a total cost of approximately $4.5 to $5 billion, excluding financingcosts, and will involve significant permitting and construction risks. The project requires the approval of FERC and other federal and state agencies, which could be delayed or withheld. Dominion expects opposition from certain landowners andstakeholder groups, which could impede the acquisition of rights-of-way and other land rights on a timely basis or on acceptable terms.  The large diameter of the pipeline and difficult terrain of certain portions of the proposed pipeline route aggravate the typical construction risks with which DTI is familiar. In-service delays couldlead to cost overruns and potential customer termination rights.  Dominion owns a 45% membership interest in Atlantic CoastPipeline. Dominions lack of a controlling interest means that it has limited influence over this business. If another member were unable or otherwise failed to perform its obligations to provide capital and credit support for this business, itcould have an adverse effect on Dominions financial results.  If additional federal and/or state requirements areimposed on energy companies mandating limitations on GHG emissions or requiring efficiency improvements, such requirements may result in compliance costs that alone or in combination could make some of the Companies electric generationunits or natural gas facilities uneconomical to maintain or operate. The EPA, environmental advocacy groups, other organizations and some state and other federal agencies are focusing considerable attention on GHG emissions from power generationfacilities and their potential role in climate change. Dominion and Virginia Power expect that additional EPA regulations, and possibly additional state legislation and/or regulations, may be issued resulting in the imposition of additionallimitations on GHG emissions or requir-  26     Table of Contents   ing efficiency improvements from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units.  Compliance with GHG emission reduction requirements may require increasing the energy efficiency of equipment at facilities, committing significant capital toward carbon controls and/or reductionprograms, purchase of allowances and/or offsets, fuel switching, and/or retirement of high-emitting generation facilities and potential replacement with lower emitting generation facilities. The Clean Power Plan uses a set of measures for reducingemissions from existing sources that includes efficiency improvements at coal plants, displacing coal-fired generation with increased utilization of natural gas combined cycle units, expanding renewable resources and increasing customer energyefficiency. Compliance with the Clean Power Plans anticipated implementing regulations may require Virginia Power to prematurely retire certain generating facilities, with the potential lack or delay of cost recovery and substantially higherelectric rates, which could affect consumer demand. The cost of compliance with GHG emission legislation and/or regulation is subject to significant uncertainties due to the outcome of several interrelated assumptions and variables, including timingof the implementation of rules, required levels of reductions, allocation requirements of the new rules, the maturation and commercialization of carbon controls and/or reduction programs, and the selected compliance alternatives. Dominion andVirginia Power cannot estimate the aggregate effect of such requirements on their results of operations, financial condition or their customers. However, such expenditures, if material, could make Dominions and Virginia Powers generationfacilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect Dominions or Virginia Powers results of operations, financial performance or liquidity. There are also potential impacts on Dominions and Dominion Gas natural gas businesses as federal or stateGHG legislation or regulations may require GHG emission reductions from the natural gas sector and could affect demand for natural gas. Several regions of the U.S. have moved forward with GHG emission regulations including regions where Dominion hasoperations. For example, Rhode Island has implemented regulations requiring reductions in CO2 emissions through RGGI, a cap and trade program covering CO2 emissions from power plants in the Northeast. Additionally, GHG requirements could result in increased demand for energy conservation and renewable products. The Companies operations are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations which impose significant compliance coststo the Companies. The Companies operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources, and health and safety.Compliance with these legal requirements requires the Companies to commit significant capital toward permitting, emission fees, environmental monitoring, installation and operation of environmental control equipment and purchase of allowances and/oroffsets. Additionally, the Companies could be responsible for expenses relating to remediation and containment obligations, including at sites where they have been identified by a regulatory agency as a potentially responsible party. Expendituresrelating to environmental compliance have been significant in the past, and the Companies expect that they will remain significant in thefuture. Certain facilities have become uneconomical to operate and have been shut down, converted to new fuel types or sold. These types of events could occur again in the future. Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and/or new laws may be adopted or become applicable to the Companies. Risksrelating to expected regulation of GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units are discussed below. In addition, further regulation of air quality and GHG emissions under the CAA may be imposed on the natural gas sector,including rules to limit methane leakage. The Companies are also subject to recently finalized federal water and waste regulations, including regulations concerning cooling water intake structures, coal combustion by-product handling and disposalpractices, and the potential further regulation of polychlorinated biphenyls.  Compliance costs cannot be estimated withcertainty due to the inability to predict the requirements and timing of implementation of any new environmental rules or regulations. Other factors which affect the ability to predict future environmental expenditures with certainty include thedifficulty in estimating clean-up costs and quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all responsible parties. However, such expenditures, if material, could make the Companies facilitiesuneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect the Companies results of operations, financial performance or liquidity.  Virginia Power is subject to risks associated with the disposal and storage of coal ash. Virginia Power historically produced and continues to produce coal ash as a by-product of its coal-firedgeneration operations. The ash is stored and managed in impoundments (ash ponds) and landfills located at eight different facilities.  Virginia Power may face litigation regarding alleged CWA violations at Possum Point and Chesapeake and could incur settlement expenses and other costs, depending on the outcome of any such litigation,including costs associated with closing, corrective action and ongoing monitoring of certain ash ponds. In addition, the federal government recently signed final regulations concerning the management and storage of CCRs and Virginia and WestVirginia may impose additional regulations which would apply to the facilities identified above. Such regulations could require Virginia Power to make additional capital expenditures, increase its operating and maintenance expenses or even cause itto close certain facilities.  Further, while Virginia Power operates its ash ponds and landfills in compliance with applicablestate safety regulations, a release of coal ash with a significant environmental impact, such as the Dan River ash basin release by a neighboring utility, could result in remediation costs, civil and/or criminal penalties, claims, litigation,increased regulation and compliance costs, and reputational damage, and could impact the financial condition of Virginia Power. The Companies operations are subject to operational hazards, equipment failures, supply chain disruptions and personnel issueswhich could negatively affect the Companies. Operation of the Companies facilities involves risk, including the risk of potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure, fuel supply, pipeline integrityor transportation disruptions, accidents, labor disputes or work stoppages   27 Table of Contents   by employees, acts of terrorism or sabotage, construction delays or cost overruns, shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material and labor, operational restrictions resulting fromenvironmental limitations and governmental interventions, and performance below expected levels. The Companies businesses are dependent upon sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, the failure of which couldprevent them from accomplishing critical business functions. Because the Companies transmission facilities, pipelines and other facilities are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of their facilities and pipelines could beadversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties.  Operation of theCompanies facilities below expected capacity levels could result in lost revenues and increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs. Unplanned outages of the Companies facilities and extensions of scheduled outages due tomechanical failures or other problems occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of the Companies business. Unplanned outages typically increase the Companies operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce their revenues as aresult of selling less output or may require the Companies to incur significant costs as a result of operating higher cost units or obtaining replacement output from third parties in the open market to satisfy forward energy and capacity or othercontractual obligations. Moreover, if the Companies are unable to perform their contractual obligations, penalties or liability for damages could result.  In addition, there are many risks associated with the Companies operations and the transportation, storage and processing of natural gas and NGLs, including nuclear accidents, fires, explosions,uncontrolled release of natural gas and other environmental hazards, pole strikes, electric contact cases, the collision of third party equipment with pipelines and avian and other wildlife impacts. Such incidents could result in loss of human lifeor injuries among employees, customers or the public in general, environmental pollution, damage or destruction of facilities or business interruptions and associated public or employee safety impacts, loss of revenues, increased liabilities,heightened regulatory scrutiny and reputational risk. Further, the location of pipelines and storage facilities, or generation, transmission, substations and distribution facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercialbusiness centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks.  Dominion andVirginia Power have substantial ownership interests in and operate nuclear generating units; as a result, each may incur substantial costs and liabilities. Dominions and Virginia Powers nuclear facilities are subject tooperational, environmental, health and financial risks such as the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel, the ability to dispose of such spent nuclear fuel, the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning, limitations on the amountsand types of insurance available, potential operational liabilities and extended outages, the costs of replacement power, the costs of maintenance and the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks. Dominion and VirginiaPower maintain decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage to minimize the financial exposure to these risks; however, it is possible that future decommissioning costs could exceed amounts in the decommissioning trusts and/or damagescould exceed the amount of insurance coverage. IfDominions and Virginia Powers decommissioning trust funds are insufficient, and they are not allowed to recover the additional costs incurred through insurance, or in the case ofVirginia Power through regulatory mechanisms, their results of operations could be negatively impacted.  Dominions andVirginia Powers nuclear facilities are also subject to complex government regulation which could negatively impact their results of operations. The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirementsfor the operation of nuclear generating facilities. In the event of noncompliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines, set license conditions, shut down a nuclear unit, or take some combination of these actions, depending on its assessment ofthe severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require Dominion and Virginia Power to make substantial expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, although the Companieshave no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at their plants, if an incident did occur, it could materially and adversely affect their results of operations and/or financial condition. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere inthe world, such as the nuclear events in Japan in 2011, could cause the NRC to adopt increased safety regulations or otherwise limit or restrict the operation or licensing of domestic nuclear units. Dominion and Dominion Gas depend on third parties to produce the natural gas they gather and process, and to provide NGLs they separateinto marketable products. A reduction in these quantities could reduce Dominions and Dominion Gas revenues. Dominion and Dominion Gas obtain their supply of natural gas and NGLs from numerous third-party producers. Mostproducers are under no obligation to deliver a specific quantity of natural gas or NGLs to Dominions and Dominion Gas facilities. A number of factors could reduce the volumes of natural gas and NGLs available to Dominions andDominion Gas pipelines and other assets. Increased regulation of energy extraction activities or a decrease in natural gas prices or the availability of drilling equipment could result in reductions in drilling for new natural gas wells, whichcould decrease the volumes of natural gas supplied to Dominion and Dominion Gas. Producers could shift their production activities to regions outside Dominions and Dominion Gas footprint. In addition, the extent of natural gas reservesand the rate of production from such reserves may be less than anticipated. If producers were to decrease the supply of natural gas or NGLs to Dominions and Dominion Gas systems and facilities for any reason, Dominion and Dominion Gascould experience lower revenues to the extent they are unable to replace the lost volumes on similar terms.  Dominionsmerchant power business operates in a challenging market, which could adversely affect its results of operations and future growth. The success of Dominions merchant power business depends upon favorable market conditions including theability to sell power at prices sufficient to cover its operating costs. Dominion operates in active wholesale markets that expose it to price volatility for electricity and fuel as well as the credit risk of counterparties. Dominion attempts tomanage its price risk by entering into hedging transactions, including short-term and long-term fixed price sales and purchase contracts.  In these wholesale markets, the spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the cost of supplying the next unit of electricity to the market during that hour. In many  28     Table of Contents   cases, the next unit of electricity supplied would be provided by generating stations that consume fossil fuels, primarily natural gas. Consequently, the open market wholesale price forelectricity generally reflects the cost of natural gas plus the cost to convert the fuel to electricity. Therefore, changes in the price of natural gas generally affect the open market wholesale price of electricity. To the extent Dominion does notenter into long-term power purchase agreements or otherwise effectively hedge its output, these changes in market prices could adversely affect its financial results.  Dominion purchases fuel under a variety of terms, including long-term and short-term contracts and spot market purchases. Dominion is exposed to fuel cost volatility for the portion of its fuel obtainedthrough short-term contracts or on the spot market, including as a result of market supply shortages. Fuel prices can be volatile and the price that can be obtained for power produced from such fuel may not change at the same rate as fuel costs,thus adversely impacting Dominions financial results.  In addition, in the event that any of the merchant generationfacilities experience a forced outage, Dominion may not receive the level of revenue it anticipated.  The Companiesfinancial results can be adversely affected by various factors driving demand for electricity and gas and related services. Technological advances required by federal laws mandate new levels of energy efficiency in end-use devices, includinglighting, furnaces and electric heat pumps and could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption. Additionally, certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energyconsumption by a fixed date. Further, Virginia Powers business model is premised upon the cost efficiency of the production, transmission and distribution of large-scale centralized utility generation. However, advances in distributedgeneration technologies, such as solar cells, gas microturbines and fuel cells, may make these alternative generation methods competitive with large-scale utility generation, and change how customers acquire or use our services. Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due to customer adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation,distributed generation or regional economic conditions, unless substantially offset through regulatory cost allocations, could adversely impact the value of the Companies business activities. Dominion Gas has experienced a decline in demand for certain of its processing services due to competing facilities operating in nearbyareas.  Dominion Gas may not be able to maintain, renew or replace its existing portfolio of customer contractssuccessfully, or on favorable terms. Upon contract expiration, customers may not elect to re-contract with Dominion Gas as a result of a variety of factors, including the amount of competition in the industry, changes in the price of naturalgas, their level of satisfaction with Dominion Gas services, the extent to which Dominion Gas is able to successfully execute its business plans and the effect of the regulatory framework on customer demand. The failure to replace any suchcustomer contracts on similar terms could result in a loss of revenue for Dominion Gas.  Exposure to counterpartyperformance may adversely affect the Companies financial results of operations. The Companies are exposed to credit risks of their counterparties and the risk thatone or more counterparties may fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations, including but not limited to payment for services. Counterparties could fail or delay theperformance of their contractual obligations for a number of reasons, including the effect of regulations on their operations. Defaults by customers, suppliers, joint venture partners or other third parties may adversely affect the Companiesfinancial results.  In addition, in an economic downturn, individual customers of East Ohio may have increased amounts of baddebt. While rate riders have been obtained so that those losses will, for the most part, be recovered by future rates, such recovery will be over a period of time, while the cost is incurred earlier by East Ohio. Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of Dominions decommissioning trust funds and Dominions andDominion Gas benefit plan assets or increase Dominions and Dominion Gas liabilities, which could then require significant additional funding. The performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are heldin trusts to satisfy future obligations to decommission Dominions nuclear plants and under Dominions and Dominion Gas pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Dominion and Dominion Gas have significant obligations in theseareas and holds significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below expected return rates.  With respect to decommissioning trust funds, a decline in the market value of these assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations to decommission Dominions nuclear plants orrequire additional NRC-approved funding assurance.  A decline in the market value of the assets held in trusts to satisfyfuture obligations under Dominions and Dominion Gas pension and other postretirement benefit plans may increase the funding requirements under such plans. Additionally, changes in interest rates will affect the liabilities underDominions and Dominion Gas pension and other postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers ofretirements or changes in mortality assumptions, may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  If the decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets are negatively impacted by market fluctuations or other factors, Dominions and Dominion Gas results of operations, financialcondition and/or cash flows could be negatively affected.  The use of derivative instruments could result infinancial losses and liquidity constraints. The Companies use derivative instruments, including futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs, to manage commodity and financial market risks. In addition, Dominion and Dominion Gas purchase and sellcommodity-based contracts for hedging purposes.  The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted into law in July 2010 in an effort to improveregulation of financial markets. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions that will require certain over-the-counter derivatives, or swaps, to be centrally cleared and executed through an exchange or other approved trading platform. Non-financialentities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end users, can choose to exempt their hedging transactions from these clearing and exchange trading  29 Table of Contents   requirements. Final rules for the over-the-counter derivative-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will continue to be established through the ongoing rulemaking process of the applicableregulators, including rules regarding margin requirements for non-cleared swaps. If, as a result of the rulemaking process, the Companies derivative activities are not exempted from the clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, theCompanies could be subject to higher costs, including from higher margin requirements, for their derivative activities. In addition, implementation of, and compliance with, the swaps provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act by the Companiescounterparties could result in increased costs related to the Companies derivative activities.  Changing rating agencyrequirements could negatively affect the Companies growth and business strategy. In order to maintain appropriate credit ratings to obtain needed credit at a reasonable cost in light of existing or future rating agency requirements, theCompanies may find it necessary to take steps or change their business plans in ways that may adversely affect their growth and earnings. A reduction in the Companies credit ratings could result in an increase in borrowing costs, loss ofaccess to certain markets, or both, thus adversely affecting operating results and could require the Companies to post additional collateral in connection with some of its price risk management activities. Dominion Gas depends, in part, on an intercompany credit agreement with Dominion and certain bank syndicated credit facilitiesavailable to Dominion and Dominion Gas for short-term borrowings to meet working capital needs. If Dominions short-term funding resources, which include the commercial paper market and its syndicated bank credit facilities, becomeunavailable to Dominion, Dominion Gas access to short-term funding could also be in jeopardy. Dominion Gas relies, in part, on an IRCA with Dominion to provide Dominion Gas, and its subsidiaries, with short-term borrowings to meet workingcapital and other cash needs. Dominion relies, in part, on the issuance of commercial paper in the short-term money markets to fund advances it makes to Dominion Gas under the IRCA. The issuance of commercial paper by Dominion is supported by itsaccess to two bank syndicated revolving credit facilities. In addition, these facilities could be drawn upon either by Dominion Gas directly or by Dominion to fund Dominion Gas borrowing requests under the IRCA. In the event of a default under the bank syndicated credit facilities by any of the Companies, Dominion could lose access to thesefacilities. In such an event, Dominion may not be able to rely on either the commercial paper market or the bank facility for its own short-term funding, and thus may not be able to fund a request by Dominion Gas under the IRCA. An inability to access financial markets could adversely affect the execution of the Companies business plans. TheCompanies rely on access to short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as significant sources of funding and liquidity for business plans with increasing capital expenditure needs, normal working capital and collateral requirementsrelated to hedges of future sales and purchases of energy-related commodities. Deterioration in the Companies creditworthiness, as evaluated by credit rating agencies or otherwise, or declines in market reputation either for the Companies ortheir industry in general, or general financial market disruptions outside of the Companiescontrol could increase their cost of borrowing or restrict their ability to access one or more financial markets. Further market disruptions could stem from delays in the current economicrecovery, the bankruptcy of an unrelated company, general market disruption due to general credit market or political events, or the failure of financial institutions on which the Companies rely. Increased costs and restrictions on theCompanies ability to access financial markets may be severe enough to affect their ability to execute their business plans as scheduled.  Potential changes in accounting practices may adversely affect the Companies financial results. The Companies cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards orpractices may have on public companies in general, the energy industry or their operations specifically. New accounting standards could be issued that could change the way they record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. These changes inaccounting standards could adversely affect earnings or could increase liabilities.  War, acts and threats of terrorism,natural disasters and other significant events could adversely affect the Companies operations. The Companies cannot predict the impact that any future terrorist attacks may have on the energy industry in general, or on the Companiesbusiness in particular. Any retaliatory military strikes or sustained military campaign may affect the Companies operations in unpredictable ways, such as changes in insurance markets and disruptions of fuel supplies and markets. In addition,the Companies infrastructure facilities could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror. For example, a physical attack on a critical substation in California resulted in serious impacts to the power grid. Furthermore,the physical compromise of the Companies facilities could adversely affect the Companies ability to manage these facilities effectively. Instability in financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, natural disasters, pandemic, creditcrises, recession or other factors could result in a significant decline in the U.S. economy and increase the cost of insurance coverage. This could negatively impact the Companies results of operations and financial condition. Hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair the Companies operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information,damage the reputation of the Companies and otherwise have an adverse effect on the Companies business. The Companies own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems.Further, the computer systems that run the Companies facilities are not completely isolated from external networks. There appears to be an increasing level of activity, sophistication and maturity of threat actors, in particular nation stateactors, that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system and the U.S. gas transmission or distribution system. Such parties could view the Companies computer systems, software or networks as attractive targets for cyber attack. For example,malware has been designed to target software that runs the nations critical infrastructure such as power transmission grids and gas pipelines. In addition, the Companies businesses require that they and their vendors collect and maintainsensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss.  30     Table of Contents   A successful cyber attack on the systems that control the Companies electricgeneration, electric or gas transmission or distribution assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing the Companies from serving customers or collecting revenues. The breach of certain business systems could affect theCompanies ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines,other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to the Companies reputation. In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significantbreach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring. The Companies maintain property and casualty insurance that may cover certain damage caused by potential cyber incidents; however, other damage and claims arising fromsuch incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available. For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could materially and adversely affect the Companies business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to retain and attract key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have anadverse effect on the Companies operations. The Companies business strategy is dependent on their ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees. The Companies key executive officers are the CEO, CFO and presidents and thoseresponsible for financial, operational, legal, regulatory and accounting functions. Competition for skilled management employees in these areas of the Companies business operations is high. In addition, demand for skilled professional andtechnical employees in gas transmission, storage, gathering, processing and distribution and in design and construction is high in light of growth in demand for natural gas, increased supply of natural gas as a result of developments in gasproduction, increased infrastructure projects, increased risk in certain areas of the business, such as cybersecurity, and increased regulation of these activities. The Companies inability to retain and attract these employees could adverselyaffect their business and future operating results. An aging workforce in the energy industry also necessitates recruiting, retaining and developing the next generation of leadership.    "
14,D,DOMINION ENERGY INC,2014-02-28,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
  Dominion and Virginia Powers businessesare influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyond their control. A number of these factors have been identified below. For other factors that may causeactual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement or projection contained in this report, see Forward-Looking Statements in Item 7. MD&A. Dominions and Virginia Powers results of operations can be affected by changes in the weather. In addition, severeweather, including hurricanes, floods and winter storms, can be destructive, causing outages and property damage that require incurring additional expenses. Changes in weather conditions can result in reduced water levels or changes in watertemperatures that could adversely affect operations at some of the Companies power stations. Furthermore, the Companies operations could be adversely affected and their physical plant placed at greater risk of damage should changes inglobal climate produce, among other possible conditions, unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, abnormal levels of precipitation and, for operations located on or nearcoastlines, a change in sea level or sea temperatures.  The rates of Dominions gas transmission and distributionoperations and Virginia Powers electric transmission, dis-  23  Table of Contents   tribution and generation operations are subject to regulatory review. Revenue provided by Virginia Powers electric transmission, distribution and generation operations andDominions gas transmission and distribution operations is based primarily on rates approved by state and federal regulatory agencies. The profitability of these businesses is dependent on their ability, through the rates that they arepermitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on their capital investment.  Virginia Powerswholesale rates for electric transmission service are adjusted on an annual basis through operation of a FERC-approved formula rate mechanism. Through this mechanism, Virginia Powers wholesale electric transmission cost of service is estimatedand thereafter adjusted to reflect Virginia Powers actual electric transmission costs incurred. These wholesale rates are subject to FERC review and prospective adjustment in the event that customers and/or interested state commissions file acomplaint with FERC and are able to demonstrate that Virginia Powers wholesale revenue requirement is no longer just and reasonable.  Similarly, various rates and charges assessed by Dominions gas transmission businesses are subject to review by FERC. In addition, the rates of Dominions gas distribution businesses aresubject to state regulatory review in the jurisdictions in which they operate.  Virginia Powers base rates, terms andconditions for generation and distribution services to customers in Virginia are reviewed by the Virginia Commission on a biennial basis in a proceeding that involves the determination of Virginia Powers actual earned ROE during a combinedtwo-year historic test period, and the determination of Virginia Powers authorized ROE prospectively. Under certain circumstances described in the Regulation Act, Virginia Power may be required to share a portion of its earnings with customersthrough a refund process, and the Virginia Commission may order a base rate increase or reduction during the biennial review. As a result, Virginia Power may potentially not fully recover costs associated with these existing rate adjustment clauses. Virginia Powers retail electric base rates for bundled generation, transmission, and distribution services to customersin North Carolina are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to North Carolina statutes, and the rules and procedures of the North Carolina Commission. If retail electric earnings exceed the returns established by the NorthCarolina Commission, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the North Carolina Commission, which may decrease Virginia Powers future earnings. Additionally, if the North Carolina Commission does not allowrecovery through base rates, on a timely basis, of costs incurred in providing service, Virginia Powers future earnings could be negatively impacted.  Dominion and Virginia Power are subject to complex governmental regulation, including tax regulation, that could adversely affect their results of operations and subject the Companies to monetarypenalties. Dominions and Virginia Powers operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation and require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies. These operations are alsosubject to legislation governing taxation at the federal, state and local level. They must also comply with environmentallegis-lation and associated regulations. Management believes that the necessary approvals have been obtained for existing operations and that the business is conducted in accordance with applicablelaws. The Companies businesses are subject to regulatory regimes which could result in substantial monetary penalties if either Dominion or Virginia Power is found not to be in compliance, including mandatory reliability standards andinteraction in the wholesale markets. New laws or regulations, the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations, or penalties imposed for non-compliance with existing laws or regulations may result in substantial expense. Dominions and Virginia Powers generation business may be negatively affected by possible FERC actions that could changemarket design in the wholesale markets or affect pricing rules or revenue calculations in the RTO markets. Dominions and Virginia Powers generation stations operating in RTO markets sell capacity, energy and ancillary services intowholesale electricity markets regulated by FERC. The wholesale markets allow these generation stations to take advantage of market price opportunities, but also expose them to market risk. Properly functioning competitive wholesale markets dependupon FERCs continuation of clearly identified market rules. From time to time FERC may investigate and authorize RTOs to make changes in market design. FERC also periodically reviews Dominions authority to sell at market-based rates.Material changes by FERC to the design of the wholesale markets or its interpretation of market rules, Dominions or Virginia Powers authority to sell power at market-based rates, or changes to pricing rules or rules involving revenuecalculations, could adversely impact the future results of Dominions or Virginia Powers generation business. Dominion and Virginia Power infrastructure build plans often require regulatory approval before construction can commence. Dominion andVirginia Power may not complete plant construction, conversion or expansion projects that they commence, or they may complete projects on materially different terms or timing than initially anticipated, and they may not be able toachieve the intended benefits of any such project, if completed. Several plant construction, conversion and expansion projects have been announced and additional projects may be considered in the future. Commencing construction on announcedplants requires approvals from applicable state and federal agencies. Projects may not be able to be completed on time as a result of weather conditions, delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory approvals, delays in obtaining keymaterials, labor difficulties, difficulties with partners or potential partners, a decline in the credit strength of their counterparties or vendors, or other factors beyond their control. Even if plant construction, conversion and expansionprojects are completed, the total costs of the projects may be higher than anticipated and the performance of the business of Dominion and Virginia Power following the projects may not meet expectations. Start-up and operational issues can arise inconnection with the commencement of commercial operations at our facilities, including but not limited to commencement of commercial operations at our power generation facilities following expansions and fuel type conversions to natural gas andbiomass. Such issues may include failure to meet specific operating parameters, which may require adjustments to meet or amend these operating parameters. Additionally, Dominion and Virginia Power may not be able to timely  24     Table of Contents   and effectively integrate the projects into their operations and such integration may result in unforeseen operating difficulties or unanticipated costs. Further, regulators may disallow recoveryof some of the costs of a project if they are deemed not to be prudently incurred. Any of these or other factors could adversely affect the Companies ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the plant construction, conversion andexpansion projects.  Dominions and Virginia Powers current costs of compliance with environmental laws aresignificant. The costs of compliance with future environmental laws, including laws and regulations designed to address global climate change, air quality, coal combustion by-products, cooling water and other matters could make certain of theCompanies generation facilities uneconomical to maintain or operate. Dominions and Virginia Powers operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to airquality, water quality, waste management, natural resources, and health and safety. Compliance with these legal requirements requires the Companies to commit significant capital toward permitting, emission fees, environmental monitoring,installation and operation of pollution control equipment and purchase of allowances and/or offsets. Additionally, the Companies could be responsible for expenses relating to remediation and containment obligations, including at sites where theyhave been identified by a regulatory agency as a potentially responsible party. Expenditures relating to environmental compliance have been significant in the past, and Dominion and Virginia Power expect that they will remain significant in thefuture. Certain facilities have become uneconomical to operate and have been shut down, converted to new fuel types or sold. These types of events could occur again in the future. Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and/or new laws may be adopted or become applicable to Dominion or VirginiaPower. The EPA is expected to issue additional regulations with respect to air quality under the CAA, including revised NAAQS and regulations governing the emissions of GHGs from electric generating units. Additional regulation of air quality andGHG emissions under the CAA may be imposed on the natural gas sector, including rules to limit methane leakage. Compliance with GHG emission reduction requirements may require the retrofit or replacement of equipment or could otherwise increase thecost to operate and maintain our facilities. Risks relating to potential regulation of GHG emissions are discussed below. Dominion and Virginia Power also expect additional federal water and waste regulations, including regulations concerningcooling water intake structures and coal combustion by-product handling and disposal practices that are expected to be applicable to at least some of its generating facilities.  Compliance costs cannot be estimated with certainty due to the inability to predict the requirements and timing of implementation of any new environmental rules or regulations. Other factors which affectthe ability to predict future environmental expenditures with certainty include the difficulty in estimating clean-up costs and quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all responsible parties.However, such expenditures, if material, could make the Companies facilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect Dominions or Virginia Powers results of operations, financialperformance or liquidity. If additional federal and/or state requirements are imposed on energy companiesmandating limitations on GHG emissions or requiring efficiency improvements, such requirements may result in compliance costs that alone or in combination could make some of Dominions or Virginia Powers electric generation unitsor natural gas facilities uneconomical to maintain or operate. The EPA, environmental advocacy groups, other organizations and some state and other federal agencies are focusing considerable attention on GHG emissions from power generationfacilities and their potential role in climate change. Dominion and Virginia Power expect that additional EPA regulations, and possibly additional state legislation and/or regulations, may be issued resulting in the imposition of additionallimitations on GHG emissions or requiring efficiency improvements from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units.  There are also potential impacts on Dominions natural gas businesses as federal or state GHG legislation or regulations may require GHG emission reductions from the natural gas sector and couldaffect demand for natural gas. Additionally, GHG requirements could result in increased demand for energy conservation and renewable products. Several regions of the U.S. have moved forward with GHG emission regulations including regions whereDominion has operations. For example, Rhode Island has implemented regulations requiring reductions in CO2 emissions through RGGI, a cap and trade program covering CO2 emissions from power plants in the Northeast.  Compliance with GHG emissionreduction requirements may require increasing the energy efficiency of equipment at facilities, committing significant capital toward carbon capture and storage technology, purchase of allowances and/or offsets, fuel switching, and/or retirement ofhigh-emitting generation facilities and potential replacement with lower emitting generation facilities. The cost of compliance with GHG emission legislation and/or regulation is subject to significant uncertainties due to the outcome of severalinterrelated assumptions and variables, including timing of the implementation of rules, required levels of reductions, allocation requirements of the new rules, the maturation and commercialization of carbon capture and storage technology, and theselected compliance alternatives. The Companies cannot estimate the aggregate effect of such requirements on their results of operations, financial condition or their customers. However, such expenditures, if material, could make the Companiesgeneration facilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect Dominions or Virginia Powers results of operations, financial performance or liquidity. Dominions and Virginia Powers operations are subject to operational hazards, equipment failures, supply chain disruptionsand personnel issues which could negatively affect the Companies. Operation of the Companies facilities involves risk, including the risk of potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure, fuel supplyor transportation disruptions, accidents, labor disputes or work stoppages by employees, acts of terrorism or sabotage, construction delays or cost overruns, shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material and labor, operational restrictionsresulting from environmental limitations and governmental interventions, and performance below expected levels. The Companies businesses are dependent upon sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, the failure ofwhich could prevent   25  Table of Contents   them from accomplishing critical business functions. In addition, weather-related incidents, earthquakes and other natural disasters can disrupt operation of the Companies facilities.Because Virginia Powers transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of its facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties. Operation of the Companies facilities below expected capacity levels could result in lost revenues and increasedexpenses, including higher maintenance costs. Unplanned outages of the Companies facilities and extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of theCompanies business. Unplanned outages typically increase the Companies operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce their revenues as a result of selling less output or may require the Companies to incur significant costs as aresult of operating higher cost units or obtaining replacement output from third parties in the open market to satisfy forward energy and capacity or other contractual obligations. Moreover, if the Companies are unable to perform theircontractual obligations, penalties or liability for damages could result.  In addition, there are many risks associated withthe Companies operations, including nuclear accidents, fires, explosions, uncontrolled release of natural gas and other environmental hazards, pole strikes, electric contact cases and avian impacts. Such incidents could result in loss of humanlife or injuries among employees, customers or the public in general, environmental pollution, damage or destruction of facilities or business interruptions and associated public or employee safety impacts, loss of revenues, increased liabilities,heightened regulatory scrutiny and reputational risk.  Dominion and Virginia Power have substantial ownership interests inand operate nuclear generating units; as a result, each may incur substantial costs and liabilities. Dominions and Virginia Powers nuclear facilities are subject to operational, environmental, health and financial risks suchas the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel, the ability to dispose of such spent nuclear fuel, the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance available, potential operationalliabilities and extended outages, the costs of replacement power, the costs of maintenance and the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks. Dominion and Virginia Power maintain decommissioning trusts and externalinsurance coverage to minimize the financial exposure to these risks; however, it is possible that future decommissioning costs could exceed amounts in the decommissioning trusts and/or damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. IfDominions and Virginia Powers decommissioning trust funds are insufficient, and they are not allowed to recover the additional costs incurred through insurance, or in the case of Virginia Power through regulatory mechanisms, theirresults of operations could be negatively impacted.  Dominions and Virginia Powers nuclear facilities are alsosubject to complex government regulation which could negatively impact their results of operations. The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generating facilities.In the event of noncompliance, the NRC has the authority to imposefines, set license conditions, shut down a nuclear unit, or take some combination of these actions, depending on its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require Dominion and Virginia Power to make substantial expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, although the Companies have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident attheir plants, if an incident did occur, it could materially and adversely affect their results of operations and/or financial condition. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world, such as the nuclear events in Japan in 2011, couldcause the NRC to adopt increased safety regulations or otherwise limit or restrict the operation or licensing of domestic nuclear units.  Dominion depends on third parties to produce the natural gas it gathers and processes, and to provide the NGLs that it separates into marketable products. A reductionin these quantities could reduce Dominions revenues. Dominion obtains its supply of natural gas and NGLs from numerous third-party producers. Such producers are under no obligation to deliver a specific quantity of naturalgas or NGLs to Dominions facilities, although the producers that have contracted to supply natural gas to the Natrium natural gas processing and fractionation facility are subject to contractual minimum fee payments. Natrium is owned by BlueRacer. If producers were to decrease the supply of natural gas or NGLs for any reason to systems and facilities in which Dominion has an interest, Dominion could experience lower revenues to the extent it is unable to replace the lost volumes onsimilar terms.  The development, construction and operation of the Cove Point liquefaction project would involve significantrisks. As described in greater detail in Future Issues and Other Matters, Dominion intends to invest significant financial resources in the liquefaction project, subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals. An inability to obtainfinancing or otherwise provide liquidity for the project on acceptable terms could negatively affect Dominions financial condition, cash flows, the projects anticipated financial results and/or impair Dominions ability to executethe business plan for the project as scheduled.  The project remains subject to FERC and other federal and state approvals. TheDOE has authorized Dominion to export LNG to non-free trade agreement countries, however, all DOE export licenses are subject to review and possible withdrawal should the DOE conclude that such export authorization is no longer in the publicinterest, which could have a material adverse effect on the construction or operation of the facility. In addition, the liquefaction project has been the subject of litigation which, although decided in Dominions favor, is the subject of anappeal. A delay in receipt of project approvals or an adverse ruling by an appellate court could adversely affect Dominions ability to execute its business plan.  There is limited recent industry experience in the U.S. regarding the construction or operation of large liquefaction projects. The construction of the facility is expected to take several years, will beconfined within a limited geographic area and could be subject to delays, cost overruns, labor disputes and other factors that could cause the total cost of the project to exceed the anticipated amount and adversely affect Dominions financialperformance and/or impair Dominions ability to execute the business plan for the project as scheduled.   26     Table of Contents   There are significant customer risks associated with the project. The terminal serviceagreements are subject to certain conditions precedent, including receipt of regulatory approvals. Dominion will also be exposed to counterparty credit risk. While the counterparties obligations are supported by parental guarantees and lettersof credit, there is no assurance that such credit support would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations in the event of a counterparty default. In addition, if a controversy arises under either agreement resulting in a judgment in Dominionsfavor, Dominion may need to seek to enforce a final U.S. court judgment in a foreign tribunal, which could involve a lengthy process.  Assuming current commodity price trends continue, if Dominion is unable to pursue the liquefaction project, Dominion may not be able to offset the prospective revenue reductions associated with theexisting import contracts as described in Future Issues and Other Matters, which could have a negative impact on its results of operations.  Dominions merchant power business is operating in a challenging market, which could adversely affect its results of operations and future growth. The success of Dominionsmerchant power business depends upon favorable market conditions including the ability to sell power at prices sufficient to cover its operating costs. Dominion operates in active wholesale markets that expose it to price volatility for electricityand fuel as well as the credit risk of counterparties. Dominion attempts to manage its price risk by entering into hedging transactions, including short-term and long-term fixed price sales and purchase contracts. In these wholesale markets, the spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the cost of supplying the nextunit of electricity to the market during that hour. In many cases, the next unit of electricity supplied would be provided by generating stations that consume fossil fuels, primarily natural gas. Consequently, the open market wholesale price forelectricity generally reflects the cost of natural gas plus the cost to convert the fuel to electricity. Therefore, changes in the price of natural gas generally affect the open market wholesale price of electricity. To the extent Dominion does notenter into long-term power purchase agreements or otherwise effectively hedge its output, these changes in market prices could adversely affect its financial results.  Dominion purchases fuel under a variety of terms, including long-term and short-term contracts and spot market purchases. Dominion is exposed to fuel cost volatility for the portion of its fuel obtainedthrough short-term contracts or on the spot market, including as a result of market supply shortages. Fuel prices can be volatile and the price that can be obtained for power produced from such fuel may not change at the same rate as fuel costs,thus adversely impacting Dominions financial results.  Dominions and Virginia Powers financialresults can be adversely affected by various factors driving demand for electricity and gas. Technological advances required by federal laws mandate new levels of energy efficiency in end-use devices, including lighting, furnacesand electric heat pumps and could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption. Additionally, certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by a fixeddate. Further, Virginia Powers business model is premised upon the cost efficiency of the production, transmission and distribution of large-scale centralized utilitygeneration. However, advances in distributed generation technologies, such as solar cells, gas microturbines and fuel cells, may make these alternative generation methods competitive withlarge-scale utility generation, and change how customers acquire or use our services.  Reduced energy demand or significantlyslowed growth in demand due to customer adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, distributed generation or regional economic conditions, unless substantially offset through regulatory cost allocations, could adversely impact the valueof the Companies business activities.  Exposure to counterparty performance may adversely affect the Companiesfinancial results of operations. Dominion and Virginia Power are exposed to credit risks of their counterparties and the risk that one or more counterparties may fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations, including but notlimited to payment for services. Counterparties could fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations for a number of reasons, including the effect of regulations on their operations. Such defaults by customers, suppliers, jointventure partners or other third parties may adversely affect the Companies financial results.  Market performance andother changes may decrease the value of decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets or increase Dominions liabilities, which could then require significant additional funding. The performance of the capital markets affects thevalue of the assets that are held in trusts to satisfy future obligations to decommission Dominions nuclear plants and under its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Dominion has significant obligations in these areas and holdssignificant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below expected return rates.  With respect to decommissioning trust funds, a decline in the market value of these assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations to decommission Dominions nuclear plants orrequire additional NRC-approved funding assurance.  A decline in the market value of the assets held in trusts to satisfyfuture obligations under Dominions pension and other postretirement benefit plans may increase the funding requirements under such plans. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under Dominions pension and otherpostretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, mayalso increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  Ifthe decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets are negatively impacted by market fluctuations or other factors, Dominions results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows could be negatively affected. The use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses and liquidity constraints. Dominion and Virginia Poweruse derivative instruments, including futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs, to manage commodity and financial market risks. In addition, Dominion purchases and sells commodity-based contracts for hedging exposures from its business units. TheCompanies could recognize financial losses on these contracts,   27 Table of Contents   including as a result of volatility in the market values of the underlying commodities, if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract or upon the failure or insolvency of a financialintermediary, exchange or clearinghouse used to enter, execute or clear these transactions. In the absence of actively-quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these contracts involves managementsjudgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the under-lying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts. The use of derivatives to hedge future sales may limit the benefit Dominion would otherwise receive from increases in commodity prices.These hedge arrangements generally include collateral requirements that require Dominion to deposit funds or securities or post letters of credit with counterparties, financial intermediaries or clearinghouses to cover the fair value of coveredcontracts in excess of agreed upon credit limits. For instance, when commodity prices rise to levels substantially higher than the levels where it has hedged future sales, Dominion may be required to use a material portion of its available liquidityor obtain additional liquidity to cover these collateral requirements. In some circumstances, this could have a compounding effect on Dominions financial liquidity and results of operations. In addition, the availability or security of thecollateral delivered by Dominion may be adversely affected by the failure or insolvency of a financial intermediary, exchange or clearinghouse used to enter, execute or clear these types of transactions. Derivatives designated under hedge accounting, to the extent not fully offset by the hedged transaction, can result in ineffectivenesslosses. These losses primarily result from differences between the location and/or specifications of the derivative hedging instrument and the hedged item and could adversely affect Dominions results of operations. Dominions and Virginia Powers operations in regards to these transactions are subject to multiple market risks includingmarket liquidity, price volatility, credit strength of the Companies counterparties and the financial condition of the financial intermediaries, exchanges and clearinghouses used for the types of transactions. These market risks are beyond theCompanies control and could adversely affect their results of operations, liquidity and future growth.  The Dodd-FrankAct was enacted into law in July 2010 in an effort to improve regulation of financial markets. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions that will require certain over-the-counter derivatives, or swaps, to be centrally cleared and executed through anexchange or other approved trading platform. Non-financial entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end users, can choose to exempt their hedging transactions from these clearing and exchange tradingrequirements. Final rules for the over-the-counter derivative-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will continue to be established through the ongoing rulemaking process of the applicable regulators, including rules regarding margin requirementsfor non-cleared swaps. If, as a result of the rulemaking process, Dominions or Virginia Powers derivative activities are not exempted from the clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, the Companies could be subject to highercosts, including from higher margin requirements, for their derivative activities. In addition, implementation of, and compliance with, the swaps provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act bythe Companies counterparties could result in increased costs related to the Companies derivative activities.  Changing rating agency requirements could negatively affect Dominions and Virginia Powers growth and business strategy. In order to maintain appropriate credit ratings to obtain neededcredit at a reasonable cost in light of existing or future rating agency requirements, Dominion and Virginia Power may find it necessary to take steps or change their business plans in ways that may adversely affect their growth and earnings. Areduction in Dominions credit ratings or the credit ratings of Virginia Power could result in an increase in borrowing costs, loss of access to certain markets, or both, thus adversely affecting operating results and could require Dominion topost additional collateral in connection with some of its price risk management activities.  An inability to accessfinancial markets could adversely affect the execution of Dominions and Virginia Powers business plans. Dominion and Virginia Power rely on access to short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as significantsources of funding and liquidity for capital expenditures, normal working capital and collateral requirements related to hedges of future sales and purchases of energy-related commodities. Deterioration in the Companies creditworthiness, asevaluated by credit rating agencies or otherwise, or declines in market reputation either for the Companies or their industry in general, or general financial market disruptions outside of Dominions and Virginia Powers control couldincrease their cost of borrowing or restrict their ability to access one or more financial markets. Further market disruptions could stem from delays in the current economic recovery, the bankruptcy of an unrelated company, general market disruptiondue to general credit market or political events, or the failure of financial institutions on which the Companies rely. Increased costs and restrictions on the Companies ability to access financial markets may be severe enough to affect theirability to execute their business plans as scheduled.  Potential changes in accounting practices may adversely affectDominions and Virginia Powers financial results. Dominion and Virginia Power cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on public companies in general, the energy industry or theiroperations specifically. New accounting standards could be issued that could change the way they record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. These changes in accounting standards could adversely affect earnings or could increase liabilities. War, acts and threats of terrorism, natural disasters and other significant events could adversely affect Dominionsand Virginia Powers operations. Dominion and Virginia Power cannot predict the impact that any future terrorist attacks may have on the energy industry in general, or on the Companies business in particular. Any retaliatory militarystrikes or sustained military campaign may affect the Companies operations in unpredictable ways, such as changes in insurance markets and disruptions of fuel supplies and markets. In addition, the Companies infrastructure facilitiescould be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror. Furthermore, the physical compromise of the Companies facilities could adversely affect the Companies ability to manage these facilities effectively. Instability infinancial markets as a result of terrorism, war, natural disasters, pandemic, credit crises, recession or other factors could result in a significant decline in the U.S. economy and increase the cost of insurance coverage. This could  28     Table of Contents   negatively impact the Companies results of operations and financial condition.  Hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair Dominions and Virginia Powers operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information, damage the reputation of the Companies andotherwise have an adverse effect on Dominions and Virginia Powers business. The Companies own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems. Further, the computersystems that run the Companies facilities are not completely isolated from external networks. Parties that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system or the Companies operations could view the Companies computer systems, softwareor networks as attractive targets for cyber attack. In addition, the Companies businesses require that they collect and maintain sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject toelectronic theft or loss.  A successful cyber attack on the systems that control the Companies electric generation,electric or gas transmission or distribution assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing the Companies from serving customers or collecting revenues. The breach of certain business systems could affect the Companies abilityto correctly record, process and report financial information. A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action,heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to the Companies reputation. In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notificationexpenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring. The Companies maintain property and casualty insurance that may cover certain damage caused by potential cyber incidents, however, other damage and claims arising from such incidents maynot be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available. For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could materially and adversely affect the Companies business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to retain and attract key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverseeffect on Dominions and Virginia Powers operations. Dominions and Virginia Powers business strategy is dependent on their ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees. Competition for skilled employees in some areasis high and the inability to retain and attract these employees could adversely affect their business and future operating results. An aging workforce in the energy industry necessitates recruiting, retaining and developing the next generation ofleadership.     "
7,D,DOMINION ENERGY INC,2013-02-28,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
  Dominions and Virginia Powers businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyondtheir control. A number of these factors have been identified below. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement or projection contained in this report, seeForward-Looking Statements in Item 7. MD&A.  Dominions andVirginia Powers results of operations can be affected by changes in the weather. Weather conditions directly influence thedemand for electricity and natural gas, and affect the price of energy commodities. In addition, severe weather, including hurricanes and winter storms, can be destructive, causing outages and property damage that require incurring additionalexpenses. Changes in weather conditions can result in reduced water levels or changes in water temperatures that could adversely affect operations at some of the Companies power stations. Furthermore, the Companies operations could beadversely affected and their physical plant placed at greater risk of damage should changes in global climate produce, among other possible conditions, unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent andextreme weather events, abnormal levels of precipitation and, for operations located on or near coastlines, a change in sea level or sea temperatures.  The rates of Dominions gas transmission and distribution operations and Virginia Powers electric transmission, distribution and generationoperations are subject to regulatory review. Revenue provided by Virginia Powers electric transmission, distribution andgeneration operations and Dominions gas transmission and distribution operations is based primarily on rates approved by state and federal regulatory agencies. The profitability of these businesses is dependent on their ability, through therates that they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on their capital investment.  Virginia Powers wholesale rates for electric transmission service are adjusted on an annual basis through operation of a FERC-approved formula rate mechanism. Through this mechanism, VirginiaPowers wholesale electric transmission cost of service is estimated and thereafter adjusted to reflect Virginia Powers actual electric transmission costs incurred. These wholesale rates are subject to FERC review and prospectiveadjustment in the event that customers and/or interested state commissions file a complaint with FERC and are able to demonstrate that Virginia Powers wholesale revenue requirement is no longer just and reasonable. Similarly, various rates and charges assessed by Dominions gas transmission businesses are subject to review by FERC. In addition,the rates of Dominions gas distribution businesses are subject to state regulatory review in the jurisdictions in which they operate.  Virginia Powers base rates, terms and conditions for generation and distribution services to customers in Virginia are reviewed by the Virginia Commission on a biennial basis in a proceeding thatinvolves the determination of Virginia Powers actual earned ROE during a combined two-year historic test period, and the determination of Virginia Powers authorized ROE prospectively. Under certain circumstances described in theRegulation Act, Virginia Power may be required to share a portion of its earnings with customers through a refund process, and the Virginia Commission may order a base rate increase or reduction during the biennial review. Additionally, VirginiaPower was required to discontinue deferral accounting for certain existing rate adjustment clauses as of December 1, 2011. As a result, Virginia Power may potentially not fully recover costsassociated with these existing rate adjustment clauses.  Virginia Powers retail electric base rates for bundledgeneration, transmission, and distribution services to customers in North Carolina are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to North Carolina statutes, and the rules and procedures of the North Carolina Commission. If retailelectric earnings exceed the returns established by the North Carolina Commission, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the North Carolina Commission, which may decrease Virginia Powers future earnings.Additionally, if the North Carolina Commission does not allow recovery through base rates, on a timely basis, of costs incurred in providing service, Virginia Powers future earnings could be negatively impacted. Dominion and Virginia Power are subject to complex governmental regulation that couldadversely affect their results of operations and subject the Companies to monetary penalties. Dominions and VirginiaPowers operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation and require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies. These operations are also subject to legislation governing taxation atthe federal, state and local level. They must also comply with environmental legislation and associated regulations. Management believes that the necessary approvals have been obtained for existing operations and that the business is conducted inaccordance with applicable laws. The Companies businesses are subject to regulatory regimes which could result in substantial monetary penalties if either Dominion or Virginia Power is found not to be in compliance, including mandatoryreliability standards and interaction in the wholesale markets. New laws or regulations, the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations, or penalties imposed for non-compliance with existing laws or regulations may result insubstantial expense.  Dominions and Virginia Powers generationbusiness may be negatively affected by possible FERC actions that could change market design in the wholesale markets or affect pricing rules or revenue calculations in the RTOmarkets. Dominions and Virginia Powers generation stations operating in RTO markets sell capacity, energy andancillary services into wholesale electricity markets regulated by FERC. The wholesale markets allow these generation stations to take advantage of market price opportunities, but also expose them to market risk. Properly functioning competitivewholesale markets depend upon FERCs continuation of clearly identified market rules. From time to time FERC may investigate and authorize RTOs to make changes in market design. FERC also periodically reviews Dominions authority to sellat market-based rates. Material changes by FERC to the design of the wholesale markets, Dominions or Virginia Powers authority to sell power at market-based rates, or changes to pricing rules or rules involving revenue calculations,could adversely impact the future results of Dominions or Virginia Powers generation business.  Dominion and Virginia Power infrastructure build plans often require regulatory approval before construction cancommence. Dominion and Virginia Power may not complete plant construction or expansion projects that they commence, or they may complete projects on materially different terms or timing than initially anticipated, and they may not be able to achievethe intended benefits of any such project, if completed. Several plant construction and expansion projects have been announced and additional projects may be considered in the  20     Table of Contents   future. Commencing construction on announced plants requires approvals from applicable state and federal agencies. Projects may not be able to be completed on time as a result of weatherconditions, delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory approvals, delays in obtaining key materials, labor difficulties, difficulties with partners or potential partners, a decline in the credit strength of their counterparties or vendors,or other factors beyond their control. Even if plant construction and expansion projects are completed, the total costs of the projects may be higher than anticipated and the performance of the business of Dominion and Virginia Power following theprojects may not meet expectations. Additionally, Dominion and Virginia Power may not be able to timely and effectively integrate the projects into their operations and such integration may result in unforeseen operating difficulties orunanticipated costs. Further, regulators may disallow recovery of some of the costs of a project if they are deemed not to be prudently incurred. Any of these or other factors could adversely affect the Companies ability to realize theanticipated benefits from the plant construction and expansion projects. Dominions and Virginia Powers current costs of compliance with environmental lawsare significant. The costs of compliance with future environmental laws, including laws and regulations designed to address global climate change, air quality, coal combustion by-products, cooling water and other matters could make certain of theCompanies generation facilities uneconomical to maintain or operate. Dominions and Virginia Powers operationsare subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources, and health and safety. Compliance with these legal requirements requires theCompanies to commit significant capital toward permitting, emission fees, environmental monitoring, installation and operation of pollution control equipment and purchase of allowances and/or offsets. Additionally, the Companies could be responsiblefor expenses relating to remediation and containment obligations, including at sites where they have been identified by a regulatory agency as a potentially responsible party. Expenditures relating to environmental compliance have been significantin the past, and Dominion and Virginia Power expect that they will remain significant in the future.  Existingenvironmental laws and regulations may be revised and/or new laws may be adopted or become applicable to Dominion or Virginia Power. The EPA is expected to issue additional regulations with respect to air quality under the CAA, including revisedNAAQS and regulations governing the emissions of GHGs from electric generating units. Risks relating to potential regulation of GHG emissions are discussed below. Dominion and Virginia Power also expect additional federal water and wasteregulations, including regulations concerning cooling water intake structures and coal combustion by-product handling and disposal practices that are expected to be applicable to at least some of its generating facilities. Compliance costs cannot be estimated with certainty due to the inability to predict the requirements and timing of implementation of anynew environmental rules or regulations. Other factors which affect the ability to predict future environmental expenditures with certainty include the difficulty in estimating clean-up costs and quantifying liabilities under environmental laws thatimpose joint and several liability on all responsible parties. However, such expenditures, if material, could make the Companies facilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affectDominions or Virginia Powers results of operations, financial performance or liquidity.If additional federal and/or state requirementsare imposed on energy companies mandating limitations on GHG emissions or requiring efficiency improvements, such requirements may result in compliance costs that alone or in combination could make some of Dominions or Virginia Powers electric generation units or natural gas facilities uneconomicalto maintain or operate. The EPA, environmental advocacy groups, other organizations and some state and other federal agencies arefocusing considerable attention on GHG emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. Dominion and Virginia Power expect that additional EPA regulations, and possibly additional state legislation and/orregulations, may be issued resulting in the imposition of additional limitations on GHG emissions or requiring efficiency improvements from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. There are also potential impacts on Dominions natural gas businesses as federal or state GHG legislation orregulations may require GHG emission reductions from the natural gas sector and could affect demand for natural gas. Additionally, GHG requirements could result in increased demand for energy conservation and renewable products. Several regions ofthe U.S. have moved forward with GHG emission regulations including regions where Dominion has operations. For example, Massachusetts and Rhode Island have implemented regulations requiring reductions in CO2 emissions through RGGI, a cap and trade program covering CO2 emissions from power plants in the Northeast, which affects several ofDominions facilities.  Compliance with GHG emission reduction requirements may require increasing the energy efficiencyof equipment at facilities, committing significant capital toward carbon capture and storage technology, purchase of allowances and/or offsets, fuel switching, and/or retirement of high-emitting generation facilities and potential replacement withlower emitting generation facilities. The cost of compliance with GHG emission legislation and/or regulation is subject to significant uncertainties due to the outcome of several interrelated assumptions and variables, including timing of theimplementation of rules, required levels of reductions, allocation requirements of the new rules, the maturation and commercialization of carbon capture and storage technology, and the selected compliance alternatives. The Companies cannot estimatethe aggregate effect of such requirements on their results of operations, financial condition or their customers. However, such expenditures, if material, could make the Companies generation facilities uneconomical to operate, result in theimpairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect Dominions or Virginia Powers results of operations, financial performance or liquidity.  Risks arising from the reliability of the Companies facilities supply chain disruptions or personnel issues could result in lost revenuesand increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs. Operation ofthe Companies facilities involves risk, including the risk of potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure, fuel supply or transportation disruptions, accidents, labor disputes or work stoppages byemployees, acts of terrorism or sabotage, construction delays or cost overruns, shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material and labor, operational restrictions resulting from environmental limitations and governmental interventions, andperformance below expected levels. In addition, weather-related incidents, earthquakes and other natural disasters can disrupt operation of the Companies facilities. Because Virginia Powers transmission facilities are interconnected withthose of third parties, the operation of its facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties.  21  Table of Contents   Operation of the Companies facilities below expected capacity levels could result inlost revenues and increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs. Unplanned outages of the Companies facilities and extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems occur from time to time and are aninherent risk of the Companies business. Unplanned outages typically increase the Companies operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce their revenues as a result of selling less output or may require the Companies to incursignificant costs as a result of operating higher cost units or obtaining replacement output from third parties in the open market to satisfy forward energy and capacity or other contractual obligations. Moreover, if the Companies are unable toperform their contractual obligations, penalties or liability for damages could result.  Dominion and Virginia Power have substantial ownership interests in and operate nuclear generating units; as a result, each may incur substantial costs and liabilities.Dominions and Virginia Powers nuclear facilities are subject to operational, environmental, health and financial risks such as the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel, theability to dispose of such spent nuclear fuel, the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance available, potential operational liabilities and extended outages, the costs ofreplacement power, the costs of maintenance and the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks. Dominion and Virginia Power maintain decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage to minimize the financial exposureto these risks; however, it is possible that future decommissioning costs could exceed amounts in the decommissioning trusts and/or damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. If Dominions and Virginia Powers decommissioningtrust funds are insufficient, and they are not allowed to recover the additional costs incurred through insurance, or in the case of Virginia Power through regulatory mechanisms, their results of operations could be negatively impacted. Dominions and Virginia Powers nuclear facilities are also subject to complex government regulationwhich could negatively impact their results of operations. The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generating facilities. In the event of noncompliance, the NRChas the authority to impose fines, set license conditions, shut down a nuclear unit, or take some combination of these actions, depending on its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirementspromulgated by the NRC could require Dominion and Virginia Power to make substantial expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, although the Companies have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at their plants, if an incidentdid occur, it could materially and adversely affect their results of operations and/or financial condition. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world, such as the nuclear events in Japan in 2011, could cause the NRC to adoptincreased safety regulations or otherwise limit or restrict the operation or licensing of domestic nuclear units.  Dominion depends on third parties to produce the natural gas it gathers and processes, and the NGLs it fractionates at its facilities. A reduction in these quantities could reduce Dominionsrevenues. Dominion obtains its supply of natural gas and NGLs from numerous third-party producers. Such producers are under no obligation to deliver a specific quantity of natural gas orNGLs to Dominions facilities, although the producers that havecon-tracted to supply natural gas to Dominions natural gas processing and fractionation facility under development in Natrium, West Virginia will generally be subject to contractual minimum feepayments. If producers were to decrease the supply of natural gas or NGLs to Dominions systems and facilities for any reason, Dominion could experience lower revenues to the extent it is unable to replace the lost volumes on similar terms. Dominions merchant power business is operating in a challengingmarket, which could adversely affect its results of operations and future growth. The success of Dominions merchant power business depends upon favorable market conditions includingthe ability to sell power at prices sufficient to cover its operating costs. Dominion operates in active wholesale markets that expose it to price volatility for electricity and fuel as well as the credit risk of counterparties. Dominion attempts tomanage its price risk by entering into hedging transactions, including short-term and long-term fixed price sales and purchase contracts.  In these wholesale markets, the spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the cost of supplying the next unit of electricity to the market during that hour. In many cases,the next unit of electricity supplied would be provided by generating stations that consume fossil fuels, primarily natural gas. Consequently, the open market wholesale price for electricity generally reflects the cost of natural gas plus the costto convert the fuel to electricity. Therefore, changes in the price of natural gas generally affect the open market wholesale price of electricity. To the extent Dominion does not enter into long-term power purchase agreements or otherwiseeffectively hedge its output, these changes in market prices could adversely affect its financial results.  Dominion purchasesfuel under a variety of terms, including long-term and short-term contracts and spot market purchases. Dominion is exposed to fuel cost volatility for the portion of its fuel obtained through short-term contracts or on the spot market, including asa result of market supply shortages. Fuel prices can be volatile and the price that can be obtained for power produced from such fuel may not change at the same rate as fuel costs, thus adversely impacting Dominions financial results. Energy conservation could negatively impact Dominions and VirginiaPowers financial results. Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by a fixed date.Additionally, technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in end-use electric devices, including lighting and electric heat pumps, could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption. To the extentconservation results in reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand, the value of the Companies business activities could be adversely impacted.  Exposure to counterparty performance may adversely affect the Companies financial results of operations. Dominion and Virginia Power are exposed to credit risks of their counterparties and the risk that one or more counterparties may fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations, includingbut not limited to payment for services. Counterparties could fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations for a number of reasons, including the effect of regulations on their operations. Such defaults by customers, suppliers orother third parties may adversely affect the Companies financial results.   22     Table of Contents   Market performance and other changes maydecrease the value of decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets or increase Dominions liabilities, which could then require significant additional funding. The performanceof the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trusts to satisfy future obligations to decommission Dominions nuclear plants and under its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Dominion has significantobligations in these areas and holds significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below expected return rates. With respect to decommissioning trust funds, a decline in the market value of these assets may increase the funding requirements of theobligations to decommission Dominions nuclear plants or require additional NRC-approved funding assurance.  A decline inthe market value of the assets held in trusts to satisfy future obligations under Dominions pension and other postretirement benefit plans may increase the funding requirements under such plans. Additionally, changes in interest rates affectthe liabilities under Dominions pension and other postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers ofretirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. If the decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets are negatively impacted by market fluctuations or other factors,Dominions results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows could be negatively affected.  The use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses and liquidity constraints.Dominion and Virginia Power use derivative instruments, including futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs, to manage commodity and financial market risks. In addition, Dominionpurchases and sells commodity-based contracts primarily in the natural gas market for trading purposes. The Companies could recognize financial losses on these contracts, including as a result of volatility in the market values of the underlyingcommodities, if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract or upon the failure or insolvency of a financial intermediary, exchange or clearinghouse used to enter, execute or clear these transactions. In the absence of actively-quoted marketprices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these contracts involves managements judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the under-lying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affectthe reported fair value of these contracts.  The use of derivatives to hedge future sales may limit the benefit Dominionwould otherwise receive from increases in commodity prices. These hedge arrangements generally include collateral requirements that require Dominion to deposit funds or post letters of credit with counterparties, financial intermediaries orclearinghouses to cover the fair value of covered contracts in excess of agreed upon credit limits. For instance, when commodity prices rise to levels substantially higher than the levels where it has hedged future sales, Dominion may be required touse a material portion of its available liquidity or obtain additional liquidity to cover these collateral requirements. In some circumstances, this could have a compounding effect on Dominions financial liquidity and results of operations. Inaddition, the availability or security of the collateral delivered by Dominionmay be adversely affected by the failure or insolvency of a financial intermediary, exchange or clearinghouse used to enter, execute or clear these types of transactions. Derivatives designated under hedge accounting, to the extent not fully offset by the hedged transaction, can result in ineffectivenesslosses. These losses primarily result from differences between the location and/or specifications of the derivative hedging instrument and the hedged item and could adversely affect Dominions results of operations. Dominions and Virginia Powers operations in regards to these transactions are subject to multiple market risks includingmarket liquidity, price volatility, credit strength of the Companies counterparties and the financial condition of the financial intermediaries, exchanges and clearinghouses used for the types of transactions. These market risks are beyond theCompanies control and could adversely affect their results of operations, liquidity and future growth.  The Dodd-FrankAct was enacted into law in July 2010 in an effort to improve regulation of financial markets. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions that will require certain over-the-counter derivatives, or swaps, to be centrally cleared and executed through anexchange or other approved trading platform. Non-financial entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end users, can choose to exempt their hedging transactions from these clearing and exchange tradingrequirements. Final rules for the over-the-counter derivative-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will continue to be established through the ongoing rulemaking process of the applicable regulators. If, as a result of the rulemaking process,Dominions or Virginia Powers derivative activities are not exempted from the clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, the Companies could be subject to higher costs, including from higher margin requirements, for theirderivative activities. In addition, implementation of, and compliance with, the over-the-counter derivative provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act by the Companies swap counterparties could result in increased costs related to the Companiesderivative activities.  Changing rating agency requirements could negativelyaffect Dominions and Virginia Powers growth and business strategy. In order to maintain appropriate credit ratings to obtain needed credit at a reasonable cost in light ofexisting or future rating agency requirements, Dominion and Virginia Power may find it necessary to take steps or change their business plans in ways that may adversely affect their growth and earnings. A reduction in Dominions credit ratingsor the credit ratings of Virginia Power could result in an increase in borrowing costs, loss of access to certain markets, or both, thus adversely affecting operating results and could require Dominion to post additional collateral in connectionwith some of its price risk management activities.  An inability to accessfinancial markets could adversely affect the execution of Dominions and Virginia Powers business plans. Dominion andVirginia Power rely on access to short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as significant sources of funding and liquidity for capital expenditures, normal working capital and collateral requirements related to hedges of future salesand purchases of energy-related commodities. Deterioration in the Companies creditworthiness, as evaluated by credit rating agencies or otherwise, or declines in market reputation either for the Companies or their industry in general, orgeneral financial market disruptions outside of Dominions and Virginia Powers control could increase their cost of borrowing or restrict their  23  Table of Contents   ability to access one or more financial markets. Further market disruptions could stem from delays in the current economic recovery, the bankruptcy of an unrelated company, general marketdisruption due to general credit market or political events, or the failure of financial institutions on which the Companies rely. Increased costs and restrictions on the Companies ability to access financial markets may be severe enough toaffect their ability to execute their business plans as scheduled. Potential changes in accounting practices may adversely affect Dominions andVirginia Powers financial results. Dominion and Virginia Power cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on public companies ingeneral, the energy industry or their operations specifically. New accounting standards could be issued that could change the way they record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. These changes in accounting standards could adversely affectearnings or could increase liabilities.  War, acts and threats of terrorism,natural disaster and other significant events could adversely affect Dominions and Virginia Powers operations.Dominion and Virginia Power cannot predict the impact that any future terrorist attacks may have on the energy industry in general, or on the Companies business in particular. Any retaliatory military strikes or sustained military campaign mayaffect the Companies operations in unpredictable ways, such as changes in insurance markets and disruptions of fuel supplies and markets. In addition, the Companies infrastructure facilities could be direct targets of, or indirectcasualties of, an act of terror. Furthermore, the physical compromise of the Companies facilities could adversely affect the Companies ability to manage these facilities effectively. Instability in financial markets as a result ofterrorism, war, natural disasters, pandemic, credit crises, recession or other factors could result in a significant decline in the U.S. economy and increase the cost of insurance coverage. This could negatively impact the Companies results ofoperations and financial condition.  Hostile cyber intrusions could severelyimpair Dominions and Virginia Powers operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information, damage the reputation of the Companies and otherwise have an adverse effect on Dominions and Virginia Powersbusiness. The Companies own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on informationtechnology systems. Further, the computer systems that run the Companies facilities are not completely isolated from external networks. Parties that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system or the Companies operations could view theCompanies computer systems, software or networks as attractive targets for cyber attack. In addition, the Companies businesses require that they collect and maintain sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee andshareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss.  A successful cyber attack on the systems thatcontrol the Companies electric generation, electric or gas transmission or distribution assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing the Companies from serving customers or collecting revenues. The breach of certain businesssystems could affect the Companies ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could leadto litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to the Companies reputation. In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and otherconfidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring. The Companies maintain property and casualty insurance that may covercertain damage caused by potential cybersecurity incidents, however, other damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available. For these reasons, a significant cyber incident couldmaterially and adversely affect the Companies business, financial condition and results of operations.  Failure to retain and attract key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on Dominions and Virginia Powers operations. Dominions and Virginia Powers business strategy is dependent on their ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees. Competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and theinability to retain and attract these employees could adversely affect their business and future operating results. An aging workforce in the energy industry necessitates recruiting, retaining and developing the next generation of leadership.    "
2,D,DOMINION ENERGY INC,2012-02-28,">Item 1A. RiskFactors  Dominions and Virginia Powers businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involveuncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyond their control. A number of these factors have been identified below. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in anyforward-looking statement or projection contained in this report, see Forward-Looking Statements in Item 7. MD&A.  Dominions and Virginia Powers results of operations can be affected by changes in the weather. Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas, and affect the price of energy commodities. In addition, severe weather, including hurricanes and winter storms, can bedestructive, causing outages and property damage that require incurring additional expenses. Droughts can result in reduced water levels that could adversely affect operations at some of the Companies power stations. Furthermore, theCompanies operations could be adverselyaffected and their physical plant placed at greater risk of damage should changes in global climate produce, among other possible conditions, unusual variations in temperature and weatherpatterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, abnormal levels of precipitation and, for operations located on or near coastlines, a change in sea level. Dominion and Virginia Power are subject to complex governmental regulation that couldadversely affect their results of operations. Dominions and Virginia Powers operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation and require numerouspermits, approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies. These operations are also subject to legislation governing taxation at the federal, state and local level. They must also comply with environmental legislation and associatedregulations. Management believes that the necessary approvals have been obtained for existing operations and that the business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws. However, new laws or regulations, the revision or reinterpretation ofexisting laws or regulations, or penalties imposed for non-compliance with existing laws or regulations may result in substantial expense.  Dominion and Virginia Power could be subject to penalties as a result of mandatory reliability standards. As a result of EPACT, owners and operators of generation facilities and bulk electric transmission systems, including Dominion and Virginia Power, are subject to mandatory reliability standards enactedby NERC and enforced by FERC. Compliance with the mandatory reliability standards may subject the Companies to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures. If either Dominion or Virginia Power is found not to be incompliance with the mandatory reliability standards it could be subject to remediation costs, as well as sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties.  Dominions and Virginia Powers costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant. The costs of compliance with future environmentallaws, including laws and regulations designed to address global climate change, air quality, coal combustion by-products, cooling water and other matters could make certain of the Companies generation facilities uneconomical to maintain oroperate. Dominions and Virginia Powers operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality,water quality, waste management, natural resources, and health and safety. Compliance with these legal requirements requires the Companies to commit significant capital toward permitting, emission fees, environmental monitoring, installation andoperation of pollution control equipment and purchase of allowances and/or offsets. Additionally, the Companies could be responsible for expenses relating to remediation and containment obligations, including at sites where they have been identifiedby a regulatory agency as a potentially responsible party. Expenditures relating to environmental compliance have been significant in the past, and Dominion and Virginia Power expect that they will remain significant in the future. Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and/or new laws may be adopted or become applicable to Dominion or VirginiaPower. The EPA is expected to issue additional regulations with respect to air quality under the CAA, including revised NAAQS and regulations governing the emissions of GHGs from electric generating units. Risks relating to potential regulation ofGHG emissions are discussed below. Dominion and   20     Table of Contents   Virginia Power also expect additional federal water and waste regulations, including regulations concerning cooling water intake structures and coal combustion by-product handling and disposalpractices that are expected to be applicable to at least some of its generating facilities.  Compliance costs cannot beestimated with certainty due to the inability to predict the requirements and timing of implementation of any new environmental rules or regulations. Other factors which affect the ability to predict future environmental expenditures with certaintyinclude the difficulty in estimating clean-up costs and quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all responsible parties. However, such expenditures, if material, could make the Companiesgeneration facilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect Dominions or Virginia Powers results of operations, financial performance or liquidity. If additional federal and/or state requirements are imposed on energy companiesmandating limitations on GHG emissions or requiring efficiency improvements, such requirements may result in compliance costs that alone or in combination could make some of Dominions or Virginia Powers electric generation units ornatural gas facilities uneconomical to maintain or operate. The EPA, environmental advocacy groups, other organizations and some state and other federal agencies are focusing considerableattention on GHG emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. Dominion and Virginia Power expect that additional EPA regulations, and possibly additional state legislation and/or regulations, may be issuedresulting in the imposition of additional limitations on GHG emissions or requiring efficiency improvements from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. There are also potential impacts on Dominions natural gas businesses as federal or state GHG legislation orregulations may require GHG emission reductions from the natural gas sector and could affect demand for natural gas. Additionally, GHG requirements could result in increased demand for energy conservation and renewable products. Several regions ofthe U.S. have moved forward with GHG emission regulations including regions where Dominion has operations. For example, Massachusetts and Rhode Island have implemented regulations requiring reductions in CO2 emissions through RGGI, a cap and trade program covering CO2 emissions from power plants in the Northeast, which affects several ofDominions facilities.  Compliance with GHG emission reduction requirements may require increasing the energy efficiencyof equipment at facilities, committing significant capital toward carbon capture and storage technology, purchase of allowances and/or offsets, fuel switching, and/or retirement of high-emitting generation facilities and potential replacement withlower emitting generation facilities. The cost of compliance with GHG emission legislation and/or regulation is subject to significant uncertainties due to the outcome of several interrelated assumptions and variables, including timing of theimplementation of rules, required levels of reductions, allocation requirements of the new rules, the maturation and commercialization of carbon capture and storage technology, and the selected compliance alternatives. The Companies cannot estimatethe aggregate effect of such requirements on their results of operations, financial condition or their customers. However,such expenditures, if material, could make the Companies generation facilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect Dominions orVirginia Powers results of operations, financial performance or liquidity. The rates of Virginia Power are subject to regulatory review. In the Biennial Review Order, the Virginia Commission determined that Virginia Powers actual ROE during the 2009 and 2010 combined test years exceeded the upper end of the authorized ROE earningsband for that period, resulting in an order that Virginia Power refund approximately $78 million to its customers. The Virginia Commission also determined that Virginia Powers new authorized ROE is 10.9%, inclusive of a performance incentiveof 50 basis points for meeting certain renewable energy targets. Subject to the outcome of the petition for rehearing or reconsideration described below, this ROE will serve as the ROE against which Virginia Powers earned return will becompared for all or part of the test periods in the 2013 biennial review proceeding. In December 2011, Virginia Power filed a petition with the Virginia Commission seeking a rehearing or reconsideration of the Biennial Review Order to clarifywhether the effective date of the newly authorized ROE is the date the Virginia Commission issued the 2011 Biennial Review Order or January 1, 2011. If the Virginia Commission orders that the effective date of the newly authorized ROE is January 1,2011, such effective date may adversely affect the outcome of the earnings test in the 2013 biennial review. In addition, Virginia Powers base rates are subject to reduction if the Virginia Commission concludes, in the 2013 biennial review,that Virginia Powers actual ROE during the test period exceeded the upper end of the authorized ROE earnings band for that period, under circumstances described in the Regulation Act. The Virginia Commission could also order Virginia Power torefund to customers 60% of any such excess earnings for the 2011-2012 earnings test period. The Virginia Commission may alternatively order Virginia Power to refund up to 100% of earnings that exceed the earnings band in a biennial review if itfinds that Virginia Powers total aggregate regulated rates have exceeded annual increases in the U.S. Consumer Price Index, as described in the Regulation Act.  In the 2011 Biennial Review Order, as a result of the Virginia Commissions determination that credits will be applied to customers bills, the Virginia Commission, as required by the RegulationAct, directed Virginia Power to combine its existing Riders T, C1, and C2 with Virginia Powers base costs, revenues and investments, and to file revised tariffs reflecting such combination. These existing Riders will thereafter be consideredpart of Virginia Powers base costs, revenues and investments for purposes of future biennial review proceedings. The Virginia Commission has initiated a proceeding to address how this combination will be implemented. Depending on how theVirginia Commission orders the combination of existing Riders T, C1 and C2 to be effected, Virginia Power may be required to discontinue deferral accounting and could potentially not receive full recovery of costs associated with these existingriders. At this time, Virginia Power is not able to estimate the impact, if any, of the outcome of these proceedings.  The rates of Virginia Powers electric transmission operations and Dominions gas transmission and distribution operations are subject to regulatory review. Revenue provided by Virginia Powers electric  21  Table of Contents   transmission operations and Dominions gas transmission and distribution operations is based primarily on rates approved by federal and state regulatory agencies. The profitability of thesebusinesses is dependent on their ability, through the rates that they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on their capital investment. Virginia Powers wholesale charges for electric transmission service are adjusted on an annual basis through operation of aFERC-approved formula rate mechanism. Through this mechanism, Virginia Powers wholesale electric transmission cost of service is estimated and thereafter adjusted as appropriate to reflect actual costs allocated to Virginia Power by PJM. Thesewholesale rates are subject to FERC review and prospective adjustment in the event that customers and/or interested state commissions file a complaint with FERC and are able to demonstrate that Virginia Powers wholesale revenue requirement isno longer just and reasonable.  Similarly, various rates and charges assessed by Dominions gas transmission businessesare subject to review by FERC. In addition, Dominions gas distribution businesses are subject to state regulatory review in the jurisdictions in which they operate.  Risks arising from the reliability of electric generation, transmission and distribution equipment, supply chain disruptions or personnel issues couldresult in lost revenues and increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs. Operation of the Companies generation, transmission and distribution facilities involves risk,including the risk of potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure, fuel supply or transportation disruptions, accidents, labor disputes or work stoppages by employees, acts of terrorism or sabotage,construction delays or cost overruns, shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material and labor, operational restrictions resulting from environmental limitations and governmental interventions, and performance below expected levels. Inaddition, weather-related incidents, earthquakes and other natural disasters can disrupt generation, transmission and distribution facilities. Because Virginia Powers transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties, theoperation of its facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties.  Operation of the Companies generation facilities below expected capacity levels could result in lost revenues and increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs. Unplanned outages ofgenerating units and extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of the Companies business. Unplanned outages typically increase the Companies operationand maintenance expenses and may reduce their revenues as a result of selling less energy or may require the Companies to incur significant costs as a result of operating higher cost units or obtaining replacement energy and capacity from thirdparties in the open market to satisfy forward energy and capacity obligations. Moreover, if the Companies are unable to perform their contractual obligations, penalties or liability for damages could result. Dominions merchant power business is operating in a challenging market, whichcould adversely affect its results of operations and future growth. The success of Dominions merchant power business depends upon favorable market conditions including the abilityto purchase and sell power at prices sufficient to cover its operating costs. Dominion operates in active wholesale markets that expose it to price volatility for electricity and fuel as well as thecredit risk of counterparties. Dominion attempts to manage its price risk by entering into hedging transactions, including short-term and long-term fixed price sales and purchase contracts. In these wholesale markets, the spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the cost of supplying the nextunit of electricity to the market during that hour. In many cases, the next unit of electricity supplied would be provided by generating stations that consume fossil fuels, primarily natural gas. Consequently, the open market wholesale price forelectricity generally reflects the cost of natural gas plus the cost to convert the fuel to electricity. Therefore, changes in the price of natural gas generally affect the open market wholesale price of electricity. To the extent Dominion does notenter into long-term power purchase agreements or otherwise effectively hedge its output, these changes in market prices could adversely affect its financial results.  Dominion purchases fuel under a variety of terms, including long-term and short-term contracts and spot market purchases. Dominion is exposed to fuel cost volatility for the portion of its fuel obtainedthrough short-term contracts or on the spot market. Fuel prices can be volatile and the price that can be obtained for power produced from such fuel may not change at the same rate as fuel costs, thus adversely impacting Dominions financialresults.  Dominions and Virginia Powers generation business maybe negatively affected by possible FERC actions that could change market design in the wholesale markets or affect pricing rules orrevenue calculations in the RTO markets. Dominions and Virginia Powers generation stations operating in RTO markets sell capacity, energy and ancillary services into wholesaleelectricity markets regulated by FERC. The wholesale markets allow these generation stations to take advantage of market price opportunities, but also expose them to market risk. Properly functioning competitive wholesale markets in PJM, MISO andISO-NE depend upon FERCs continuation of clearly identified market rules. From time to time FERC may investigate and authorize PJM, MISO and ISO-NE to make changes in market design. FERC also periodically reviews Dominions authority tosell at market-based rates. Material changes by FERC to the design of the wholesale markets, Dominions or Virginia Powers authority to sell power at market-based rates, or changes to pricing rules or rules involving revenue calculations,could adversely impact the future results of Dominions or Virginia Powers generation business.  War, acts and threats of terrorism, natural disaster and other significant events could adversely affect Dominions and Virginia Powers operations. Dominion and Virginia Power cannot predict the impact that any future terrorist attacks may have on the energy industry in general, or on the Companies business in particular. Any retaliatorymilitary strikes or sustained military campaign may affect the Companies operations in unpredictable ways, such as changes in insurance markets and disruptions of fuel supplies and markets. In addition, infrastructure facilities, such aselectric generation, electric and gas transmission and distribution facilities could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror. Furthermore, the physical or cybersecurity compromise of the Companies facilities couldadversely affect the Companies ability to manage these facilities effectively. Instability in financialmar-  22     Table of Contents   kets as a result of terrorism, war, natural disasters, pandemic, credit crises, recession or other factors could result in a significant decline in the U.S. economy and increase the cost ofinsurance coverage. This could negatively impact the Companies results of operations and financial condition.  Dominion and Virginia Power have substantial ownership interests in and operate nuclear generating units; as a result, each may incur substantial costs and liabilities. Dominions and Virginia Powers nuclear facilities are subject to operational, environmental, health and financial risks such as the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel, the ability todispose of such spent nuclear fuel, the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance available, potential operational liabilities and extended outages, the costs of replacement power,the costs of maintenance and the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks. Dominion and Virginia Power maintain decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage to minimize the financial exposure to these risks;however, it is possible that future decommissioning costs could exceed amounts in the decommissioning trusts and/or damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. If Dominion and Virginia Power are not allowed to recover the additional costsincurred through insurance, or in the case of Virginia Power through regulatory mechanisms, their results of operations could be negatively impacted.  Dominions and Virginia Powers nuclear facilities are also subject to complex government regulation which could negatively impact their results of operations. The NRC has broad authority underfederal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generating facilities. In the event of noncompliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines, set license conditions, shut down a nuclear unit, or takesome combination of these actions, depending on its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require Dominion and Virginia Power to make substantialexpenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, although the Companies have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at their plants, if an incident did occur, it could materially and adversely affect their results of operations and/orfinancial condition. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world, such as the nuclear events in Japan in 2011, could cause the NRC to adopt increased safety regulations or otherwise limit or restrict the operation or licensing ofdomestic nuclear units.  The use of derivative instruments could result infinancial losses and liquidity constraints. Dominion and Virginia Power use derivative instruments, including futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs, to manage commodity and financialmarket risks. In addition, Dominion purchases and sells commodity-based contracts primarily in the natural gas market for trading purposes. The Companies could recognize financial losses on these contracts, including as a result of volatility in themarket values of the underlying commodities, if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract or upon the failure or insolvency of a financial intermediary, exchange or clearinghouse used to enter, execute or clear these transactions. In theabsence of actively-quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these contracts involves managements judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in theunder-lying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.  The use of derivatives to hedge future sales may limit the benefit Dominion would otherwise receive from increases in commodity prices. These hedge arrangements generally include collateral requirementsthat require Dominion to deposit funds or post letters of credit with counterparties, financial intermediaries or clearinghouses to cover the fair value of covered contracts in excess of agreed upon credit limits. For instance, when commodity pricesrise to levels substantially higher than the levels where it has hedged future sales, Dominion may be required to use a material portion of its available liquidity or obtain additional liquidity to cover these collateral requirements. In somecircumstances, this could have a compounding effect on Dominions financial liquidity and results of operations. In addition, the availability or security of the collateral delivered by Dominion may be adversely affected by the failure orinsolvency of a financial intermediary, exchange or clearinghouse used to enter, execute or clear these types of transactions. Derivatives designated under hedge accounting, to the extent not fully offset by the hedged transaction, can result in ineffectivenesslosses. These losses primarily result from differences between the location and/or specifications of the derivative hedging instrument and the hedged item and could adversely affect Dominions results of operations. Dominions and Virginia Powers operations in regards to these transactions are subject to multiple market risks includingmarket liquidity, price volatility, credit strength of the Companies counterparties and the financial condition of the financial intermediaries, exchanges and clearinghouses used for the types of transactions. These market risks are beyond theCompanies control and could adversely affect their results of operations, liquidity and future growth.  The Dodd-FrankAct, which was enacted into law in July 2010, includes provisions that will require certain over-the-counter derivatives, or swaps, to be centrally cleared and executed through an exchange or other approved trading platform. Final rules for theover-the-counter derivatives-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the clearing, exchange trading and capital and margin requirements, will be established through the on-going rulemaking process of each applicable regulator, includingthe CFTC and SEC. In June 2011, both the CFTC and SEC confirmed that they would not complete the required rulemakings by the July 2011 deadline under the Dodd-Frank Act. Each agency has granted temporary relief from most derivative-relatedprovisions of the Dodd-Frank Act until the effective date of the applicable rules. Currently, the CFTCs temporary relief would expire no later than July 16, 2012, if not extended. If, as a result of the rulemaking process, Dominions orVirginia Powers derivative activities are not exempted from the clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, the Companies could be subject to higher costs for their derivative activities, including from higher margin requirements. Inaddition, implementation of, and compliance with, the over-the-counter derivatives provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act by the Companies swap counterparties could result in increased costs related to the Companies derivative activities. Dominion depends on third parties to produce the natural gas it gathers andprocesses, and the NGLs it fractionates at its facilities. A reduction in these quantities could reduce Dominions revenues.  23  Table of Contents   Dominion obtains its supply of natural gas and NGLs from numerous third-party producers. Such producers are under no obligation to deliver a specific quantity of natural gas or NGLs toDominions facilities, although the producers that have contracted to supply natural gas to Dominions natural gas processing and fractionation facility under development in Natrium, West Virginia will generally be subject to contractualminimum fee payments. If producers were to decrease the supply of natural gas or NGLs to Dominions systems and facilities for any reason, Dominion could experience lower revenues to the extent it is unable to replace the lost volumes onsimilar terms.  Exposure to counterparty performance may adversely affectthe Companies financial results of operations. Dominion and Virginia Power are exposed to credit risks of their counterparties and the risk that one or more counterparties may failor delay the performance of their contractual obligations, including but not limited to payment for services. Counterparties could fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations for a number of reasons, including the effect ofregulations on their operations. Such defaults by customers, suppliers or other third parties may adversely affect the Companies financial results.  Dominion and Virginia Power may not complete plant construction or expansion projects that they commence, or they may complete projects on materiallydifferent terms or timing than initially anticipated and they may not be able to achieve the intended benefits of any such project, if completed. Several plant construction andexpansion projects have been announced and additional projects may be considered in the future. Projects may not be able to be completed on time as a result of weather conditions, delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory approvals, delaysin obtaining key materials, labor difficulties, difficulties with partners or potential partners, a decline in the credit strength of their counterparties or vendors, or other factors beyond their control. Even if plant construction and expansionprojects are completed, the total costs of the projects may be higher than anticipated and the performance of the business of Dominion and Virginia Power following the projects may not meet expectations. Additionally, Dominion and Virginia Power maynot be able to timely and effectively integrate the projects into their operations and such integration may result in unforeseen operating difficulties or unanticipated costs. Further, regulators may disallow recovery of some of the costs of aproject if they are deemed not to be prudently incurred. Any of these or other factors could adversely affect the Companies ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the plant construction and expansion projects. Energy conservation could negatively impact Dominions and Virginia Powersfinancial results. Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by a fixed date. Additionally,technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in end-use electric devices, including lighting and electric heat pumps, could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption. To the extent conservationresults in reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand, the value of the Companies business activities could be adversely impacted.  An inability to access financial markets could adversely affect the execution of Dominions and Virginia Powers business plans. Dominion and Virginia Power rely on access to short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as significant sources of funding and liquidity for capital expenditures, normal workingcapital and collateral requirements related to hedges of future sales and purchases of energy-related commodities. Deterioration in the Companies creditworthiness, as evaluated by creditrating agencies or otherwise, or declines in market reputation either for the Companies or their industry in general, or general financial market disruptions outside of Dominions and Virginia Powers control could increase their cost ofborrowing or restrict their ability to access one or more financial markets. Further market disruptions could stem from delays in the current economic recovery, the bankruptcy of an unrelated company, general market disruption due to general creditmarket or political events, or the failure of financial institutions on which the Companies rely. Increased costs and restrictions on the Companies ability to access financial markets may be severe enough to affect their ability to executetheir business plans as scheduled.  Market performance and other changes maydecrease the value of decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets or increase Dominions liabilities, which could then require significant additional funding. The performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trusts to satisfy future obligations to decommissionDominions nuclear plants and under its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Dominion has significant obligations in these areas and holds significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuation and willyield uncertain returns, which may fall below expected return rates.  With respect to decommissioning trust funds, a decline inthe market value of these assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations to decommission Dominions nuclear plants or require additional NRC-approved funding assurance. A decline in the market value of the assets held in trusts to satisfy future obligations under Dominions pension and otherpostretirement benefit plans may increase the funding requirements under such plans. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under Dominions pension and other postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, theliabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase the funding requirements of the obligationsrelated to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  If the decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets arenegatively impacted by market fluctuations or other factors, Dominions results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows could be negatively affected.  Changing rating agency requirements could negatively affect Dominions and Virginia Powers growth and business strategy. In order to maintain appropriate credit ratings to obtain needed credit at a reasonable cost in light of existing or future rating agency requirements, Dominion and Virginia Power may find it necessaryto take steps or change their business plans in ways that may adversely affect their growth and earnings. A reduction in Dominions credit ratings or the credit ratings of Virginia Power could result in an increase in borrowing costs, loss ofaccess to certain markets, or both, thus adversely affecting operating results and could require Dominion to post additional collateral in connection with some of its price risk management activities. Potential changes in accounting practices may adversely affect Dominions andVirginia Powers financial results. Dominion and Virginia Power cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on public companies  24     Table of Contents   in general, the energy industry or their operations specifically. New accounting standards could be issued that could change the way they record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Thesechanges in accounting standards could adversely affect reported earnings or could increase reported liabilities.  Failure to retain and attract key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on Dominions and Virginia Powers operations. Dominions and Virginia Powers business strategy is dependent on their ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees. Competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and theinability to retain and attract these employees could adversely affect their business and future operating results.  Hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair Dominions and Virginia Powers operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information, damage the reputation of the Companies and otherwise have an adverse effect on Dominions and Virginia Powers business. TheCompanies own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems. Further, the computer systems that run the Companies facilities are not completely isolated from external networks.Parties that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system or the Companies operations could view the Companies computer systems, software or networks as attractive targets for cyber attack. In addition, the Companies businessrequires that they collect and maintain sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss.  A successful cyber attack on the systems that control the Companies electric generation, electric or gas transmission or distribution assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventingthe Companies from serving customers or collecting revenues. The breach of certain business systems could affect the Companies ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. A major cyber incident could result insignificant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to the Companies reputation. In addition, themisappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring. The Companies maintain property andcasualty insurance that may cover certain damage caused by potential cybersecurity incidents, however, other damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available. For these reasons, asignificant cyber incident could materially and adversely affect the Companies business, financial condition and results of operations.  In an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber intrusions, the Companies have a comprehensive cybersecurity program designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity andavailability of data and systems. In addition, Dominion and Virginia Power are subject to mandatory cybersecurity regulatory requirements. However, cyber threats continue to evolve and adapt, and, as a result, there is a risk that the Companiescould experience a successful cyber attack despite their current security posture and regulatory compliance efforts.   "
16,D,DOMINION ENERGY INC,2011-02-28,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
  Dominions and Virginia Powers businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyondtheir control. A number of these factors have been identified below. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement or projection contained in this report, seeForward-Looking Statements in Item 7. MD&A.  Dominionsand Virginia Powers results of operations can be affected by changes in the weather. Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas, and affect  22     Table of Contents   the price of energy commodities. In addition, severe weather, including hurricanes and winter storms, can be destructive, causing outages and property damage that require incurring additionalexpenses. Additionally, droughts can result in reduced water levels that could adversely affect operations at some of the Companies power stations. Furthermore, the Companies operations could be adversely affected and their physicalplant placed at greater risk of damage should changes in global climate produce, among other possible conditions, unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, abnormal levelsof precipitation and, for operations located on or near coastlines, a change in sea level.  Dominion and Virginia Power are subject to complex governmental regulation that could adversely affect their results of operations. Dominionsand Virginia Powers operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation and require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies. They must also comply with environmental legislation andassociated regulations. Management believes that the necessary approvals have been obtained for existing operations and that their business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws. However, new laws or regulations, the revision orreinterpretation of existing laws or regulations, or penalties imposed for non-compliance with existing laws or regulations may result in substantial expense.  Dominion and Virginia Power could be subject to penalties as a result of mandatory reliability standards. As a result of EPACT, owners and operators of generation facilities and bulk electric transmission systems, including Dominion and Virginia Power, are subject to mandatory reliability standards enactedby NERC and enforced by FERC. Compliance with the mandatory reliability standards may subject the Companies to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures. If either Dominion or Virginia Power is found not to be incompliance with the mandatory reliability standards it could be subject to remediation costs, as well as sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties.  Dominions and Virginia Powers costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant. The costs of compliance with future environmental laws, including laws and regulations designed to address global climate change, air quality, coal combustion by-products, cooling water and other matters could make certain of the Companies generation facilities uneconomical to maintain or operate. Dominions and Virginia Powers operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, wastemanagement, natural resources, and health and safety. Compliance with these legal requirements requires the Companies to commit significant capital toward permitting, emission fees, environmental monitoring, installation and operation of pollutioncontrol equipment and purchase of allowances and/or offsets. Additionally, the Companies could be responsible for expenses relating to remediation and containment obligations, including at sites where they have been identified by a regulatory agencyas a potentially responsible party. Expenditures relating to environmental compliance have been significant in the past, and Dominion and Virginia Power expect that they will remain significant in the future. Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and/or new laws may be adopted or become applicable toDomin-ion or Virginia Power. The EPA is expected to issue additional regulations with respect to air quality under the CAA, including revised NAAQS, a replacement of the CAIR relating to NOX and SO2 emissions, and a MACT rule for coal and oil-fired electric generation plants that will likely address numerous HAPs,including mercury. Risks relating to potential regulation of GHG emissions are discussed below. Dominion and Virginia Power also expect additional federal water and waste regulations, including regulations concerning cooling water intake structuresand coal combustion by-product handling and disposal practices.  Compliance costs cannot be estimated with certainty due to theinability to predict the requirements and timing of implementation of any new environmental rules or regulations related to emissions. Other factors which affect the ability to predict future environmental expenditures with certainty include thedifficulty in estimating clean-up costs and quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all responsible parties. However, such expenditures, if excessive, could make the Companies generationfacilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect Dominions or Virginia Powers results of operations, financial performance or liquidity. If additional federal and/or state requirements are imposed on energy companiesmandating limitations on GHG emissions, such requirements may result in compliance costs that alone or in combination could make some of Dominions or Virginia Powers electric generation units uneconomical to maintain or operate. The U.S. Congress, environmental advocacy groups, other organizations and some state and federalagencies are focusing considerable attention on GHG emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. Dominion and Virginia Power expect that federal legislation and/or additional EPA regulation, and possiblyadditional state legislation and/or regulation, may pass resulting in the imposition of additional limitations on GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. There are also potential impacts on Dominions natural gas businesses as federal GHG legislation and regulationsmay require GHG emission reductions from the natural gas sector and could affect demand for natural gas. Additionally, GHG requirements could result in increased demand for energy conservation and renewable products. Several regions of the U.S. havemoved forward with GHG emission regulations including regions where Dominion has operations. For example, Massachusetts has implemented regulations requiring reductions in CO2 emissions through RGGI, a cap and trade program covering CO2 emissions from power plants in the Northeast, which affects several of Dominions facilities. Compliance with GHG emission reduction requirements may require increasing the energy efficiency of equipment at facilities, committingsignificant capital toward carbon capture and storage technology, purchase of allowances and/or offsets, fuel switching, and/or retirement of high-emitting generation facilities and potential replacement with lower emitting generation facilities.The cost of compliance with GHG emission legislation and/or regulation is subject to significant uncertainties due to the outcome of several interrelated assumptions and variables, including timing of the implementation of rules, required levels ofreductions, allocation requirements of the new rules, the maturation and commercialization of carbon capture and storage technology      23 Table of Contents   and associated regulations, and the selected compliance alternatives. As a result, the Companies cannot estimate the effect of any such legislation on their results of operations, financialcondition or their customers. However, such expenditures, if excessive, could make the Companies generation facilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect Dominions or VirginiaPowers results of operations, financial performance or liquidity.  Thebase rates and rider rates of Virginia Power are subject to regulatory review. As a result of the Regulation Act, in 2009 the Virginia Commission commenced its review of the base rates ofVirginia Power under a modified cost-of-service model. That review culminated in a final order in March 2010, in which the Commission ordered that Virginia Powers base rates be frozen at their pre-September 1, 2009 levels untilDecember 1, 2013. In 2011, however, the Virginia Commission will commence biennial reviews of the rates and terms and conditions of Virginia Power and, in that first biennial review, may order a credit to customers for a portion of earningsmore than 50 basis points above the authorized ROE.  The rates of VirginiaPowers electric transmission operations and Dominions gas transmission and distribution operations are subject to regulatory review. Revenue provided by Virginia Powerselectric transmission operations and Dominions gas transmission and distribution operations is based primarily on rates approved by federal and state regulatory agencies. The profitability of these businesses is dependent on their ability,through the rates that they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on their capital investment.  Virginia Powers wholesale charges for electric transmission service are adjusted on an annual basis through operation of a FERC-approved formula rate mechanism. Through this mechanism, VirginiaPowers wholesale electric transmission cost of service is estimated and thereafter adjusted as appropriate to reflect actual costs allocated to Virginia Power by PJM. These wholesale rates are subject to FERC review and prospective adjustmentin the event that customers and/or interested state commissions file a complaint with FERC and are able to demonstrate that Virginia Powers wholesale revenue requirement is no longer just and reasonable. Similarly, various rates and charges assessed by Dominions gas transmission businesses are subject to review by FERC. Dominion isrequired to file a general base rate review for the FERC-jurisdictional services of Cove Point, effective no later than July 31, 2011. At that time, Cove Points cost-of-service will be reviewed by the FERC, with rates set based onanalyses of Cove Points costs and capital structure.  Dominions gas distribution businesses are subject to stateregulatory review in the jurisdictions in which they operate.  Risks arising fromthe reliability of electric generation, transmission and distribution equipment could result in lost revenues and increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs. Operation of the Companies generation, transmission and distribution facilities involves risk, including, the risk of potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, due to aginginfrastructure, fuel supply or transportation disruptions, accidents, labor disputes or work stoppages by employees, acts of terrorism or sabotage, construction delays or cost overruns, shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material andlabor, operational restrictionsresulting from environmental limitations and governmental interventions, and performance below expected levels. In addition, weather-related incidents and other natural disasters can disruptgeneration, transmission and distribution facilities. Because Virginia Powers transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of its facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollableevents occurring on the systems of such third parties.  Operation of the Companies generation facilities below expectedcapacity levels could result in lost revenues and increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs. Unplanned outages of generating units and extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems occur from time to timeand are an inherent risk of the Companies business. Unplanned outages typically increase the Companies operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce their revenues as a result of selling less energy or may require the Companies toincur significant costs as a result of operating higher cost units or obtaining replacement energy and capacity from third parties in the open market to satisfy forward energy and capacity obligations. Moreover, if the Companies are unable toperform their contractual obligations, penalties or liability for damages could result.  Dominions merchant power business is operating in a challenging market, which could adversely affect its results of operations and futuregrowth.  The success of Dominions merchant power businessdepends upon favorable market conditions including the ability to purchase and sell power at prices sufficient to cover its operating costs. Dominion operates in active wholesale markets that expose it to price volatility for electricity and fuel aswell as the credit risk of counterparties. Dominion attempts to manage its price risk by entering into hedging transactions, including short-term and long-term fixed price sales and purchase contracts. In these wholesale markets, the spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the cost of supplying the nextunit of electricity to the market during that hour. In many cases, the next unit of electricity supplied would be provided by generating stations that consume fossil fuels, primarily natural gas. Consequently, the open market wholesale price forelectricity generally reflects the cost of natural gas plus the cost to convert the fuel to electricity. Therefore, changes in the price of natural gas generally affect the open market wholesale price of electricity. To the extent Dominion does notenter into long-term power purchase agreements or otherwise hedge its output, then these changes in market prices could adversely affect its financial results.  Dominion purchases fuel under a variety of terms, including long-term and short-term contracts and spot market purchases. Dominion is exposed to fuel cost volatility for the portion of its fuel obtainedthrough short-term contracts or on the spot market. Fuel prices can be volatile and the price that can be obtained for power produced from such fuel may not change at the same rate as fuel costs, thus adversely impacting Dominions financialresults.  Dominions merchant power business may be negatively affectedby possible FERC actions that could weaken competition in the wholesale markets or affect pricing rules in the RTO markets. Dominions merchant generation stations operating in PJM,MISO and ISO-NE sell capacity, energy and ancillary services into wholesaleelec-  24     Table of Contents   tricity markets regulated by FERC. The wholesale markets allow these merchant generation stations to take advantage of market price opportunities, but also expose them to market risk. Properlyfunctioning competitive wholesale markets in PJM, MISO and ISO-NE depend upon FERCs continuation of clearly identified market rules. From time to time FERC may investigate and authorize PJM, MISO and ISO-NE to make changes in market design.FERC also periodically reviews Dominions authority to sell at market-based rates. Material changes by FERC to the design of the wholesale markets or Dominions authority to sell power at market-based rates could adversely impact thefuture results of its merchant power business.  War, acts and threats ofterrorism, natural disaster and other significant events could adversely affect Dominions and Virginia Powers operations.We cannot predict the impact that any future terrorist attacks may have on the energy industry in general, or on our business in particular. Any retaliatory military strikes or sustainedmilitary campaign may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, such as changes in insurance markets and disruptions of fuel supplies and markets. In addition, infrastructure facilities, such as electric generation, electric and gas transmissionand distribution facilities could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror. Furthermore, the physical or cyber security compromise of our facilities, could adversely affect our ability to manage these facilities effectively.Instability in financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, natural disasters, pandemic, credit crises, recession or other factors could result in a significant decline in the U.S. economy, and the increased cost of insurance coverage, any ofwhich could negatively impact the Companies results of operations and financial condition.  There are risks associated with the operation of nuclear facilities. Dominion and Virginia Power operate nuclear facilities that are subject torisks, including their ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel, the disposal of which is subject to complex federal and state regulatory constraints. These risks also include the cost of and ability to maintain adequate reserves fordecommissioning, costs of replacement power, costs of plant maintenance and exposure to potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities. Decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage are maintained to mitigate thefinancial exposure to these risks. However, it is possible that decommissioning costs could exceed the amount in the trusts or that costs arising from claims could exceed the amount of any insurance coverage. The use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses and liquidityconstraints. Dominion and Virginia Power use derivative instruments, including futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs, to manage commodity and financial market risks. In addition,Dominion purchases and sells commodity-based contracts primarily in the natural gas market for trading purposes. The Companies could recognize financial losses on these contracts, including as a result of volatility in the market values of theunderlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract. In the absence of actively-quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these contracts involves managements judgment or useof estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.The use of derivatives to hedge future sales may limit the benefit Dominion would otherwisereceive from increases in commodity prices. These hedge arrangements generally include collateral requirements that require Dominion to deposit funds or post letters of credit with counterparties to cover the fair value of covered contracts inexcess of agreed upon credit limits. For instance, when commodity prices rise to levels substantially higher than the levels where it has hedged future sales, Dominion may be required to use a material portion of its available liquidity or obtainadditional liquidity to cover these collateral requirements. In some circumstances, this could have a compounding effect on Dominions financial liquidity and results of operations. Derivatives designated under hedge accounting, to the extent not fully offset by the hedged transaction, can result in ineffectivenesslosses. These losses primarily result from differences between the location and/or specifications of the derivative hedging instrument and the hedged item and could adversely affect Dominions results of operations. Dominions and Virginia Powers operations in regards to these transactions are subject to multiple market risks includingmarket liquidity, counterparty credit strength and price volatility. These market risks are beyond the Companies control and could adversely affect their results of operations and future growth. The Dodd-Frank Act, which was enacted into law in July 2010, includes provisions that will require certain over-the-counterderivatives, or swaps, to be centrally cleared and executed through an exchange or other approved trading platform. Final rules for the over-the-counter derivatives-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the clearing, exchange tradingand capital and margin requirements, will be established through the CFTCs rulemaking process, which is required to be completed by July 2011. If, as a result of the rulemaking process, Dominions or Virginia Powers derivativeactivities are not exempted from the clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, the Companies could be subject to higher costs for their derivative activities, including from higher margin requirements. In addition, implementation of, andcompliance with, the over-the-counter derivatives provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act by the Companies swap counterparties could result in increased costs related to the Companies derivative activities. Dominion and Virginia Power may not complete plant construction or expansion projectsthat they commence, or they may complete projects on materially different terms or timing than initially anticipated and they may not be able to achieve the intended benefits of any such project, if completed. Several plant construction and expansion projects have been announced and additional projects may be considered in the future. Management anticipates that they will be required to seek additionalfinancing in the future to fund current and future plant construction and expansion projects and may not be able to secure such financing on favorable terms. In addition, projects may not be able to be completed on time as a result of weatherconditions, delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory approvals, delays in obtaining key materials, labor difficulties, difficulties with partners or potential partners, a decline in the credit strength of their counterparties or vendors,or other factors beyond their control. Even if plant construction and expansion projects are completed, the total costs of the projects may be higher than anticipated and the performance of the business of Dominion and Virginia Power following theprojects may       25 Table of Contents   not meet expectations. Additionally, regulators may disallow recovery of some of the costs of a project if they are deemed not to be prudently incurred. Further, Dominion and Virginia Power maynot be able to timely and effectively integrate the projects into their operations and such integration may result in unforeseen operating difficulties or unanticipated costs. Any of these or other factors could adversely affect their ability torealize the anticipated benefits from the plant construction and expansion projects.  Exposure to counterparty performance may adversely affect the Companies financial results of operations. Dominion and Virginia Power are exposed to credit risks of their counterparties and the risk that one or more counterparties may fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations, includingbut not limited to payment for services. Such defaults by customers, suppliers or other third parties may adversely affect the Companies financial results.  Energy conservation could negatively impact Dominions and Virginia Powers financial results. Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by a fixed date. Additionally, technological advances driven byfederal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in end-use electric devices, including lighting and electric heat pumps, could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption. To the extent conservation resulted in reduced energy demand orsignificantly slowed the growth in demand, the value of the Companies business activities could be adversely impacted. An inability to access financial markets could adversely affect the execution ofDominions and Virginia Powers business plans. Dominion and Virginia Power rely on access to short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as significant sources offunding and liquidity for capital expenditures, normal working capital and collateral requirements related to hedges of future sales and purchases of energy-related commodities. Deterioration in the Companies creditworthiness, as evaluated bycredit rating agencies or otherwise, or market reputation, or general financial market disruptions outside of Dominions and Virginia Powers control could increase their cost of borrowing or restrict their ability to access one or morefinancial markets. Further market disruptions could stem from delays in the current economic recovery, the bankruptcy of an unrelated company, general market disruption due to general credit market or political events, or the failure of financialinstitutions on which the Companies rely. Increased costs and restrictions on the Companies ability to access financial markets may be severe enough to affect their ability to execute their business plans as scheduled. Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of decommissioning trustfunds and benefit plan assets or increase Dominions liabilities, which then could require significant additional funding. The performance of the capital markets affects the value ofthe assets that are held in trusts to satisfy future obligations to decommission Dominions nuclear plants and under its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Dominion has significant obligations in these areas and holds significantassets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below expected return rates. A decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligationsto decommission Dominionsnuclear plants and under its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under Dominions pension and other postretirementbenefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increasethe funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. If the decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets are negatively impacted by market fluctuations, Dominions results ofoperations and financial condition could be negatively affected.  Changingrating agency requirements could negatively affect Dominions and Virginia Powers growth and business strategy. In order to maintain appropriate credit ratings to obtain neededcredit at a reasonable cost in light of existing or future rating agency requirements, Dominion and Virginia Power may find it necessary to take steps or change their business plans in ways that may adversely affect their growth and earnings. Areduction in Dominions credit ratings or the credit ratings of Virginia Power could result in an increase in borrowing costs, loss of access to certain markets, or both, thus adversely affecting operating results and could require Dominion topost additional collateral in connection with some of its price risk management activities.  Potential changes in accounting practices may adversely affect Dominions and Virginia Powers financial results. Dominion and VirginiaPower cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on public companies in general, the energy industry or their operations specifically. New accounting standards could be issued that could change theway they record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. These changes in accounting standards could adversely affect reported earnings or could increase reported liabilities. Failure to retain and attract key executive officers and other skilled professional andtechnical employees could have an adverse effect on Dominions and Virginia Powers operations. Dominions and Virginia Powers business strategy is dependent on theirability to recruit, retain and motivate employees. Competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to retain and attract these employees could adversely affect their business and future operating results"
11,D,DOMINION ENERGY INC,2010-02-26,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
  Dominions and Virginia Powers businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyondtheir control. A number of these factors have been identified below. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement or projection contained in this report, seeForward-Looking Statements in Item 7. MD&A.  Dominionsand Virginia Powers results of operations can be affected by changes in the weather. Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas, and affect theprice of energy commodities. In addition, severe weather, including hurricanes and winter storms, can be destructive, causing outages and property damage that require incurring additional expenses. Additionally, droughts can result in reduced waterlevels that could adversely affect operations at some of the Companies power stations. Furthermore, the Companies operations could be adversely affected and their physical plant placed at greater risk of damage should changes in globalclimate produce, among other possible conditions, unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, abnormal levels of precipitation and, for operations located on or nearcoastlines, a change in sea level.  Dominion and Virginia Power are subjectto complex governmental regulation that could adversely affect their operations. Dominions and Virginia Powers operations are subject to extensive federal, state and localregulation and require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies. They must also comply with environmental legislation and associated regulations. Management believes that the necessary approvals have beenobtained for existing operations and that their business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws. However, new laws or regulations, the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations, or penalties imposed for non-compliancewith existing laws or regulations may require Dominion and Virginia Power to incur additional expenses.  Virginia Power could be subject to penalties as a result of mandatory reliability standards. As a result of EPACT, owners and operators of bulk powertransmission systems, including Virginia Power, are subject to mandatory reliability standards enacted by NERC and enforced by FERC. If Virginia Power is found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards it could be subject tosanctions, including substantial monetary penalties.  Dominions andVirginia Powers costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant, and the cost of compliance with future environmentallaws could adversely affect their cash flow and profitability. Dominions and Virginia Powers operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmentalstatutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources, and health and safety. Compliance with these legal requirements requires the Companies to commit significant capital toward permitting,emission fees, environ- -mental monitoring, installation and operation of pollution control equipment and purchase of allowances and/or offsets. Additionally, they could be responsible for expenses relating toremediation and containment obligations, including at sites where they have been identified by a regulatory agency as a potentially responsible party. Expenditures relating to environmental compliance have been significant in the past, and Dominionand Virginia Power expect that they will remain significant in the future. Costs of compliance with environmental regulations could adversely affect their results of operations and financial condition, especially if emission and/or discharge limitsare tightened, more extensive permitting requirements are imposed, additional substances become regulated and the number and types of assets Dominion and Virginia Power operate increases. Compliance costs cannot be estimated with certainty due tothe inability to predict the requirements and timing of implementation of any new environmental rules or regulations related to emissions. Other factors which affect the ability to predict future environmental expenditures with certainty include thedifficulty in estimating clean-up costs and quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all responsible parties.  If federal and/or state requirements are imposed on energy companiesmandating further emission reductions, including limitations on GHG emissions and reductions in SO2, NOxand mercury emissions and other environmental requirements relating to coal ash disposal and cooling water, such requirements may result in compliance costs that alone or in combination could make some of Dominions and Virginia Powerselectric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate. As related to GHG emissions, the U.S. Congress, environmental advocacy groups, other organizations and some state andfederal agencies are focusing considerable attention on GHG emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. Dominion and Virginia Power expect that federal legislation and/or EPA regulation, and possiblyadditional state legislation and/or regulation, may pass resulting in the imposition of limitations on GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. In December 2009, the EPA issued their Final Endangerment and Cause orContribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, finding that GHGs endanger both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations. If GHGs become regulated pollutantsunder the CAA, the Companies will be required to obtain permits for GHG emissions from new and modified facilities and amend operating permits for major sources of GHG emissions. Until these actions occur, and the EPA establishes guidance for GHGpermitting, including Best Available Control Technology, it is not possible to determine the impact on Dominions and Virginia Powers facilities that emit GHGs. However, such limits could make certain of the Companies electricgenerating units uneconomical to operate in the long term, unless there are significant advancements in the commercial availability and cost of carbon capture and storage technology. There are also potential impacts on Dominions natural gasbusinesses as federal GHG legislation may require GHG emission reductions from the natural gas sector and could affect demand for natural gas. Additionally, GHG requirements could result in increased demand for energy conservation and renewableproducts. Several regions of the U.S. have moved forward with GHG emission     21 Table of Contents   regulations including regions where Dominion has operations. For example, Massachusetts has implemented regulations requiring reductions in CO2 emissions and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap and trade program covering CO2 emissions from power plants in the Northeast, which affects several ofDominions facilities. In addition, a number of bills have been introduced in Congress that would require GHG emissions reductions from fossil fuel-fired electric generation facilities, natural gas facilities and other sectors of the economy,although none have yet been enacted. Compliance with these GHG emission reduction requirements may require committing significant capital toward carbon capture and storage technology, purchase of allowances and/or offsets, fuel switching, and/orretirement of high-emitting generation facilities and potential replacement with lower emitting generation facilities. The cost of compliance with expected GHG emission legislation and/or regulation is subject to significant uncertainties due to theoutcome of several interrelated assumptions and variables, including timing of the implementation of rules, required levels of reductions, allocation requirements of the new rules, the maturation and commercialization of carbon capture and storagetechnology and associated regulations, and the selected compliance alternatives. As a result, Dominion and Virginia Power cannot estimate the effect of any such legislation on their results of operations, financial condition or their customers. The base rates of Virginia Power are subject to regulatoryreview. As a result of the Regulation Act, in 2009, the Virginia Commission commenced its review of the base rates of Virginia Power under a modified cost-of-service model. Such rateswill be set based on analyses of Virginia Powers costs and capital structure, as reviewed and approved in regulatory proceedings. Under the Regulation Act, the Virginia Commission may, in a proceeding initiated in 2009, reduce rates or order acredit to customers if Virginia Power is deemed to be earning more than 50 basis points above an ROE level to be established by the Virginia Commission in that proceeding. After the initial rate case, the Virginia Commission will review the baserates of Virginia Power biennially and may order a credit to customers if it is deemed to have earned an ROE more than 50 basis points above an ROE level established by the Virginia Commission and may reduce rates if Virginia Power is found to havehad earnings in excess of the established ROE level during two consecutive biennial review periods.  The rates of Virginia Powers electric transmission operations and Dominions gas transmission operations are subject to regulatory review.Revenue provided by Virginia Powers electric transmission operations and Dominions gas transmission operations is based primarily on rates approved by FERC. The profitability of these businesses is dependent on their ability, through therates that they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on their capital investment.  Virginia Powers wholesale charges for electric transmission service are adjusted on an annual basis through operation of a FERC-approved formula rate mechanism. Through this mechanism Virginia Powers wholesale electrictransmission cost of service is estimated and thereafter trued-up as appropriate to reflect actual costs allocated to Virginia Power by PJM. These wholesale rates are subject to FERC review and prospective adjustment in the event that customersand/or interested state commissions file a complaint with FERC and are able to demonstrate that VirginiaPowers wholesale revenue requirement is no longer just and reasonable.  Similarly, various rates and charges assessed by Dominions gas transmission businesses are subject to review by FERC. Dominion is required to file a general base rate review for the FERC-jurisdictional services of Cove Point,effective not later than July 31, 2011. At that time, Cove Points cost of service will be reviewed by the FERC, with rates set based on analyses of the Companys costs and capital structure. The FERC-jurisdictional rates for DTI arethe subject of a 2005 FERC-approved settlement. That settlement established a rate moratorium that continues in effect through June 30, 2010.  Energy conservation could negatively impact Dominions and Virginia Powers financial results. Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by a fixed date. To the extent conservation resulted in reducedenergy demand or significantly slowed the growth in demand, the value of Dominions merchant generation, E&P assets and other unregulated business activities could be adversely impacted. In Virginia Powers regulated operations,conservation could negatively impact its results depending on the regulatory treatment of the associated impacts. Should Virginia Power be required to invest in conservation measures that resulted in reduced sales from effective conservation,regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a negative financial impact. Dominion and Virginia Power are unable to determine what impact, if any, conservation will have on their financial condition or results ofoperations.  Dominions merchant power business is operating in achallenging market, which could adversely affect its results of operations and future growth. The success of Dominions merchant power business depends upon favorable marketconditions including the ability to purchase and sell power at prices sufficient to cover its operating costs. Dominion operates in active wholesale markets that expose it to price volatility for electricity and fuel as well as the credit risk ofcounterparties. Dominion attempts to manage its price risk by entering into hedging transactions, including short-term and long-term fixed price sales and purchase contracts.  In these wholesale markets, the spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the cost of supplying the next unitof electricity to the market during that hour. In many cases, the next unit of electricity supplied would be provided by generating stations that consume fossil fuels, primarily natural gas. Consequently the open market wholesale price forelectricity generally reflects the cost of natural gas plus the cost to convert the fuel to electricity. Therefore changes in the price of natural gas generally affect the open market wholesale price of electricity. To the extent Dominion does notenter into long-term power purchase agreements or otherwise hedge its output, then these changes in market prices could adversely affect its financial results.  In addition, Dominion purchases fuel under a variety of terms, including long-term and short-term contracts and spot market purchases. Dominion is exposed to fuel cost volatility for the portion of itsfuel obtained through short-term contracts or on the spot market. Fuel prices can be volatile and the price that can be obtained for power produced from such fuel may not change at the same rate as fuel costs, thus adversely impactingDominions financial results.  22     Table of Contents   Lastly, Dominion is exposed to credit risks of its counterparties and the risk that one or more counterparties may fail to perform under theirobligations to make payments. Defaults by suppliers or other counterparties may adversely affect Dominions financial results.  Dominions merchant power business may be negatively affected by possible FERC actions that could weaken competition in the wholesale markets or affect pricing rules in the RTOmarkets. Dominions merchant generation stations operating in PJM, MISO and ISO-NE sell capacity, energy and ancillary services into wholesale electricity markets regulated by FERC.The wholesale markets allow these merchant generation stations to take advantage of market price opportunities, but also exposes them to market risk. Properly functioning competitive wholesale markets in PJM, MISO and ISO-NE depend upon FERCscontinuation of clearly identified market rules. From time to time FERC may investigate and authorize PJM, MISO and ISO-NE to make changes in market design. FERC also periodically reviews Dominions authority to sell at market-based rates.Material changes by FERC to the design of the wholesale markets or Dominions authority to sell power at market-based rates could adversely impact the future results of its merchant power business.  Dominions and Virginia Powers operations could be affected by terroristactivities and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism. In the event that their generating facilities or other infrastructure assets are subject to potential terroristactivities, such activities could significantly impair their operations and result in a decrease in revenues and additional costs to repair and insure their assets, which could have a material adverse effect on their business. The effects ofpotential terrorist activities could also include the risk of a significant decline in the U.S. economy, and the decreased availability and increased cost of insurance coverage, any of which could negatively impact the Companies results ofoperations and financial condition.  Dominion and Virginia Power have incurred increased capital and operating expenses and mayincur further costs for enhanced security in response to such risks.  Thereare risks associated with the operation of nuclear facilities. Dominion and Virginia Power operate nuclear facilities that are subject to risks, including their ability to dispose ofspent nuclear fuel, the disposal of which is subject to complex federal and state regulatory constraints. These risks also include the cost of and ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning, costs of replacement power, costs of plantmaintenance and exposure to potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities. Decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage are maintained to mitigate the financial exposure to these risks. However, it is possible thatdecommissioning costs could exceed the amount in the trusts or that costs arising from claims could exceed the amount of any insurance coverage.  The use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses and liquidity constraints. Dominion and Virginia Power use derivative instruments, including futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs, to manage commodity and financial market risks. In addition, Dominion purchases and sells commodity-based contracts primarily inthe natural gas market for trading purposes. The Companies could recognize financial losses on these contracts as a result of volatility in the market values of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to performunder a contract. In the absence of actively-quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these contracts involves managements judgment or use ofestimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.  In addition, Dominion uses derivatives primarily to hedge its merchant generation and gas and oil production. The use of such derivatives to hedge future electric and gas sales may limit the benefitDominion would otherwise receive from increases in commodity prices. These hedge arrangements generally include collateral requirements that require Dominion to deposit funds or post letters of credit with counterparties to cover the fair value ofcovered contracts in excess of agreed upon credit limits. For instance, when commodity prices rise to levels substantially higher than the levels where they have hedged future sales, Dominion may be required to use a material portion of itsavailable liquidity or obtain additional liquidity to cover these collateral requirements. In some circumstances, this could have a compounding effect on Dominions financial liquidity and results of operations.  Derivatives designated under hedge accounting to the extent not fully offset by the hedged transaction can result in ineffectiveness losses.These losses primarily result from differences in the location and specifications of the derivative hedging instrument and the hedged item and could adversely affect Dominions results of operations.  Dominions and Virginia Powers operations in regards to these transactions are subject to multiple market risks including marketliquidity, counterparty credit strength and price volatility. These market risks are beyond their control and could adversely affect their results of operations and future growth.  For additional information concerning derivatives and commodity-based trading contracts, see Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and RiskManagement in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Notes 2 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Dominions E&P business is affected by factors that cannot be predicted or controlled and that could damage facilities, disrupt production orreduce the book value of Dominions assets. Factors that may affect Dominions financial results include, but are not limited to: damage to or suspension of operations caused byweather, fire, explosion or other events at Dominions or third-party gas and oil facilities, fluctuations in natural gas and crude oil prices, results of future drilling and well completion activities, Dominions ability to acquireadditional land positions in competitive lease areas, drilling cost pressures, operational risks that could disrupt production, drilling rig availability and geological and other uncertainties inherent in the estimate of gas and oil reserves. Declines in natural gas and oil prices could adversely affect Dominions financial results by causing a permanentwrite-down of its natural gas and oil properties as required by the full cost method of accounting. Under the full cost method, all direct costs of property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. If net capitalizedcosts exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues from the production of proved gas and oil reserves using trailing twelve month average natural gas and oil prices (the ceiling test) at the end of any quarterly period, then a permanentwrite-down of the assets must be recognized in that period.      23 Table of Contents   Dominion and Virginia Power may not complete plant construction or expansion projects thatthey commence, or they may complete projects on materially different terms or timing than initially anticipated and they may not be ableto achieve the intended benefits of any such project, if completed. Several plant construction and expansion projects have been announced and additional projects may be considered in thefuture. Management anticipates that they will be required to seek additional financing in the future to fund current and future plant construction and expansion projects and may not be able to secure such financing on favorable terms. In addition,projects may not be able to be completed on time as a result of weather conditions, delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory approvals, delays in obtaining key materials, labor difficulties, difficulties with partners or potentialpartners, a decline in the credit strength of their counterparties or vendors, or other factors beyond their control. Even if plant construction and expansion projects are completed, the total costs of the projects may be higher than anticipated andthe performance of the business of Dominion and Virginia Power following the projects may not meet expectations. Additionally, regulators may disallow recovery of some of the costs of a project if they are deemed not to be prudently incurred.Further, Dominion and Virginia Power may not be able to timely and effectively integrate the projects into their operations and such integration may result in unforeseen operating difficulties or unanticipated costs. Any of these or other factorscould adversely affect their ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the plant construction and expansion projects.  An inability to access financial markets could affect the execution of Dominions and Virginia Powers business plans. Dominion and Virginia Power rely on access to short-term money markets, longer-term capital markets and banks as significant sources of funding and liquidity for capital expenditures, normal working capital and collateral requirementsrelated to hedges of future sales and purchases of energy-related commodities primarily associated with Dominions merchant generation and gas and oil production. Management believes that the Companies will maintain sufficient access to thesefinancial markets based upon their current credit ratings and market reputation. However, certain disruptions outside of Dominions and Virginia Powers control may increase their cost of borrowing or restrict their ability to access oneor more financial markets. Such disruptions could include delays in the current economic recovery, the bankruptcy of an unrelated company, general market disruption due to general credit market or political events, changes to their credit ratings orthe failure of financial institutions on which they rely. Restrictions on the Companies ability to access financial markets may affect their ability to execute their business plans as scheduled.  Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of decommissioning trust fundsand benefit plan assets or increase Dominions liabilities, which then could require significant additional funding. The performance of the capital markets affects the value of theassets that are held in trusts to satisfy future obligations to decommission Dominions nuclear plants and under its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Dominion has significant obligations in these areas and holds significantassets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below expected return rates. Adecline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations to decommission Dominions nuclear plants and under its pension and other postretirementbenefit plans. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under Dominions pension and other postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding.Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans. If the decommissioning trustfunds and benefit plan assets are not successfully managed, Dominions results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected.  Changing rating agency requirements could negatively affect Dominions and Virginia Powers growth and business strategy. As of February 1, 2010, Dominions senior unsecured debt is rated A-, stable outlook, by Standard & Poors; Baa2, stable outlook, by Moodys; and BBB+, stable outlook, by Fitch. Asof February 1, 2010, Virginia Powers senior unsecured debt is rated A-, stable outlook, by Standard & Poors; Baa1, positive outlook, by Moodys; and A-, stable outlook, by Fitch. In order to maintain current creditratings in light of existing or future requirements, Dominion and Virginia Power may find it necessary to take steps or change their business plans in ways that may adversely affect their growth and earnings. A reduction in Dominions creditratings or the credit ratings of Virginia Power by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch could result in an increase in borrowing costs, loss of access to certain markets, or both, thus adversely affecting operating results andcould require Dominion to post additional collateral in connection with some of its price risk management activities.  Potential changes in accounting practices may adversely affect Dominions and Virginia Powers financial results.Dominion and Virginia Power cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on public companies in general, the energy industry or their operations specifically. New accounting standards could be issuedthat could change the way they record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. These changes in accounting standards could adversely affect reported earnings or could increase reported liabilities.

  Our business isinfluenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyond our control. We have identified a number of these factors below. For other factors that may cause actualresults to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement or projection contained in this report, see Forward-Looking Statements in MD&A.  Our results of operations can be affected by changes in the weather. Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas, and affect the price of energy commodities. In addition, severe weather, including hurricanes and winter storms, can be destructive, causing outages andproperty damage that require us to incur additional expenses. Additionally, droughts can result in reduced water levels that could adversely affect operations at some of our power stations.  We are subject to complex governmental regulation that could adversely affect our operations. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation and require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various governmental  agencies. We must also comply with environmental legislation and associated regulations. Management believes that the necessary approvals have been obtainedfor our existing operations and that our business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws. However, new laws or regulations, the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations, or penalties imposed for non-compliance withexisting laws or regulations may require us to incur additional expenses.  We could be subject topenalties as a result of mandatory reliability standards. As a result of EPACT, owners and operators of bulk power transmission systems, including Dominion, are subject to mandatory reliabilitystandards enacted by NERC and enforced by FERC. If we are found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties.  Our costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant, and the cost of compliance with futureenvironmental laws could adversely affect our cash flow and profitability. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating toair quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources, and health and safety. Compliance with these legal requirements requires us to commit significant capital toward permitting, emission fees, environmental monitoring, installation andoperation of pollution control equipment and purchase of allowances and/or offsets. Additionally, we could be responsible for expenses relating to remediation and containment obligations, including at sites where we have been identified by aregulatory agency as a PRP. Our expenditures relating to environmental compliance have been significant in the past, and we expect that they will remain significant in the future. Costs of compliance with environmental regulations could adverselyaffect our results of operations and financial condition, especially if emission and/or discharge limits are tightened, more extensive permitting requirements are imposed, additional substances become regulated and the number and types of assets weoperate increases. We cannot estimate our compliance costs with certainty due to our inability to predict the requirements and timing of implementation of any new environmental rules or regulations related to emissions. Other factors which affectour ability to predict our future environmental expenditures with certainty include the difficulty in estimating clean-up costs and quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all responsible parties. If federal and/or state requirements areimposed on energy companies mandating further emission reductions, including limitations on CO2 emissions, such requirements could make some of our electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate. Environmental advocacy groups, other organizations and some agencies are focusing considerable attention on CO2emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. We expect that federal legislation, and possibly additional state legislation, may pass resulting in the imposition of limitations on GHG emissions from fossilfuel-fired electric generating units. Such limits could make certain of our electric generating units uneconomical to operate in the long term, unless there are significant advancements in the commercial availability and cost of carbon capture andstorage technology. There are also potential impacts on our natural gas businesses as federal GHG legislation may require GHG emission reduction requirements from the   20      Table of Contents    natural gas sector. Several regions of the U.S. have moved forward with GHG emission regulations including regions where we have operations. For example,Massachusetts has implemented regulations requiring reductions in CO2 emissions and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap and trade programcovering CO2 emissions from power plants in the Northeast, affects several of our facilities. In addition, a number of bills have been introduced inCongress that would require GHG emissions reductions from fossil fuel-fired electric generation facilities, natural gas facilities and other sectors of the economy, although none have yet been enacted. Compliance with these GHG emission reductionrequirements may require us to commit significant capital toward carbon capture and storage technology, purchase of allowances and/or offsets, fuel switching, and/or retirement of high-emitting generation facilities and potential replacement withlower emitting generation facilities. The cost of compliance with expected GHG emission legislation is subject to significant uncertainties due to the outcome of several interrelated assumptions and variables, including timing of the implementationof rules, required levels of reductions, allocation requirements of the new rules, the maturation and commercialization of carbon capture and storage technology and associated regulations, and our selected compliance alternatives. As a result, wecannot estimate the effect of any such legislation on our results of operations, financial condition or our customers.  The base rates of our Virginia electric utility are subject to regulatory review. As a result of the Regulation Act, commencing in 2009 the base rates of our electric utilitycompany will be reviewed by the Virginia Commission under a modified cost-of-service model. Such rates will be set based on analyses of our electric utilitys costs and capital structure, as reviewed and approved in regulatory proceedings.Under the Regulation Act, the Virginia Commission may, in a proceeding conducted in 2009, reduce rates or order a credit to customers if our electric utility company is deemed to be earning more than 50 basis points above an ROE level to beestablished by the Virginia Commission in that proceeding. After the initial rate case, the Virginia Commission will review the base rates of our electric utility company biennially and may order a credit to customers if it is deemed to have earnedan ROE more than 50 basis points above an ROE level established by the Virginia Commission and may reduce rates if our electric utility company is found to have had earnings in excess of the established ROE level during two consecutive biennialreview periods.  Delays in the recovery of fuel costs at our regulated electric utility couldnegatively affect our electric utilitys cash flow, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Our regulated electric utility has a statutory right to recover from customers allprudently incurred fuel costs through fuel factors which have been implemented in our Virginia and North Carolina jurisdictions. However, as a result of increasing fuel costs and a statutory limitation on the amount of fuel recovery that could becollected from Virginia jurisdictional customers in the July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2008 fuel factor period, our electric utility has deferred a significant amount of fuel costs. Deferred recovery of fuel costs could have a negativeimpact on the cash flow of our electric utility. The recent fluctuations in fuel prices may make it difficult to accurately predict fuel costs. In the future, if actual fuel costs incurred during the fuel factor period exceed theesti mate of costs which the Virginia Commission has approved for recovery in that period, we will not have authority to recover the excess costs through fuelrates until the following year when a new factor is determined. To the extent that such deferrals occur, the resulting delays in the current recovery of fuel costs could negatively impact the cash flow of our electric utility, which could adverselyaffect our results of operations.  The rates of our electric and gas transmission operations aresubject to regulatory review. Revenue provided by our electric and gas transmission operations is based primarily on rates approved by FERC. The profitability of these businesses is dependenton their ability, through the rates that they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on their capital investment.  Our wholesale charges for electric transmission service are adjusted on an annual basis through operation of a FERC-approved formula rate mechanism. Through this mechanism our wholesale electric transmission cost ofservice is estimated and thereafter trued-up as appropriate to reflect actual costs allocated to the Company by PJM. These wholesale rates are subject to FERC review and prospective adjustment in the event that customers and/or interested statecommissions file a complaint with FERC and are able to demonstrate that our wholesale revenue requirement is no longer just and reasonable.  Similarly, various rates and charges assessed by our gas transmission businesses are subject to review by FERC. We are required to file a general base rate review for the FERC-jurisdictional services of Cove Point, effective not later thanJuly 31, 2011. At that time, Cove Points cost of service will be reviewed by the FERC, with rates set based on analyses of the companys costs and capital structure. The FERC-jurisdictional rates for DTI are the subject of a 2005FERC-approved settlement. That settlement established a rate moratorium that continues in effect through June 30, 2010.  Energy conservation could negatively impact our financial results. Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentivesto reduce energy consumption by a fixed date. To the extent conservation resulted in reduced energy demand or significantly slowed the growth in demand, the value of our merchant generation, E&P assets and other unregulated business activitiescould be adversely impacted. In our regulated operations, conservation could negatively impact Dominion depending on the regulatory treatment of the associated impacts. Should we be required to invest in conservation measures that resulted inreduced sales from effective conservation, regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a negative financial impact. We are unable to determine what impact, if any, conservation will have on our financial conditionor results of operations.  Our merchant power business isoperating in a challenging market, which could adversely affect our results of operations and future growth. The success of our merchant power business depends upon favorable market conditions including our ability to purchase and sell power at prices sufficient to cover our operating costs. We operatein active wholesale markets that expose us to price volatility for electricity and fuel as well as the credit risk of counterparties. We attempt to manage our price risk by entering into hedging transactions, including short-term and long-term fixedprice sales and purchase contracts.       21  Table of Contents    In these wholesale markets, the spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the cost of supplying the next unit of electricityto the market during that hour. In many cases, the next unit of electricity supplied would be provided by generating stations that consume fossil fuels, primarily natural gas. Consequently the open market wholesale price for electricity generallyreflects the cost of natural gas plus the cost to convert the fuel to electricity. Therefore changes in the price of natural gas generally affect the open market wholesale price of electricity. To the extent we do not enter into long-term powerpurchase agreements or otherwise hedge our output, then these changes in market prices could adversely affect our financial results.  Inaddition, we purchase fuel under a variety of terms, including long-term and short-term contracts and spot market purchases. We are exposed to fuel cost volatility for the portion of our fuel obtained through short-term contracts or on the spotmarket. Fuel prices can be volatile and the price that can be obtained for power produced from such fuel may not change at the same rate as fuel costs, thus adversely impacting our financial results.  Lastly, we are exposed to credit risks of our counterparties and the risk that one or more counterparties may fail to perform under their obligations tomake payments. Defaults by suppliers or other counterparties may adversely affect our financial results.  Our merchant power business may be negatively affected by possible FERC actions that could weaken competition in the wholesale markets or affect pricing rules in the RTOmarkets. Our merchant generation stations operating in PJM and NEPOOL sell capacity, energy and ancillary services into wholesale electricitymarkets regulated by FERC. The wholesale markets allow these merchant generation stations to take advantage of market price opportunities, but also exposes them to market risk. Properly functioning competitive wholesale markets in PJM and NEPOOLdepend upon FERCs continuation of clearly identified market rules. From time to time FERC may investigate and authorize PJM and NEPOOL to make changes in market design. FERC also periodically reviews our authority to sell at market-basedrates. Material changes by FERC to the design of the wholesale markets or our authority to sell power at market-based rates could adversely impact the future results of our merchant power business.  Our operations could be affected by terrorist activities and catastrophic events that could result fromterrorism. In the event that our generating facilities or other infrastructure assets are subject to potential terrorist activities, such activities could significantly impair our operations andresult in a decrease in revenues and additional costs to repair and insure our assets, which could have a material adverse effect on Dominions business. The effects of potential terrorist activities could also include the risk of a significantdecline in the U.S. economy, and the decreased availability and increased cost of insurance coverage, any of which effects could negatively impact our operations and financial condition.  We have incurred increased capital and operating expenses and may incur further costs for enhanced security in response to such risks.  There are risks associated with the operation of nuclear facilities. We operate nuclear facilities that are subject to risks, including our ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel, the disposal of which is subject to complex federal and state regulatory constraints.  These risks also include the cost of and our ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning, costs of replacement power, costs of plantmaintenance and exposure to potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities. We maintain decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage to mitigate the financial exposure to these risks. However, it is possible thatdecommissioning costs could exceed the amount in our trusts or that costs arising from claims could exceed the amount of any insurance coverage.  The use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses and liquidity constraints. We use derivative instruments, including futures, swaps,forwards, options and financial transmission rights (FTRs) to manage our commodity and financial market risks. In addition, we purchase and sell commodity-based contracts primarily in the natural gas market for trading purposes. We could recognizefinancial losses on these contracts as a result of volatility in the market values of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract. In the absence of actively-quoted market prices and pricing information fromexternal sources, the valuation of these contracts involves managements judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of thesecontracts.  In addition, we use derivatives to hedge our electric and gas operations. The use of such derivatives to hedge future electricand gas sales may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in commodity prices. These hedge arrangements generally include collateral requirements that require us to deposit funds or post letters of credit with counterparties tocover the fair value of covered contracts in excess of agreed upon credit limits. For instance, when commodity prices rise to levels substantially higher than the levels where we have hedged future sales, we may be required to use a material portionof our available liquidity or obtain additional liquidity to cover these collateral requirements. In some circumstances, this could have a compounding effect on our financial liquidity and results of operations.  Derivatives designated under hedge accounting to the extent not fully offset by the hedged transaction can result in ineffectiveness losses. These lossesprimarily result from differences in the location and specifications of the derivative hedging instrument and the hedged item and could adversely affect our results of operations.  Our operations in regards to these transactions are subject to multiple market risks including market liquidity, counterparty credit strength and pricevolatility. These market risks are beyond our control and could adversely affect our results of operations and future growth.  Foradditional information concerning derivatives and commodity-based trading contracts, see Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Risk Management in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Notes 2 and 9 toour Consolidated Financial Statements.  Our E&P business is affected by factors that cannot bepredicted or controlled and that could damage facilities, disrupt production or reduce the book value of our assets. Factors that may affect our financial results include, but are not limited to:damage to or suspension of operations caused by weather, fire, explosion or other events at our or third-party gas and oil facilities, fluctuations in natural gas and crude oil prices, results of future drilling and well completion   22      Table of Contents    activities, our ability to acquire additional land positions in competitive lease areas, drilling cost pressures, operational risks that could disruptproduction, drilling rig availability and geological and other uncertainties inherent in the estimate of gas and oil reserves.  Short-termmarket declines in the prices of natural gas and oil could adversely affect our financial results by causing a permanent write-down of our natural gas and oil properties as required by the full cost method of accounting. Under the full cost method,all direct costs of property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. If net capitalized costs exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues based on hedge-adjusted period-end prices from the production ofproved gas and oil reserves (the ceiling test) at the end of any quarterly period, then a permanent write-down of the assets must be recognized in that period.  We may not complete plant construction or expansion projects that we commence, or we may complete projects on materially different terms or timing than initially anticipated andwe may not be able to achieve the intended benefits of any such project, if completed. We have announced several plant construction and expansion projects and may consider additional projects in thefuture. We anticipate that we will be required to seek additional financing in the future to fund our current and future plant construction and expansion projects and we may not be able to secure such financing on favorable terms. In addition, wemay not be able to complete the projects on time as a result of weather conditions, delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory approvals, delays in obtaining key materials, labor difficulties, difficulties with partners or potentialpartners, a decline in the credit strength of our counterparties or vendors, or other factors beyond our control. With respect to our LNG and gas transmission pipeline operations, if we do not meet designated schedules for approval and constructionof our plant and expansion projects, certain of our customers may have the right to terminate their precedent agreements relating to the expansion projects. Certain of our customers may also have the right to receive liquidated damages. Even ifplant construction and expansion projects are completed, the total costs of the projects may be higher than anticipated and the performance of our business following the projects may not meet expectations. Additionally, regulators may disallowrecovery of some of the costs of a project if they are deemed not to be prudently incurred. Further, we may not be able to timely and effectively integrate the projects into our operations and such integration may result in unforeseen operatingdifficulties or unanticipated costs. Any of these or other factors could adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the plant construction and expansion projects.  An inability to access financial markets could affect the execution ofour business plan. Dominion and our subsidiary, Virginia Power, rely on access to short-term money markets, longer-term capital markets and banks assignificant sources of funding and liquidity for capital expenditures, normal working capital and collateral requirements related to hedges of future sales and purchases of energy-related commodities primarily associated with our merchant generationand gas and oil production. Management believes that Dominion and Virginia Power will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets based upon our current credit ratings and market reputation. However, certain dis- ruptions outside of our control may increase our cost of borrowing or restrict our ability to access one or more financial markets. Such disruptions couldinclude a continuation of the current economic downturn, the bankruptcy of an unrelated company, general market disruption due to general credit market or political events, changes to our credit ratings or the failure of financial institutions onwhich we rely. Restrictions on our ability to access financial markets may affect our ability to execute our business plan as scheduled.  Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets or increase our liabilities, which then could require significant additionalfunding. The performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations to decommission our nuclear plants and under our pension andpostretirement benefit plans. We have significant obligations in these areas and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below our expected returnrates. A decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations to decommission our nuclear plants and under our pension and postretirement benefit plans. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect theliabilities under our pension and postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changesin life expectancy assumptions, may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans. If the decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets are not successfully managed, our results of operationsand financial condition could be negatively affected.  Changing rating agency requirements couldnegatively affect our growth and business strategy. As of February 1, 2009, Dominions senior unsecured debt is rated A-, stable outlook, by Standard & Poors; Baa2, stableoutlook, by Moodys; and BBB+, stable outlook, by Fitch. In order to maintain our current credit ratings in light of existing or future requirements, we may find it necessary to take steps or change our business plans in ways that may adverselyaffect our growth and earnings per share. A reduction in Dominions credit ratings or the credit ratings of our Virginia Power subsidiary by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch could increase our borrowing costs and adverselyaffect operating results and could require us to post additional collateral in connection with some of our price risk management activities.  Potential changes in accounting practices may adversely affect our financial results. We cannot predict the impact that future changes in accountingstandards or practices may have on public companies in general, the energy industry or our operations specifically. New accounting standards could be issued that could change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Thesechanges in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported earnings or could increase reported liabilities.  Failure to retain and attract key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on our operations. Our businessstrategy is dependent on our ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees. Competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to retain and attract these employees could adversely affect our business and future operatingresults.       23  Table of Contents   "
12,D,DOMINION ENERGY INC,2008-02-28,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
  Our business is influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties thatmay materially affect actual results and are often beyond our control. We have identified a number of these factors below. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement orprojection contained in this report, see Forward-Looking Statements in MD&A.       13  Table of Contents    Our operations are weather sensitive. Our results of operations can beaffected by changes in the weather. Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas, and affect the price of energy commodities. In addition, severe weather, including hurricanes and winter storms, can bedestructive, causing outages and property damage that require us to incur additional expenses. In addition, droughts can result in reduced water levels that could adversely affect operations at some of our power stations.  We are subject to complex governmental regulation that could adversely affect our operations. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation and require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies. We must also comply with environmentallegislation and associated regulations. Management believes that the necessary approvals have been obtained for our existing operations and that our business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws. However, new laws or regulations, therevision or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations, or penalties imposed for non-compliance with existing laws or regulations may require us to incur additional expenses.  We could be subject to penalties as a result of mandatory reliability standards. As a result of EPACT, owners and operators of bulk power transmission systems, including Dominion, are subject to mandatory reliability standards enacted by NERC and enforced by FERC. If we are found not be incompliance with the mandatory reliability standards we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties.  Our costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant, and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws could adversely affect our cash flow and profitability. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources, and health and safety.Compliance with these legal requirements requires us to commit significant capital toward permitting, emission fees, environmental monitoring, installation and operation of pollution control equipment and purchase of allowances and/or offsets.Additionally, we could be responsible for expenses relating to remediation and containment obligations, including at sites where we have been identified by a regulatory agency as a PRP. Our expenditures relating to environmental compliance have beensignificant in the past, and we expect that they will remain significant in the future. Costs of compliance with environmental regulations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position, especially if emission and/ordischarge limits are tightened, more extensive permitting requirements are imposed, additional substances become regulated and the number and types of assets we operate increases. We cannot estimate our compliance costs with certainty due to ourinability to predict the requirements and timing of implementation of any new environmental rules or regulations related to emissions. Other factors which affect our ability to predict our future environmental expenditures with certainty include thedifficulty in estimating clean-up costs and quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all responsible parties.  If federal and/or state requirements are imposed on energy companies mandating further emission reductions, including limitations on carbon dioxide emissions, such requirements could make some of our electric generating units uneconomical tomaintain or operate. Environmental advocacy groups, other organizations and some  agencies are focusing considerable attention on carbon dioxide emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. Weexpect that federal legislation, and possibly additional state legislation, may pass resulting in the imposition of limitations on greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. Such limits could make certain of ourelectric generating units uneconomical to operate in the long term, unless there are significant improvements in the commercial availability and cost of carbon capture and sequestration technology. There are also potential impacts on our natural gasbusinesses as federal greenhouse gas legislation may require greenhouse gas emission reduction requirements from the natural gas sector. Several regions of the U.S. have moved forward with greenhouse gas regulations including regions where we haveoperations. For example, Massachusetts has implemented regulations requiring reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap and trade program covering carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in theNortheast, will affect several of our facilities. In addition, a number of bills have been introduced in Congress that would require greenhouse gas emissions reductions from fossil fuel-fired electric generation facilities, natural gas facilitiesand other sectors of the economy, although none have yet been enacted. Compliance with these greenhouse gas emission reduction requirements may require us to commit significant capital toward carbon capture and sequestration technology, purchase ofallowances and/or offsets, fuel switching, and/or retirement of high-emitting generation facilities and replacement with lower emitting generation facilities. The costs of compliance with expected greenhouse gas legislation are subject tosignificant uncertainties due to the outcome of several interrelated assumptions and variables, including timing of the implementation of rules, required levels of reductions, allocation requirements of the new rules, the maturation andcommercialization of carbon capture and sequestration technology and associated regulations, and our selected compliance alternatives. As a result, we cannot estimate the effect of any such legislation on our results of operations, financialcondition or our customers.  We are exposed to cost-recovery shortfalls because of capped base ratesfor our regulated electric utility. Under the Restructuring Act, as amended in 2004 and 2007, our base rates remain capped through December 31, 2008. Although the Restructuring Act allows for therecovery of certain generation-related costs during the capped rates period, we remain exposed to numerous risks of cost-recovery shortfalls, such as costs related to hurricanes or other unanticipated events.  The rates of our Virginia electric utility are subject to regulatory review. As a result of the Restructuring Act, commencing in 2009 the base rates of our electric utility company will be reviewed by the Virginia Commission under a modified cost-of-service model. Such rates will be set based on analyses of ourelectric utilitys costs and capital structures, as reviewed and approved in regulatory proceedings. Under the Restructuring Act, the Virginia Commission may, in a proceeding conducted in 2009, reduce rates or order a credit to customers if ourelectric utility company is deemed to have earnings during a 2008 test period which are more than 50 basis points above a return on equity level to be established by the Virginia Commission in that proceeding. After the initial rate case, theVirginia Commission will review the rates of our electric utility company biennially and may order a credit   14      Table of Contents    to customers if it is deemed to have earned more than 50 basis points above a return on equity level established by the Virginia Commission and may reducerates if our electric utility company is found to have had earnings in excess of the established return on equity level during two consecutive biennial review periods.  Energy conservation could negatively impact our financial results. A number of regulatory and legislative bodies haveintroduced requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates. Conservation programs could impact our financial results in different ways. To the extent conservation resulted in reduced energy demand or significantly slowedthe growth in demand, the value of our merchant generation, E&P assets and other unregulated business activities could be adversely impacted. In our regulated operations, conservation could negatively impact Dominion depending on the regulatorytreatment of the associated impacts. Should we be required to invest in conservation measures that resulted in reduced sales from effective conservation, regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a negativefinancial impact. We are unable to determine what impact, if any, conservation will have on our financial condition or results of operations.  Our merchant power business is operating in a challenging market, which could adversely affect our results of operations and future growth. The successof our merchant power business depends upon favorable market conditions as well as our ability to find buyers willing to enter into power purchase agreements at prices sufficient to cover operating costs. We attempt to manage these risks by enteringinto both short-term and long-term fixed price sales and purchase contracts and locating our assets in active wholesale energy markets. However, high fuel and commodity costs and excess capacity in the industry could adversely impact our results ofoperations.  There are risks associated with the operation of nuclear facilities. We operate nuclear facilities that are subject to risks, including the threat of terrorist attack and our ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel, the disposal of which is subject to complex federal and stateregulatory constraints. These risks also include the cost of and our ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning, costs of replacement power, costs of plant maintenance and exposure to potential liabilities arising out of the operationof these facilities. We maintain decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage to mitigate the financial exposure to these risks. However, it is possible that decommissioning costs could exceed the amount in our trusts or that costs arisingfrom claims could exceed the amount of any insurance coverage.  The use of derivative instrumentscould result in financial losses and liquidity constraints. We use derivative instruments, including futures, swaps, forwards, options and financial transmission rights to manage our commodity andfinancial market risks. In addition, we purchase and sell commodity-based contracts primarily in the natural gas market for trading purposes. We could recognize financial losses on these contracts as a result of volatility in the market values ofthe underlying commodities or if the counterparty fails to perform under a contract. In the absence of actively-quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these contracts involves managements judgmentor use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.  In addition, we use derivatives to hedge futuresales of our merchant generation and gas production, which may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in commodity prices. These hedge arrangements generally include collateral requirements that require us to deposit funds orpost letters of credit with counterparties to cover the fair value of covered contracts in excess of agreed upon credit limits. When commodity prices rise to levels substantially higher than the levels where we have hedged future sales, we may berequired to use a material portion of our available liquidity and obtain additional liquidity to cover these collateral requirements. In some circumstances, this could have a compounding effect on our financial liquidity and results of operations. Derivatives designated under hedge accounting to the extent not fully offset by the hedged transaction can result in ineffectivenesslosses. These losses primarily result from differences in the location and specifications of the derivative hedging instrument and the hedged item and could adversely affect our results of operations.

Our E&P business is affected by factors that cannotbe predicted or controlled and that could damage facilities, disrupt production or reduce the book value of our assets. Factors that may affect our financial results include, but are not limited to:damage to or suspension of operations caused by weather, fire, explosion or other events at our or third-party gas and oil facilities, fluctuations in natural gas and crude oil prices, results of future drilling and well completion activities, ourability to acquire additional land positions in competitive lease areas, drilling cost pressures, operational risks that could disrupt production, drilling rig availability and geological and other uncertainties inherent in the estimate of gas andoil reserves.  Short-term market declines in the prices of natural gas and oil could adversely affect our financial results by causing apermanent write-down of our natural gas and oil properties as required by the full cost method of accounting. Under the full cost method, all direct costs of property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. If netcapitalized costs exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues based on hedge-adjusted period-end prices from the production of proved gas and oil reserves (the ceiling test) at the end of any quarterly period, then a permanentwrite-down of the assets must be recognized in that period.  We may not complete plant construction orexpansion projects that we commence, or we may complete projects on materially different terms or timing than initially anticipated and we may not be able toachieve the intended benefits of any such project, if completed. We have announced several plant construction and expansion projects and may consider additional plant construction and expansion      15  Table of Contents    projects in the future. We anticipate that we will be required to seek additional financing in the future to fund our current and future plant constructionand expansion projects and we may not be able to secure such financing on favorable terms. In addition, we may not be able to complete the plant construction or expansion projects on time as a result of weather conditions, delays in obtaining orfailure to obtain regulatory approvals, delays in obtaining key materials, labor difficulties, difficulties with partners or other factors beyond our control. With respect to our LNG and gas transmission pipeline operations, if we do not meetdesignated schedules for approval and construction of our plant and expansion projects, certain of our customers may have the right to terminate their precedent agreements relating to the expansion projects. Certain of our customers may also havethe right to receive liquidated damages. Even if plant construction and expansion projects are completed, the total costs of the plant construction and expansion projects may be higher than anticipated and the performance of our business followingthe plant construction and expansion projects may not meet expectations. Additionally, regulators may disallow recovery of some of the costs of a plant or expansion project if they are deemed not to be prudently incurred. Any of these or otherfactors could adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the plant construction and expansion projects.  An inability to access financial markets could affect the execution of our business plan. Dominion and our subsidiary, Virginia Power, rely on access toshort-term money markets, longer-term capital markets and banks as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements and collateral requirements, related to hedges of future sales of merchant generation and gas and oil production, notsatisfied by the cash flows from our operations. Management believes that Dominion and Virginia Power will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets based upon current credit ratings. However, certain disruptions outside of our controlmay increase our cost of borrowing or restrict our ability to access one or more financial markets. Such disruptions could include an economic downturn, the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company or changes to our credit ratings. Restrictions onour ability to access financial markets may affect our ability to execute our business plan as scheduled.  Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets or increase our liabilities, which then could require significant additional funding. The performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations to decommission our nuclear plants and under our pension and postretirement benefit plans.We have significant obligations in these areas and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below our projected return rates. A decline in the marketvalue of the assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations to decommission our nuclear plants and under our pension and postretirement benefit plans. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under our pensionand postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions,may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans. If we are unable to successfully manage the  decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets, our results of operation and financial position could be negatively affected.  Changing rating agency requirements could negatively affect our growth and business strategy. As of February 1, 2008, Dominions senior unsecured debt is rated A-, stable outlook, by Standard & Poors Ratings Services, a division of the McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (Standard &Poors); Baa2, stable outlook, by Moodys Investors Services (Moodys); and BBB+, stable outlook, by Fitch Ratings Ltd. (Fitch). In order to maintain our current credit ratings in light of existing or future requirements, we may findit necessary to take steps or change our business plans in ways that may adversely affect our growth and earnings per share. A reduction in Dominions credit ratings or the credit ratings of our Virginia Power subsidiary by Standard &Poors, Moodys or Fitch could increase our borrowing costs and adversely affect operating results and could require us to post additional collateral in connection with some of our price risk management activities.  Potential changes in accounting practices may adversely affect our financial results. We cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on public companies in general, the energy industry or our operations specifically. New accounting standards could beissued that could change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. These changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported earnings or could increase reported liabilities.  Failure to retain and attract key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees couldhave an adverse effect on our operations.

  Our business is influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that maymaterially affect actual results and are often beyond our control. We have identified a number of these factors below. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement orprojection contained in this report, see Forward-Looking Statements in MD&A.  Our operations are weather sensitive. Our results ofoperations can be affected by changes in the weather. Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities. In addition, severe weather, including hurricanes, winter storms anddroughts, can be destructive, causing outages, production delays and property damage that require us to incur additional expenses.  We are subjectto complex governmental regulation that could adversely affect our operations. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation and may require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various governmentalagencies. We must also comply with environmental legislation and associated regulations. Management believes the necessary approvals have been obtained for our existing operations and that our business is conducted in accordance with applicablelaws. However, new laws or regulations, or the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations, may require us to incur additional expenses.  Costs of environmental compliance, liabilities and litigation could exceed our estimates, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations may resultin increased capital, operating and other costs, including remediation and containment expenses and monitoring obligations. In addition, we may be a responsible party for environmental clean-up at a site identified by a regulatory body. Managementcannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean-up and compliance costs, and the possibility that changes will be made to the currentenvironmental laws and regulations. There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties.  We are exposed to cost-recovery shortfalls because of capped base rates and amendments to the fuel factor statute in effect in Virginia for our regulatedelectric utility. Under the Virginia Restructuring Act, as amended in 2004, our base rates (excluding, generally, a fuel factor with limited adjustment provisions, and certain other allowable adjustments) remain capped through December 31,2010 unless modified or terminated consistent with the Virginia Restructuring Act. Although the Virginia Restructuring Act allows for the recovery of certain generation-related costs during the capped rates period, we remain exposed to numerousrisks of cost-recovery shortfalls. These include exposure to stranded costs, future environmental compliance requirements, certain tax law changes, costs related to hurricanes or other weather events, inflation, the cost of obtaining replacementpower during unplanned plant outages and increased capital costs.  In addition, under the 2004 amendments to the Virginia fuel factor statute, ourcurrent Virginia fuel factor provisions are locked-in until the earlier of July 1, 2007 or the termination of capped rates by order of the Virginia Commission, with no deferred fuel accounting. The amendments provide for a one-time adjustment of our fuel factor, effective July 1, 2007 through December 31, 2010 (unless capped rates are terminated earlier), with no adjustment for previously incurred over-recovery or under-recovery. As aresult of the current locked-in fuel factor and the uncertainty of what the one-time adjustment will be, we are exposed to fuel price and other risks. These risks include exposure to increased costs of fuel, including purchased power costs,differences between our projected and actual power generation mix and generating unit performance (which affects the types and amounts of fuel we use), and differences between fuel price assumptions and actual fuel prices.  Under the Virginia Restructuring Act, the generation portion of our electric utility operations is open to competition and resulting uncertainty. Under theVirginia Restructuring Act, the generation portion of our electric utility operations in Virginia is open to competition and is no longer subject to cost-based regulation. To date, a competitive retail market has been slow to develop. Consequently,it is difficult to predict the pace at which a competitive environment will evolve and the extent to which we will face increased competition and be able to operate profitably within this competitive environment.  Our merchant power business is operating in a challenging market, which could adversely affect our results of operations and future growth. The success ofour merchant power business depends upon favorable market conditions as well as our ability to find buyers willing to enter into power purchase agreements at prices sufficient to cover operating costs. We attempt to manage these risks by enteringinto both short-term and long-term fixed price sales and purchase contracts and locating our assets in active wholesale energy markets. However, high fuel and commodity costs and excess capacity in the industry could adversely impact results ofoperations.  There are risks associated with the operation of nuclear facilities. We operate nuclear facilities that are subject to risks,including the threat of terrorist attack and ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel, the disposal of which is subject to complex federal and state regulatory constraints. These risks also include the cost of and our ability to maintain adequatereserves for decommissioning, costs of replacement power, costs of plant maintenance and exposure to potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities. We maintain decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage to managethe financial exposure to these risks. However, it is possible that costs arising from claims could exceed the amount of any insurance coverage.  The use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses and liquidity constraints. We use derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, financial transmission rights, options and swaps, to manage our commodity andfinancial market risks. In addition, we purchase and sell commodity-based contracts in the natural gas, electricity and oil markets for trading purposes. We could recognize financial losses on these contracts as a result of volatility in the marketvalues of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these contracts involves managementsjudgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.  In addition, we use financial derivatives to hedge future sales of our merchant generation and gas and oil production, which may limit the benefit we wouldotherwise receive from increases in commodity prices. These hedge arrangements generally   11 Table of Contents  include collateral requirements that require us to deposit funds or post letters of credit with counterparties to cover the fair value of covered contracts in excessof agreed upon credit limits. When commodity prices rise to levels substantially higher than the levels where we have hedged future sales, we may be required to use a material portion of our available liquidity and obtain additional liquidity tocover these collateral requirements. In some circumstances, this could have a compounding effect on our financial liquidity and results.  Derivativesdesignated under hedge accounting to the extent not offset by the hedged transaction can result in ineffectiveness losses. These losses primarily result from differences in the location and specifications of the derivative hedging instrument and thehedged item and could adversely affect our results of operations.  Our operations in regards to these transactions are subject to multiple marketrisks including market liquidity, counterparty credit strength and price volatility. These market risks are beyond our control and could adversely affect our results of operations and future growth.  For additional information concerning derivatives and commodity-based trading contracts, see Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Risk Management in Item7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Notes 2 and 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  Our exploration andproduction business is dependent on factors that cannot be predicted or controlled and that could damage facilities, disrupt production or reduce the book value of our assets. Factors that may affect our financial results include damage to orsuspension of operations caused by weather, fire, explosion or other events to our or third-party gas and oil facilities, fluctuations in natural gas and crude oil prices, results of future drilling and well completion activities, and our ability toacquire additional land positions in competitive lease areas, as well as inherent operational risks that could disrupt production.  Short-term marketdeclines in the prices of natural gas and oil could adversely affect our financial results by causing a permanent write-down of our natural gas and oil properties as required by the full cost method of accounting. Under the full cost method, alldirect costs of property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. If net capitalized costs exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues based on hedge-adjusted period-end prices from the production of provedgas and oil reserves (the ceiling test) in a given country at the end of any quarterly period, then a permanent write-down of the assets must be recognized in that period.  We maintain business interruption insurance for offshore operations associated with our exploration and production business. We have placed our insurers on notice that we have suffered substantial property damage and businessinterruption loss related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Failure to realize the full value of our claims could adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, the increased level of hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico is likely tosignificantly increase the cost of business interruption insurance and could make it unavailable on commercially reasonable terms. Inability to insure our offshore Gulf of Mexico operations could adversely affect our results of operations. An inability to access financial markets could affect the execution of our business plan. Dominion and our Virginia Power and CNG subsidiariesrely on access to short-term money markets, longer-term capital markets and banks as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements and collateral requirements related to hedges of future gas and oil production not satisfied by the cashflows from our operations. Management believes that Dominion and our subsidiaries will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets based upon current credit ratings. However, certain disruptions outside of our control may increase our costof borrowing or restrict our ability to access one or more financial markets. Such disruptions could include an economic downturn, the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company or changes to our credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to accessfinancial markets may affect our ability to execute our business plan as scheduled.  Changing rating agency requirements could negatively affectour growth and business strategy. As of February 1, 2006, Dominions senior unsecured debt is rated BBB, stable outlook, by Standard & Poors Rating Group (Standard & Poors); Baa1, under review for potentialdowngrade, by Moodys Investors Services (Moodys); and BBB+, stable outlook, by Fitch Ratings Ltd. (Fitch). In order to maintain our current credit ratings in light of existing or future requirements, we may find it necessary to takesteps or change our business plans in ways that may adversely affect our growth and earnings per share. A reduction in Dominions credit ratings or the credit ratings of our Virginia Power and CNG subsidiaries by Standard &Poors, Moodys or Fitch could increase our borrowing costs and adversely affect operating results and could require us to post additional collateral in connection with some of our trading and marketing activities.  Potential changes in accounting practices may adversely affect our financial results. We cannot predict the impact that future changes in accountingstandards or practices may have on public companies in general, the energy industry or our operations specifically. New accounting standards could be issued that could change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Thesechanges in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported earnings or could increase reported liabilities.  Failure to retain and attractkey executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on our operations. Implementation of our growth strategy is dependent on our ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees.Competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to retain and attract these employees could adversely affect our business and future financial condition.   "
