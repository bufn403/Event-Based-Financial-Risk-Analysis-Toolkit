Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to those set forth below. This discussion should be considered in conjunction with the discussion under the caption “Forward-Looking Information” preceding Part I, the information set forth under Item 1, “Business” and with the discussion of the business included in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” These risks comprise the material risks of which we are aware. If any of the events or developments described below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or in any documents that we subsequently file publicly were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Risks Relating to Our BusinessMacroeconomic fluctuations may harm our business, results of operations and stock price. Our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks, including credit market conditions, trade policies, levels of consumer and business confidence, commodity prices and availability, inflationary pressures, exchange rates, levels of government spending and deficits, political conditions, and other challenges that could affect the global economy, including the ongoing conflict in the Middle East as well as impacts associated with any economic sanctions imposed against Russia, in response to their invasion of the Ukraine. These economic and geopolitical conditions could affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways. Such conditions could have an adverse impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions and on our ability to fund our operations, grow through operations or refinance maturing debt balances at economically favorable interest rates. In addition, restrictions on credit availability could adversely affect the ability of our customers to obtain financing for significant purchases and could result in decreases in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments. Similarly, credit restrictions may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. See “Specific Risks Related to Our Business Segments.”The prices of our components and raw materials could fluctuate dramatically, which may adversely affect our profitability.The costs of certain components and raw materials that are critical to our profitability can be volatile, which can have a significant impact on our profitability. The costs in our business segments are affected by fluctuations in the price of metals such as steel and copper as well as other raw materials such as resin and electronic components. We have seen a period of sustained price increases for components and raw materials that may continue into the future as demand increases and supply may remain constrained, notably in our A&E segment, which has resulted in, and may continue to result in, increased costs for us. While we have taken actions aimed at securing an adequate supply of raw materials at prices which are favorable to us, if the prices of critical components and raw materials increase or we are unable to pass increased costs of components and raw materials to customers, our operating profit could be adversely affected. The COVID-19 pandemic had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance, as well as on the operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve. Our operations have generally stabilized since the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic and in May 2023, the World Health Organization declared an end to COVID-19 as a public health emergency. However, a resurgence of COVID-19, or other public health emergencies, could result in unpredictable responses by health authorities around the world which could negatively impact our global operations, customers and suppliers. Any future pandemics or public health emergencies could result in disruptions to global supply chains, delays in supplier deliveries, higher raw material prices, delays in deliveries to customers, travel restrictions, site access and quarantine restrictions, and employee absences. The extent to which public health emergencies could impact our operations and financial performance is highly uncertain and would depend on future developments, including the duration of any such public health emergency, potential actions taken by governmental authorities, and how quickly economic conditions stabilize.   Our ability to source components and raw materials from our suppliers could be disrupted or delayed in our supply chain, which could adversely affect our results of operations.Our operations require significant amounts of necessary components and raw materials. We deploy a continuous, company-wide process to source our components and raw materials from fewer suppliers, and to obtain parts from suppliers in low-cost countries where possible. Due to a variety of factors, our A&E business has been experiencing, and may continue to experience, supply chain disruptions from an insufficient availability of certain components and raw materials. If we are unable to timely source these components or raw materials, our operations may be disrupted, or we could experience a delay or temporary stoppage in certain of our manufacturing operations. We believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Nonetheless, 10reduced availability or interruption in supplies, whether resulting from significant changes in demand; more stringent regulatory requirements; supplier financial condition; increases in duties and tariff costs; disruptions in transportation; an outbreak of a severe public health pandemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; severe weather; and the occurrence or threat of wars, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Demand for our products is variable and subject to factors beyond our control, which could result in unanticipated events significantly impacting our results of operations.A substantial portion of our sales is concentrated in industries that are cyclical in nature or subject to market conditions which may cause customer demand for our products to be volatile. Reductions in demand by these industries would reduce the sales and profitability of the affected business segments.•In our Aerospace & Electronics segment, a significant decline in demand for air travel, or a decline in airline profitability generally, could result in reduced orders for aircraft and could also cause airlines to reduce their purchases of repair parts from our businesses. In addition, our Aerospace & Electronics segment could be impacted to the extent that our major aircraft manufacturing customers encounter problems which impact their production rates and, correspondingly, reduce purchases of our products, or if pricing pressure from aircraft customers caused the manufacturers to press their suppliers to lower prices and/or extend payment terms; in addition, demand for military and defense products is dependent upon government spending in certain areas which can vary year to year.•Our Process Flow Technologies segment is dependent on global economic conditions, customer capital spending and commodity prices. Deterioration in any of these economic factors could result in sales and profits falling below our current outlook.•In our Engineered Materials segment, sales and profits could be affected by declines in demand for RVs, building materials or truck trailers; results could also be impacted by unforeseen changes in capacity or price increases related to certain raw materials, in particular, resin. We compete with other manufacturing businesses for highly qualified employees in the countries in which we operate, and we may not be able to retain our personnel or hire and retain additional personnel needed for us to sustain and grow our business as planned.Our business segments and corporate offices are dependent upon highly qualified personnel, and we generally are dependent upon the continued efforts of key management employees. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us or increase labor costs, including high employment levels, federal unemployment subsidies and other government regulations. We have recently observed an increasingly competitive labor market which has and could continue to result in higher compensation costs. While we believe we have a robust intellectual capital process, we may have difficulty retaining key personnel or locating and hiring additional qualified personnel. The loss of the services of any of such personnel or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms could impair our ability to successfully sustain and grow our business, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reputation.We are required to comply with various import and export control laws, which may affect transactions with certain customers, particularly in our Aerospace & Electronics and Process Flow Technologies segments, as discussed more fully under “Specific Risks Relating to Our Business Segments.” In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions, and other trade-related regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies, and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. A failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of associated contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting. For example, compliance with regulations related to the sourcing of conflict-free minerals mined from the democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries could limit the pool of suppliers who can provide conflict-free minerals to us, and as a result, may cause us to incur additional expenses and may create challenges for us to obtain conflict-free minerals at competitive prices. In addition, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper advantage. We are also subject to the anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions. Failure to comply with any of these and similar regulations could result in civil and criminal liability, monetary and non-monetary penalties, fines, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to export products and services, and damage to our reputation.11Information systems and technology networks failures and breaches in data security, personally identifiable and other information, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such information, or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such information, could adversely affect us.We are dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and, in the normal course of our business, we collect and retain certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customers, stockholders and employees. The legal, regulatory and contractual environment surrounding information security and privacy is constantly evolving and companies that collect and retain such information are under increasing attack by cyber-criminals around the world. A theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of customer, vendor, employee or our proprietary data by cybercrime or otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in costs, fines, litigation or regulatory action against us. Security breaches can create system disruptions and shutdowns that could result in disruptions to our operations. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, new vulnerabilities or other developments will not compromise or breach the security solutions protecting our information technology, networks and systems. A cyber-attack on our information systems technology or those of our partners, vendors, suppliers could adversely affect our ability to process orders, maintain proper levels of inventory, collect accounts receivable and pay expenses; all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Failure to effectively prevent, detect and recover from security breaches, including attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers; viruses; breaches due to employee error or actions; or other disruptions could seriously harm our operations as well as the operations of our customers and suppliers. Such serious harm can involve, among other things, misuse of our assets, business disruptions, loss of data, unauthorized access to trade secrets and confidential business information, unauthorized access to personal information, legal claims or proceedings, reporting errors, processing inefficiencies, negative media attention, reputational harm, loss of sales, remediation and increased insurance costs, and interference with regulatory compliance. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience some of these types of cybersecurity threats and incidents, which could be material in the future.We conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the U.S. and face risks inherent in non-domestic operations.Net sales by destination outside the U.S. were 39.6% of our consolidated amounts in 2023. We expect that non-U.S. sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. In addition, our operations outside the U.S. are subject to the risks associated with conducting business internationally, including, but not limited to:•economic and political instability, including the risk of geopolitical conflict or territorial incursions, in the countries and regions in which we operate;•the risks of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the euro and the British pound, could adversely affect our reported results, primarily in our Process Flow Technologies segment, as amounts earned in other countries are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes; and•changes in the U.S. government's approach to trade policy, including in some cases renegotiating and terminating certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the U.S. economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.•The COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance, as well as on the operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve. Our operations have substantially recovered since the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic and in May 2023, the World Health Organization declared an end to COVID-19 as a public health emergency. However, a resurgence of COVID-19, or other public health emergencies, could result in unpredictable responses by health authorities around the world which could negatively impact our global operations, customers and suppliers. Any future pandemics or public health emergencies could result in disruptions to global supply chains, delays in supplier deliveries, higher raw material prices, delays in deliveries to customers, travel restrictions, site access and quarantine restrictions, and employee absences.Our business could be harmed if we are unable to protect our intellectual property.We rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, trademarks, copyrights and confidentiality procedures to protect our products and technology. Existing trade secret, patent, trademark and copyright laws offer only limited protection. Our patents could be invalidated or circumvented. In addition, others may develop substantially equivalent, or superseding 12proprietary technology, or competitors may offer equivalent non-infringing products in competition with our products, thereby substantially reducing the value of our proprietary rights. The laws of some foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. We cannot assure that the steps we take to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology. We could incur significant and/or unexpected costs in our efforts to successfully avoid, manage, defend and litigate intellectual property matters. Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may be unable to identify or to complete acquisitions, or to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire.We have evaluated, and expect to continue to evaluate, a wide array of potential acquisition transactions. Our acquisition program attempts to address the potential risks inherent in assessing the value, strengths, weaknesses, contingent or other liabilities, systems of internal control and profitability of acquisition candidates, as well as other challenges such as retaining the employees and integrating the operations of the businesses we acquire. Integrating acquired operations involves significant risks and uncertainties, including:•Maintenance of uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures;•Unplanned expenses associated with the integration efforts;•Inability to achieve planned facility repositioning savings or related efficiencies from recent and ongoing investments; and•Unidentified issues not discovered in the due diligence process, including legal contingencies.There can be no assurance that suitable acquisition opportunities will be available in the future, that we will continue to acquire businesses or that any business acquired will be integrated successfully or prove profitable, which could adversely impact our growth rate. Our ability to achieve our growth goals depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire, finance and integrate companies and businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated cost savings.Net periodic pension cost and pension contributions associated with our retirement benefit plans may fluctuate significantly depending upon changes in actuarial assumptions and future market performance of plan assets.Total net periodic pension benefit and pension contributions were $11.2 million and $18.1 million, respectively in 2023. The costs of our defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon various factors, including rates of return on investment assets, discount rates for future payment obligations, and expected mortality, among other things. In addition, funding requirements for benefit obligations of our pension plans are subject to legislative and other government regulatory actions. Variances in related estimates could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our future results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by intangible asset impairment charges.As of December 31, 2023, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of $835.6 million, which represented approximately 36% of our total assets. Our goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and is also tested whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Any excess goodwill resulting from the impairment test must be written off in the period of determination. Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are generally amortized over the useful life of such assets. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire or make an investment in a business that will require us to record goodwill based on the purchase price and the value of the acquired assets. We may subsequently experience unforeseen issues with such business that adversely affect the anticipated returns of the business or value of the intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets for such business. Future determinations of significant write-offs of goodwill or intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or any accelerated amortization of other intangible assets could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities, costs, litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reputation.Our operations are subject to extensive environmental and health and safety laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water and establish standards for the generation, treatment, use, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. We must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the U.S. and abroad in connection with our operations. The costs of compliance with these regulations results in ongoing costs that may increase over time. Failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal liability, substantial monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current 13waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may be unable to improve productivity, reduce costs and align manufacturing capacity with customer demand.We are committed to continuous productivity improvement, and we continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce costs, simplify or improve global processes, and increase the reliability of order fulfillment and satisfaction of customer needs. In order to operate more efficiently and control costs, from time to time we execute restructuring activities, which include workforce reductions and facility consolidations.We could face potential product liability or warranty claims, we may not accurately estimate costs related to such claims, and we may not have sufficient insurance coverage available to cover such claims.Our products are used in a wide variety of commercial applications and certain residential applications, including, in many cases, in severe service or mission critical applications. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability or other claims in the event our products are alleged to be defective or that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property. We may in the future incur liability if product liability lawsuits against us are successful. Moreover, any such lawsuits, whether or not successful, could result in adverse publicity to us, which could cause our sales to decline.In addition, consistent with industry practice, we provide warranties on many of our products, and we may experience costs of warranty or breach of contract claims if our products have defects in manufacture or design or they do not meet contractual specifications. We estimate our future warranty costs based on historical trends and product sales, but we may fail to accurately estimate those costs and thereby fail to establish adequate warranty reserves for them.While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain liability claims, that insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all claims that may arise, or we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liabilities not covered by insurance or that exceed our established reserves could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We may be unable to successfully develop and introduce new products, which would limit our ability to grow and maintain our competitive position and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.Our growth depends, in part, on continued sales of existing products, as well as the successful development and introduction of new products or technologies, which face the uncertainty of customer acceptance and reaction from competitors. Any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our not being the first to market, which could compromise our competitive position. Further, the development and introduction of new products may require us to make investments in specialized personnel and capital equipment, increase marketing efforts and reallocate resources away from other uses. We also may need to modify our systems and strategy in light of new products that we develop. If we are unable to develop and introduce new products in a cost-effective manner or otherwise manage effectively the operations related to new products, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.We face significant competition which may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in the future.While we are a principal competitor in most of our markets, all of our markets are highly competitive. The competitors in many of our business segments can be expected in the future to improve technologies, reduce costs and develop and introduce new products. The ability of our business segments to achieve similar advances will be important to our competitive positions. Competitive pressures, including those discussed above, could cause one or more of our business segments to lose market share or could result in significant price erosion, either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Fluctuations in interest rates could affect our financial results.Our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates. As a result, an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $249.3 million of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. As of December 31, 2023, a hypothetical 1% increase in prevailing interest rates would increase our 2023 interest expense by approximately $2.5 million.14Additional tax expense or exposures could affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various international jurisdictions. Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be affected by changes to tax laws, regulations, accounting principles and judicial rulings, the geographic mix of our earnings, the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns. By way of example, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) has been coordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies, including the implementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15%. While various countries have implemented legislation as of January 1, 2024, and we currently do not expect a resulting material change to our tax liabilities in the near term as additional jurisdictions enact such legislation, we do not expect our effective tax rate and cash tax payments to significantly increase in future years.If our internal controls are found to be ineffective, our financial results or our stock price may be adversely affected.We believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place for future periods, including processes related to newly acquired businesses; however, increased risk of internal control breakdowns generally exists in any business environment that is decentralized such as ours. In addition, if our internal control over financial reporting is found to be ineffective, investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which may adversely affect our stock price.Specific Risks Relating to Our Reportable SegmentsAerospace & ElectronicsOur Aerospace & Electronics segment sales are primarily affected by conditions in the commercial aerospace industry, which is cyclical in nature, and by changes in defense spending by the U.S. government.Commercial aircraft are procured primarily by airlines, and airline capital spending can be affected by a number of factors including credit availability and related cost, current and expected fuel prices, and current and forecast air traffic demand levels. Air traffic levels are affected by a different array of factors including general economic conditions and global corporate travel spending, although other non-economic events can also adversely impact airline traffic, including terrorism or pandemic health concerns, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Our commercial business is also affected by the market for business jets where demand is typically tied to corporate profitability levels, and the freight markets which are most heavily influenced by general economic conditions. Demand for our commercial aftermarket business is closely tied to total aircraft flight hours. Any decrease in demand for new aircraft or equipment, or use of existing aircraft and equipment, would result in decreased sales of our products and services. In addition, our commercial business could also be impacted to the extent that our major aircraft manufacturing customers encounter problems which impact their production rates and, correspondingly, reduce purchases of our products, or if pricing pressure from aircraft customers caused the manufacturers to press their suppliers to lower prices and/or extend payment terms.The defense portion of the segment’s business is dependent primarily on U.S. government spending, and to a lesser extent, foreign government spending, on the specific military platforms and programs where our business participates. Any reduction in appropriations for these platforms or programs could impact the performance of our business. Our sales to defense customers are also affected by the level of activity in military flight operations.We rely on certain subcontractors and suppliers to provide and produce raw materials, integrated components and sub-assemblies. The Aerospace and Defense industry is experiencing continued disruptions due to the lingering impacts of COVID-19 and related global supply chain constraints and labor instability. If one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors continue to experience delivery delays or other performance problems, we may be unable to meet commitments to our customers and our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may continue to be adversely impacted. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply. Any service disruption from one of these suppliers, either due to circumstances beyond the supplier's control, such as geopolitical developments, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs.We are required to comply with various export control laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies, and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, manufacturing practices and quality procedures, export control, employment practices, the accuracy of records and the recording of costs and information security requirements. A failure to comply with these requirements could result in suspension of these contracts, and suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting. Failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal liability, monetary and non-monetary penalties, fines, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to export products and services, and damage to our reputation.15Due to the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing commercial and military products to market, we cannot accurately predict the demand levels that will exist once a given new product is ready for market. In addition, if we are unable to develop and introduce new products in a cost-effective manner or otherwise effectively manage the introduction of new products and/or programs, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Demand for our products could also be adversely impacted by industry consolidation that could result in greater acceptance of competitors' products.Process Flow TechnologiesOur Process Flow Technologies segment competes in markets that are fragmented and highly competitive. The business competes against large, well-established global companies, as well as smaller regional and local companies. We compete based on our products’ quality, reliability and safety, our brand reputation, value-added technical expertise and customer support and consistent on-time delivery. Demand for our Process Flow Technologies products is heavily dependent on our customers’ level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures. Customer spending typically depends on general economic conditions, availability of credit, and expectations of future demand. Slowing global economic growth and volatility in commodity prices could both contribute to lower levels of customer spending, and project delays or cancellations.A portion of this segment’s business is subject to government contracting rules and regulations. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting, civil and criminal liability, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to export products and services, or damage to our reputation. At our foreign operations, results could also be adversely impacted by a weakening of local currencies against the U.S. dollar. Our Process Flow Technologies business has the greatest exposure to the euro, British pound and Canadian dollar, and lesser exposure to several other currencies.Engineered MaterialsOur Engineered Materials segment manufactures and sells fiberglass reinforced plastic (“FRP”) panels and coils, primarily for use in the manufacturing of RVs, trucks, and trailers, with additional applications in commercial and industrial building construction. Demand in these end markets is dependent on general economic conditions, credit availability, and consumer and corporate spending levels. A decline in demand in any of these end markets, including a significant change in RV industry capacity; a loss of market share to alternative materials such as, for example, non-reinforced plastic, PVC, tile, stainless steel, epoxy paint, wood, and aluminum; or customer pricing pressure would result in lower sales and profits for this business. Profitability could also be adversely affected by an increase in the price of resin or fiberglass if we are unable to pass the incremental costs on to our customers. Additional risks include the loss of a principal supplier"

 Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to those set forth below. Thisdiscussion should be considered in conjunction with the discussion under the caption Forward-Looking Information preceding Part I, the information set forth under Item 1, Business and with the discussion of the businessincluded in Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. These risks comprise the material risks of which we are aware. If any of the events or developments describedbelow or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or in any documents that we subsequently file publicly were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Risks Relating to Our Business  Macroeconomic fluctuations may harm ourbusiness, results of operations and stock price.  Our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by changesin global economic conditions and geopolitical risks, including credit market conditions, trade policies, levels of consumer and business confidence, commodity prices and availability, inflationary pressures, exchange rates, levels of governmentspending and deficits, political conditions, and other challenges that could affect the global economy including impacts associated with any economic sanctions imposed against Russia, including any territory within the Ukraine that Russia hasoccupied, in response to their invasion of the Ukraine. These economic and geopolitical conditions could affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways. Such conditions could have an adverse impact on our flexibility to react to changingeconomic and business conditions and on our ability to fund our operations, grow through operations or refinance maturing debt balances at economically favorable interest rates. In addition, restrictions on credit availability could adversely affectthe ability of our customers to obtain financing for significant purchases and could result in decreases in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments. Similarly, creditrestrictions may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. See Specific Risks Related to Our Business Segments. Our ability to source components and raw materials from our suppliers could be disrupted or delayed in our supply chain which could adversely affect ourresults of operations.  Our operations require significant amounts of necessary components and raw materials. We deploy a continuous, company-wideprocess to source our components and raw materials from fewer suppliers, and to obtain parts from suppliers in low-cost countries where possible. Due to a variety of global factors, our business has been experiencing, and may continue to experience,supply chain disruptions from an insufficient availability of certain components and raw materials and substantial freight delays in obtaining them. If we are unable to timely source these components or raw materials, our operations may bedisrupted, or we could experience a delay or temporary stoppage in certain of our manufacturing operations. We believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costsof alternative practices. Nonetheless, reduced availability or interruption in supplies, whether resulting from more stringent regulatory requirements; supplier financial condition; increases in duties and tariff costs; disruptions intransportation; an outbreak of a severe public health pandemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; severe weather; the occurrence or threat of wars, including Russias invasion of Ukraine or other conflicts, could have an adverse effect on ourfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  The prices of our components and raw materials could fluctuate dramatically, which may adverselyaffect our profitability.  The costs of certain components and raw materials that are critical to our profitability can be volatile which can have asignificant impact on our profitability. The costs in our business segments are affected by fluctuations in the price of metals such as steel and copper as well as other raw materials such as resin, and electronic components. We have seen a periodof sustained price increases for components and raw materials that may continue into the future as demand increases and supply may remain constrained, which has resulted in, and may continue to result in, increased costs for us. While we have takenactions aimed at securing an adequate supply of raw materials at prices which are favorable to us, if the prices of critical components and raw materials continue to increase or we are unable to pass increased costs of components and raw materialsto customers, our operating profit could be adversely affected.   13 Table of ContentsThe COVID-19 pandemic had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance, aswell as on the operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to present business challenges, and we continue to experience impacts related to COVID-19,primarily in disruptions in global supply chains, delays in supplier deliveries, higher raw material prices, delays in deliveries to customers, travel restrictions, site access and quarantine restrictions, and employee absences. Because theseverity, magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its continuing economic consequences remain uncertain and rapidly changing, it is difficult to predict the extent of the pandemics impact on our operations and financialperformance.  Information systems and technology networks failures and breaches in data security, personally identifiable and other information,non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such information, or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such information, could adversely affect us. We are dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and, in the normalcourse of our business, we collect and retain certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customers, stockholders and employees. The legal, regulatory and contractual environment surrounding information securityand privacy is constantly evolving and companies that collect and retain such information are under increasing attack by cyber-criminals around the world. A theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of customer, vendor, employee or our proprietary databy cybercrime or otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could adversely impact our reputation and could result incosts, fines, litigation or regulatory action against us. Security breaches can create system disruptions and shutdowns that could result in disruptions to our operations. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, newvulnerabilities or other developments will not compromise or breach the security solutions protecting our information technology, networks and systems. A cyber-attack on our information systems technology or those of our partners, vendors, supplierscould adversely affect our ability to process orders, maintain proper levels of inventory, collect accounts receivable and pay expenses; all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Failure to effectively prevent, detect and recover from security breaches, including attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers; viruses; breaches due to employee error or actions; or other disruptions could seriously harm ouroperations as well as the operations of our customers and suppliers. Such serious harm can involve, among other things, misuse of our assets, business disruptions, loss of data, unauthorized access to trade secrets and confidential businessinformation, unauthorized access to personal information, legal claims or proceedings, reporting errors, processing inefficiencies, negative media attention, reputational harm, loss of sales, remediation and increased insurance costs, andinterference with regulatory compliance. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience some of these types of cybersecurity threats and incidents, which could be material in the future. Demand for our products is variable and subject to factors beyond our control, which could result in unanticipated events significantly impacting our results ofoperations.  A substantial portion of our sales is concentrated in industries that are cyclical in nature or subject to market conditions which may causecustomer demand for our products to be volatile. Reductions in demand by these industries would reduce the sales and profitability of the affected business segments.      In our Aerospace & Electronics segment, a significant decline in demand for air travel, or a decline in airlineprofitability generally, could result in reduced orders for aircraft and could also cause airlines to reduce their purchases of repair parts from our businesses. In addition, our Aerospace & Electronics segment could be impacted to theextent that our major aircraft manufacturing customers encounter problems which impact their production rates and, correspondingly, reduce purchases of our products (for example, the grounding of the 737 MAX and associated suspension of 737 MAXproduction announced by Boeing in December 2019 reduced our sales and operating profit in 2020), or if pricing pressure from aircraft customers caused the manufacturers to press their suppliers to lower prices and/or extend payment terms; inaddition, demand for military and defense products is dependent upon government spending in certain areas which can vary year to year.   14 Table of Contents   Our Process Flow Technologies segment is dependent on global economic conditions, customer capital spending and commodityprices. Deterioration in any of these economic factors could result in sales and profits falling below our current outlook.      In our Engineered Materials segment, sales and profits could be affected by declines in demand for RVs, building materialsor truck trailers; results could also be impacted by unforeseen changes in capacity or price increases related to certain raw materials, in particular, resin. Our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial condition, resultsof operations, cash flows and reputation.  We are required to comply with various import and export control laws, which may affect our transactions withcertain customers, particularly in our Aerospace & Electronics and Process Flow Technologies segments, as discussed more fully under Specific Risks Relating to Our Business Segments. In certain circumstances, export control andeconomic sanctions, and other trade-related regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies, and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. A failureto comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting. For example, compliance with regulations related to the sourcing of conflict-free mineralsmined from the democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries could limit the pool of suppliers who can provide conflict-free minerals to us, and as a result, may cause us to incur additional expenses and may create challenges for us to obtainconflict-free minerals at competitive prices. In addition, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtainingor retaining business, or securing any improper advantage. We are also subject to the anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions. Failure to comply with any of these and similar regulations could result in civil and criminal liability, monetary andnon-monetary penalties, fines, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to export products and services, and damage to our reputation.  Wecompete with other manufacturing businesses for highly qualified employees in the countries in which we operate, and we may not be able to retain our personnel or hire and retain additional personnel needed for us to sustain and grow our business asplanned.  Our business segments and corporate offices are dependent upon highly qualified personnel, and we generally are dependent upon the continuedefforts of key management employees. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us or increase labor costs, including high employment levels, federal unemployment subsidies, including enhanced or expanded unemploymentbenefits offered in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and other government regulations. We have recently observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market which has, and could continue to result in higher compensationcosts. While we believe we have a robust intellectual capital process, we may have difficulty retaining key personnel or locating and hiring additional qualified personnel. The loss of the services of any of such personnel or our failure to attractand retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms could impair our ability to successfully sustain and grow our business, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the U.S. and face risks inherent in non-domestic operations. Net sales by destination outside the U.S. were 42.2% of our combined amounts in 2022. We expect that non-U.S. sales will continue to account for a significant portionof our revenues for the foreseeable future. In addition, our operations outside the U.S. are subject to the risks associated with conducting business internationally, including, but not limited to:     economic and political instability, including the risk of geopolitical conflict or territorial incursions, in the countriesand regions in which we operate;   15 Table of Contents   the risks of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the euro, the British pound and the Japanese yen,could adversely affect our reported results, primarily in our Process Flow Technologies, as amounts earned in other countries are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes; and     changes in the U.S. governments approach to trade policy, including in some cases renegotiating and terminatingcertain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential toadversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the U.S. economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.     The COVID-19 pandemic had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance, as wellas on the operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to present business challenges, and we continue to experience impacts related to COVID-19, primarilyin disruptions in global supply chains, delays in supplier deliveries, higher raw material prices, delays in deliveries to customers, travel restrictions, site access and quarantine restrictions, and employee absences. Because the severity,magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its continuing economic consequences remain uncertain and rapidly changing, it is difficult to predict the extent of the pandemics impact on our operations and financial performance. Net periodic pension (benefit) cost and pension contributions associated with our retirement benefit plans may fluctuate significantlydepending upon changes in actuarial assumptions and future market performance of plan assets.  Total net periodic pension benefit and pension contributionswere $2.3 million and $17.8 million, respectively in 2022. The costs of our defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon various factors, including rates of return on investment assets, discount rates for future payment obligations, and expectedmortality, among other things. In addition, funding requirements for benefit obligations of our pension plans are subject to legislative and other government regulatory actions. Variances in related estimates could have an adverse effect on ourfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Our business could be harmed if we are unable to protect our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, trademarks, copyrights and confidentiality procedures to protect our products and technology. Existing trade secret,patent, trademark and copyright laws offer only limited protection. Our patents could be invalidated or circumvented. In addition, others may develop substantially equivalent, or superseding proprietary technology, or competitors may offerequivalent non-infringing products in competition with our products, thereby substantially reducing the value of our proprietary rights. The laws of some foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold may not protect ourproducts or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. We cannot assure that the steps we take to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology. We could incursignificant and/or unexpected costs in our efforts to successfully avoid, manage, defend and litigate intellectual property matters. Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, resultsof operations and cash flows.  We may be unable to identify or to complete acquisitions, or to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire. We have evaluated, and expect to continue to evaluate, a wide array of potential acquisition transactions. Our acquisition program attempts to address the potentialrisks inherent in assessing the value, strengths, weaknesses, contingent or other liabilities, systems of internal control and potential profitability of acquisition candidates, as well as other challenges such as retaining the employees andintegrating the operations of the businesses we acquire. Integrating acquired operations involves significant risks and uncertainties, including:      Maintenance of uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures;   16 Table of Contents   Unplanned expenses associated with the integration efforts;     Inability to achieve planned facility repositioning savings or related efficiencies from recent and ongoing investments;and      Unidentified issues not discovered in the due diligence process, including legal contingencies. There can be no assurance that suitable acquisition opportunities will be available in the future, that we will continue to acquire businesses or that any businessacquired will be integrated successfully or prove profitable, which could adversely impact our growth rate. Our ability to achieve our growth goals depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire, finance and integratecompanies and businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated cost savings.  Our future results of operations and financial condition could beadversely impacted by intangible asset impairment charges.  As of December 31, 2022, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulatedamortization, of $762.6 million, which represented approximately 34% of our total assets. Our goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and is also tested whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired.Any excess goodwill resulting from the impairment test must be written off in the period of determination. Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are generally amortized over the useful life of such assets. In addition, from time to time, we mayacquire or make an investment in a business that will require us to record goodwill based on the purchase price and the value of the acquired assets. We may subsequently experience unforeseen issues with such business that adversely affect theanticipated returns of the business or value of the intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets for such business. Future determinations of significant write-offs of goodwill orintangible assets as a result of an impairment test or any accelerated amortization of other intangible assets could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities, costs, litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition, resultsof operations, cash flows and reputation.  Our operations are subject to extensive environmental and health and safety laws and regulations in thejurisdictions in which they operate, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water and establish standards for the generation, treatment, use, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. We must alsocomply with various health and safety regulations in the U.S. and abroad in connection with our operations. The costs of compliance with these regulations results in ongoing costs that may increase over time. Failure to comply with any of these lawscould result in civil and criminal liability, substantial monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damageassociated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may be unable to improve productivity, reduce costs and align manufacturing capacity with customer demand. We are committed to continuous productivity improvement, and we continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce costs, simplify or improve global processes, and increasethe reliability of order fulfillment and satisfaction of customer needs. In order to operate more efficiently and control costs, from time to time we execute restructuring activities, which include workforce reductions and facility consolidations.For example, we recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $32.1 million for the 2020 repositioning program related to actions to reduce our global workforce in response to the adverse economic impact of COVID-19. At the end of 2022, we took modestcost reduction actions in response to continued global economic uncertainty. While these are proactive actions to increase our productivity and operating effectiveness, our inability to adequately respond to potential declines in global demand forour products and services and properly align our cost base could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.   17 Table of ContentsWe could face potential product liability or warranty claims, we may not accurately estimate costs related tosuch claims, and we may not have sufficient insurance coverage available to cover such claims.  Our products are used in a wide variety of commercialapplications and certain residential applications, including, in many cases, in severe service or mission critical applications. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability or other claims in the event our products are allegedto be defective or that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property. We may in the future incur liability if product liability lawsuits against us are successful. Moreover, any such lawsuits, whether or notsuccessful, could result in adverse publicity to us, which could cause our sales to decline.  In addition, consistent with industry practice, we provide warrantieson many of our products and we may experience costs of warranty or breach of contract claims if our products have defects in manufacture or design or they do not meet contractual specifications. We estimate our future warranty costs based onhistorical trends and product sales, but we may fail to accurately estimate those costs and thereby fail to establish adequate warranty reserves for them.  While wemaintain insurance coverage with respect to certain liability claims, that insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all claims that may arise or we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost.Any liabilities not covered by insurance or that exceed our established reserves could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may be unable to successfully develop and introduce new products, which would limit our ability to grow and maintain our competitive position and adverselyaffect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.  Our growth depends, in part, on continued sales of existing products, as well as thesuccessful development and introduction of new products or technologies, which face the uncertainty of customer acceptance and reaction from competitors. Any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our not being the firstto market, which could compromise our competitive position. Further, the development and introduction of new products may require us to make investments in specialized personnel and capital equipment, increase marketing efforts and reallocateresources away from other uses. We also may need to modify our systems and strategy in light of new products that we develop. If we are unable to develop and introduce new products in a cost-effective manner or otherwise manage effectively theoperations related to new products, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.  We face significantcompetition which may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in the future.  While we are a principal competitor inmost of our markets, all of our markets are highly competitive. The competitors in many of our business segments can be expected in the future to improve technologies, reduce costs and develop and introduce new products. The ability of our businesssegments to achieve similar advances will be important to our competitive positions. Competitive pressures, including those discussed above, could cause one or more of our business segments to lose market share or could result in significant priceerosion, either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Fluctuations in interest rates couldaffect our financial results.  A portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates. As aresult, an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $400.0 million of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. As ofDecember 31, 2022, a hypothetical 1% increase in prevailing interest rates would increase our 2022 interest expense by approximately $4.0 million.   18 Table of ContentsAdditional tax expense or exposures could affect our financial condition, results of operations and cashflows.  We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various international jurisdictions. Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flowcould be affected by changes to any or all of the following: tax laws, regulations, accounting principles and judicial rulings, the geographic mix of our earnings, the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the results of auditsand examinations of previously filed tax returns.  If our internal controls are found to be ineffective, our financial results or our stock price may beadversely affected.  We believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place for future periods, including processes related tonewly acquired businesses; however, increased risk of internal control breakdowns generally exists in any business environment that is decentralized such as ours. In addition, if our internal control over financial reporting is found to beineffective, investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which may adversely affect our stock price.  Specific Risks Relatingto Our Reportable Segments  Aerospace & Electronics Our Aerospace & Electronics segment sales are primarily affected by conditions in the commercial aerospace industry which is cyclical in nature, and by changesin defense spending by the U.S. government.  Commercial aircraft are procured primarily by airlines, and airline capital spending can be affected by a number offactors including credit availability and related cost, current and expected fuel prices, and current and forecast air traffic demand levels. Air traffic levels are affected by a different array of factors including general economic conditions andglobal corporate travel spending, although other non-economic events can also adversely impact airline traffic, including terrorism or pandemic health concerns, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Our commercial business is also affected by the marketfor business jets where demand is typically tied to corporate profitability levels, and the freight markets which are most heavily influenced by general economic conditions. Demand for our commercial aftermarket business is closely tied to totalaircraft flight hours. Any decrease in demand for new aircraft or equipment, or use of existing aircraft and equipment, would likely result in decreased sales of our products and services. In addition, our commercial business could also be impactedto the extent that our major aircraft manufacturing customers encounter problems which impact their production rates and, correspondingly, reduce purchases of our products (for example, the grounding of the 737 MAX and associated suspension of 737MAX production announced by Boeing in December 2019 reduced our sales and operating profit in 2020), or if pricing pressure from aircraft customers caused the manufacturers to press their suppliers to lower prices and/or extend payment terms. The defense portion of the segments business is dependent primarily on U.S. government spending, and to a lesser extent, foreign government spending, on thespecific military platforms and programs where our business participates. Any reduction in appropriations for these platforms or programs could impact the performance of our business. Our sales to defense customers are also affected by the level ofactivity in military flight operations.  We rely on certain subcontractors and suppliers to provide and produce raw materials, integrated components andsub-assemblies. The Aerospace and Defense industry is experiencing continued disruptions due to the lingering impacts of COVID-19, global supply chain constraints, and labor instability. If one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors continue toexperience delivery delays or other performance problems, we may be unable to meet commitments to our customers and our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may continue to be adversely impacted. In some instances, we depend upona single source of supply. Any service disruption from one of these suppliers, either due to circumstances beyond the suppliers control, such as geopolitical developments, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitmentsto our customers or increase our operating costs.  We are required to comply with various export control laws, which may affect our transactions with certaincustomers. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies, and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exportingthe controlled item. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts,   19 Table of Contentsincluding requirements related to procurement integrity, manufacturing practices and quality procedures, export control, employment practices, the accuracy of records and the recording of costsand information security requirements. A failure to comply with these requirements could result in suspension of these contracts, and suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting. Failure to comply with any of theseregulations could result in civil and criminal liability, monetary and non-monetary penalties, fines, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to export products and services, and damage to our reputation. Due to the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing commercial and military products to market, we cannot accurately predict the demand levels thatwill exist once a given new product is ready for market. In addition, if we are unable to develop and introduce new products in a cost-effective manner or otherwise effectively manage the introduction of new products and/or programs, our results ofoperations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Demand for our products could also be adversely impacted by industry consolidation that could result in greater acceptance of competitors products. Process Flow Technologies  Our Process Flow Technologies segmentcompetes in markets that are fragmented and highly competitive. The business competes against large, well established global companies, as well as smaller regional and local companies. We compete based on our products quality, reliability andsafety, our brand reputation, value-added technical expertise and customer support and consistent on-time delivery.  Demand for our Process Flow Technologiesproducts is heavily dependent on our customers level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures. Customer spending typically depends on general economic conditions, availability of credit, and expectations of future demand.Slowing global economic growth, volatility in commodity prices, including the price of oil could all contribute to lower levels of customer spending, and project delays or cancellations. A portion of this segments business is subject to government contracting rules and regulations. Failure to comply with these requirements could result insuspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting, civil and criminal liability, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to export products and services, or damage to ourreputation. At our foreign operations, results could also be adversely impacted by a weakening of local currencies against the U.S. dollar. Our Process Flow Technologies business has the greatest exposure to the euro, British pound and Canadiandollar, and lesser exposure to several other currencies.  Engineered Materials Our Engineered Materials segment manufactures and sells fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP) panels and coils, primarily for use in the manufacturing of RVs,trucks, and trailers, with additional applications in commercial and industrial building construction. Demand in these end markets is dependent on general economic conditions, credit availability, and consumer and corporate spending levels. Adecline in demand in any of these end markets, including a significant change in RV industry capacity; a loss of market share to alternative materials such as, for example, non-reinforced plastic, PVC, tile, stainless steel, epoxy paint, wood, andaluminum; or customer pricing pressure would result in lower sales and profits for this business. Profitability could also be adversely affected by an increase in the price of resin or fiberglass if we are unable to pass the incremental costs on toour customers. Additional risks include the loss of a principal supplier.  Risks Related to the Spin-Off Crane Company may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the spin-off, and the spin-off may adversely affect the Companys business. Crane Company may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the spin-off, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur atall. The spin-off is expected to provide the following benefits, among others:      Enhanced ability to attract a stockholder base aligned with Crane Companys clear value proposition.     Tailored capital allocation strategies aligned with Crane Companys distinct business strategies and industry specificdynamics.      Deeper operational focus, accountability and flexibility to meet customer requirements.     Increased operating and financial flexibility to pursue inorganic growth opportunities.     Enhanced ability to pursue accretive M&A opportunities, with the benefit of an independent equity currency reflectiveof the strength of each company.  Crane Company may not achieve these and other anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons, including, amongothers: (i) the spin-off will require significant amounts of managements time and effort, which may divert managements attention from operating and growing Crane Companys business, (ii) following the spin-off, Crane Companysstock price may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other events particular to one or more of Crane Companys products than if it were still a part of Crane and (iii) following the spin-off, Crane Companys operational andfinancial profile will change such that Crane Companys diversification of revenue sources will diminish, and Crane Companys results of operations, cash flows, working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increasedvolatility than prior to the spin-off. Additionally, Crane Company may experience unanticipated competitive developments, including changes in the conditions of the markets of the Companys A&E, PFT and Engineered Materials segments, andthe other businesses it will hold at the time of the spin-off, that could negate the expected benefits from the spin-off. If Crane Company does not realize some or all of the benefits expected to result from the spin-off, or if such benefits aredelayed, the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Crane Company could be adversely affected.   20 Table of ContentsCrane Company may incur material costs and expenses as a result of the spin-off. Crane Company may incur costs and expenses greater than those Crane Company currently expects to incur as a result of the spin-off. These increased costs and expensesmay arise from various factors, including financial reporting and costs associated with complying with federal securities laws (including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act). In addition, Crane Company expects to either maintain similar or haveincreased corporate and administrative costs and expenses to those Crane Company incurred while part of Crane, even though, following the spin-off, Crane Company will be a smaller, stand-alone company. We cannot assure you that these costs will notbe material to Crane Companys business.  If, following the spin-off, Crane Company is unable to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of theSarbanes-Oxley Act, or its internal control over financial reporting is not effective, it could have a material adverse effect on the Companys businesses and Crane Companys stock price may suffer. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws to do a comprehensive evaluation of its andits consolidated subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting. Our financial results previously were included within the consolidated results of Crane. However, Crane Company was not directly subject to the reporting and otherrequirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  As a result of the spin-off, CraneCompany will be directly subject to reporting and other obligations under the Exchange Act. Beginning with its second annual report on Form 10-K, Crane Company will be required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which will requireit to document and test its internal control procedures, its management will be required to assess and issue a report concerning its internal control over financial reporting and its independent auditors will be required to issue an opinion on CraneCompanys internal controls over financial reporting. These reporting and other obligations may place significant demands on our management and administrative and operational resources, including accounting systems and resources. To comply withthese requirements, we will need to establish our own systems, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures and hire additional accounting and finance staff. We expect to incur additional annual expensesfor the purpose of addressing these requirements, and those expenses may be significant. If we are unable to establish our financial and management controls, reporting systems, information technology systems and procedures in a timely and effectivefashion, our ability to comply with our financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies under the Exchange Act could be impaired. During periods it is required to assess the effectiveness of its internal controls, if Crane Companys management is unable to conclude that it has effectiveinternal controls over financial reporting or its independent public accounting firm is unwilling or unable to provide Crane Company with an unqualified report on the effectiveness of its internal controls, as required by Section 404 of theSarbanes-Oxley Act, Crane Company may not be able to report its financial information on a timely basis. As a result, investors may lose confidence in Crane Companys financial results, Crane Companys stock price may suffer and CraneCompany may be subject to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys businesses. The historical and pro forma financial information presented herein is not necessarily representative of the results that Crane Company would have achieved as aseparate, publicly traded company and therefore may not be a reliable indicator of its future results.  Due to Crane Companys larger operations,greater tangible assets, greater fair value and greater net sales, in each case, relative to Crane NXT, among other factors, Crane Company will be treated as the accounting spinnor and therefore will be the accountingsuccessor to Crane for accounting purposes, notwithstanding the legal form of the spin-off described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Therefore, following the spin-off, the historical consolidated financial statements of Crane willrepresent the historical financial statements of Crane Company and Crane NXT will be presented as discontinued operations. The historical information about the Company in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to the Companys businesses aspart of Crane. The Companys historical and pro forma financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Crane. Accordingly, the historical and proforma financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows that Crane Company would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company duringthe periods presented or those that Crane Company will achieve in the future.  For additional information about the past financial performance of CraneCompanys businesses and the basis of presentation of the historical consolidated financial statements of Crane, the supplemental historical combined financial statements of Crane Company, see Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Crane NXT, Co. may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that will be executed as part of the spin-off or Crane Company may fail to havenecessary systems and services in place when Crane NXT, Co. is no longer obligated to provide services under the various agreements.  Crane Company and CraneHoldings, Co. or Crane NXT, Co., as applicable, will enter into certain agreements, such as the separation and distribution agreement, a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement, an intellectual property  21 Table of Contentsmatters agreement and an employee matters agreement, and those other agreements discussed in greater detail in Item 13 Certain Relationships and Related PartyTransactionsAgreements with Crane Holdings, Co. / Crane NXT, Co. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which may provide for the performance by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time after the spin-off. IfCrane NXT, Co. is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, Crane Company could incur operational difficulties or losses. If Crane Company does not have in place its own systems and services, and does not have agreements with other providers of these services when the transitional or otheragreements terminate, or if Crane Company does not implement the new systems or replace Crane NXT, Co.s services successfully, Crane Company may not be able to operate its business effectively, which could disrupt its business and have amaterial adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. These systems and services may also be more expensive to install, implement and operate, or less efficient than the systems and services Crane NXT, Co. isexpected to provide during the transition period.  Potential indemnification liabilities to Crane NXT, Co. pursuant to the separation and distributionagreement could materially and adversely affect Crane Companys business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  The separation anddistribution agreement, among other things, will provide for indemnification obligations designed to make Crane Company financially responsible for certain liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities. If Crane Company is requiredto indemnify Crane NXT, Co. under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement, Crane Company may be subject to substantial liabilities. Crane Company may be subject to certain contingent liabilities of Crane NXT following the spin-off. After the spin-off, there is the possibility that certain liabilities of Crane NXT could become Crane Company obligations. For example, under the Code and the relatedrules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of Crane during a taxable period or portion of a taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the distribution is jointly and severally liable for the United States federal incometax liability of Crane for that taxable period. Consequently, if Crane NXT is unable to pay the consolidated United States federal income tax liability for a prior period, Crane Company could be required to pay the entire amount of such tax, whichcould be substantial and in excess of the amount that would be allocated to it under the tax matters agreement that Crane Company intends to enter into with Crane Holdings, Co., which will be renamed Crane NXT, Co. For a discussion ofthe tax matters agreement, see Item 13 Certain Relationships and Related Party TransactionsAgreements with Crane Holdings, Co. / Crane NXT, Co.Tax Matters Agreement of this Annual Report on Form 10-K; other provisions offederal law establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans, as well as other contingent liabilities.  Inconnection with Crane Companys spin-off from Crane, Crane NXT, Co. will indemnify Crane Company for certain liabilities. However, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure Crane Company against the full amountof such liabilities, or that Crane Companys ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future.  Crane NXT, Co. willagree to indemnify Crane Company for certain pre-spin-off liabilities as discussed further in Item 13 Certain Relationships and Related Party TransactionsAgreements with Crane Holdings, Co. / Crane NXT, Co. of this Annual Report onForm 10-K. However, third parties could also seek to hold Crane Company responsible for liabilities that Crane NXT, Co. has agreed to retain, and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from Crane NXT, Co. will be sufficient to protectCrane Company against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Crane NXT, Co. will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. In addition, Crane NXT, Co.s insurers may attempt to deny coverage to Crane Company forliabilities associated with certain occurrences of indemnified liabilities prior to the spin-off.  If the distribution of shares of Crane Company, togetherwith certain related transactions, does not qualify for the intended tax treatment, you and Crane NXT, Co. could be subject to significant U.S. federal income tax liability and, in certain circumstances, Crane Company could be required to indemnifyCrane NXT for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the anticipated tax matters agreement.  Crane Holdings, Co. has received the IRSRuling on certain issues relevant to the qualification of the distribution under sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, based on certain facts and representations set forth in such request. The IRS Ruling does not address all of the requirementsrelevant to the qualification of the distribution for the intended tax treatment.  It is a condition to the completion of the distribution that Crane Holdings, Co.receives the Tax Opinion (unless waived by Crane Holdings, Co. in its sole discretion). The Tax Opinion will rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Crane Holdings, Co. and Crane Company, including those regardingthe past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters. Notwithstanding the Tax Opinion, the IRS could determine that the distribution or any such related transaction is taxable if it determines that any of thesefacts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated, or that the distribution should be taxable for other reasons, including if the IRS were to disagree with the conclusions in the Tax Opinion. If the distribution or any of the above referenced related transactions is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a stockholder of CraneHoldings, Co. that has received shares of Crane Company common stock in the distribution and Crane NXT could each incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. In addition, Crane NXT and we could incur significant U.S. federal income taxobligations, whether under applicable law or under the tax matters agreement that Crane Company intends to enter into with Crane Holdings, Co.   22 Table of ContentsCrane Company may not be able to engage in certain corporate transactions after the spin-off. Crane Company and Crane Holdings, Co., which will be renamed Crane NXT, Co., intend to enter into a tax matters agreement immediately prior to thedistribution that will, in relevant part, generally govern Crane Company and Crane NXT, Co.s respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to tax liabilities and benefits. The tax matters agreement is not anticipated to restrict us expressly from taking actions after the distribution that could adversely affect the intended U.S. federalincome tax treatment of the distribution, together with certain related transactions. Nevertheless, under the anticipated tax matters agreement, we may be required to indemnify Crane NXT, Co. against certain tax liabilities as a result of ouractions or the acquisition of our stock or assets, including in certain circumstances where such actions or acquisitions may be outside of our control. Our anticipated indemnity obligation to Crane NXT, Co. in the tax matters agreement is notlimited in amount. In addition, even if we are not responsible for tax liabilities of Crane NXT under the anticipated tax matters agreement, we nonetheless could potentially be liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities if Crane NXT wereto fail to pay such taxes.  Any anticipated indemnity obligation to Crane NXT, Co. in the tax matters agreement or under applicable tax law might discourage, delayor prevent us from taking certain actions, particularly for the two years following the distribution, including (among other things) the ability to freely issue stock, to make acquisitions, to raise additional equity capital or to effect a change incontrol that we or our stockholders may consider favorable. Such anticipated indemnity obligations may, furthermore, limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that it may believe to be in the best interests ofour stockholders or that might otherwise increase the value of our business.  For a discussion of the tax matters agreement, see Item 13 Certain Relationshipsand Related Party TransactionsAgreements with Crane Holdings, Co. / Crane NXT, Co.Tax Matters Agreement of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The spin-off and related internal restructuring transactions may expose Crane Company to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulentconveyance laws and legal dividend requirements.  The spin-off could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. Fraudulentconveyances or transfers are generally defined to include (i) transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud current or future creditors or (ii) transfers made or obligations incurred for less thanreasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent, or that rendered the debtor insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due. A creditor or an entity acting on behalf of a creditor (including, withoutlimitation, a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy by Crane NXT, Co. or Crane Company or any of their respective subsidiaries) may bring a lawsuit alleging that the spin-off or any of the related transactions constituted a fraudulentconveyance. If a court accepts these allegations, it could impose a number of remedies, including, without limitation, voiding the distribution and returning Crane Companys assets or Crane Companys shares and subjecting Crane NXT, Co.and/or Crane Company to liability.  The distribution of Crane Company common stock is also subject to state corporate distribution statutes. Under Delaware GeneralCorporation Law (DGCL), a corporation may only pay dividends to its stockholders either (a) out of its surplus (net assets minus capital) or (b) if there is no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which thedividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Although Crane Holdings, Co. intends to make the distribution of Crane Company common stock entirely out of surplus, Crane Company and Crane Holdings, Co. cannot ensure that a court would reachthe same conclusion in determining the availability of surplus for the separation and the distribution to Crane Holdings, Co.s stockholders.  After thespin-off, certain of Crane Companys executive officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their previous positions at Crane. Because of their current or former positions with Crane, certain of Crane Companys expected executive officers and directors own equity interests in CraneHoldings, Co. Following the spin-off, even though Crane Companys Board of Directors will consist of a majority of directors who are independent, and Crane Companys expected executive officers who are currently employees of Crane willcease to be employees of Crane NXT, Co. upon the spin-off, some of Crane Companys executive officers and directors will continue to have a financial interest in shares of Crane NXT, Co. common stock. Continuing ownership of shares of CraneNXT, Co. common stock and equity awards could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest if the Company and Crane NXT pursue the same corporate opportunities or face decisions that could have different implications for the Companyand Crane NXT.  No vote of Crane Holdings, Co. stockholders is required in connection with the spin-off. No vote of Crane Holdings, Co. stockholders is required in connection with the spin-off. Accordingly, if this transaction occurs and you do not want to receive CraneCompany common stock in the distribution, your only recourse will be to divest yourself of your Crane Holdings, Co. common stock prior to the record date for the distribution or to sell your Crane Holdings, Co. common stock in theregular-way market in between the record date and the distribution date.  Crane Company may have received better terms from unaffiliated thirdparties than the terms it will receive in its agreements with Crane Holdings, Co.  The agreements Crane Company will enter into with Crane Holdings, Co. orCrane NXT, Co., as applicable, in connection with the spin-off, including the separation and distribution agreement, transition services agreement, tax matters agreement, intellectual property matters agreement and employee matters agreement, wereprepared in the context of Crane Companys spin-off from Crane while Crane Company was still a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crane Holdings, Co. Accordingly, during the period in which the terms of those agreements were prepared, Crane Company didnot have a board of directors or management team that was independent of Crane Holdings, Co. While the parties believe the terms reflect arms-length   23 Table of Contentsterms, there can be no assurance that Crane Company would not have received better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms it will receive in its agreements with Crane Holdings, Co.For more information, see Item 13 Certain Relationships and Related Party TransactionsAgreements with Crane Holdings, Co. / Crane NXT, Co. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some contracts and other assets which will need to be transferred or assigned from Crane to the Company in connection with Crane Companys spin-off from Crane mayrequire the consent or involvement of a third-party. If such consent is not given, Crane Company may not be entitled to the benefit of such contracts and other assets in the future, which could negatively impact the Companys financialcondition and future results of operations.  The separation and distribution agreement and various local transfer agreements will provide that in connection withCrane Companys spin-off from Crane, a number of contracts with third-parties and other assets are to be transferred or assigned from Crane to the Company. However, the transfer or assignment of certain of these contracts or assets may requireproviding guarantees or the consent of a third-party to such a transfer or assignment. Similarly, in some circumstances, Crane Companys business and another business unit of Crane Holdings, Co. are joint beneficiaries of contracts, and CraneCompany or its applicable subsidiary will need to enter into a new agreement with the third-party to replicate the existing contract or assign the portion of the existing contract related to the Crane Company business. It is possible that someparties may use the requirement of a guarantee or consent or the fact that the spin-off is occurring to seek more favorable contractual terms from Crane Company or its applicable subsidiary or to seek to terminate the contract. If Crane Company orits applicable subsidiary is unable to provide a guarantee or obtain such consents on commercially reasonable and satisfactory terms or if the contracts are terminated, Crane Company may be unable to obtain some of the benefits, assets andcontractual commitments which are intended to be allocated to Crane Company as part of Crane Companys spin-off from Crane. The failure to timely complete the assignment of existing contracts or assets, or the negotiation of new arrangements,or a termination of any of those arrangements, could negatively impact Crane Companys financial condition and future results of operations. In addition, where Crane Company or its applicable subsidiary does not intend to provide a guarantee orobtain consent from third-party counterparties based on Crane Companys or its applicable subsidiarys belief that no guarantee or consent is required, the third-party counterparties may challenge a transfer of assets on the basis that theterms of the applicable commercial arrangements require that a guarantee be provided or the third-party counterpartys consent. Crane Company may incur substantial litigation and other costs in connection with any such claims and, if CraneCompany does not prevail, the Companys ability to use these assets could be adversely impacted.  After the spin-off, Crane Companys access to andcost of financing may be different from the historical access to and cost of financing available to Crane, which may have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition or results of operations and cash flows. Crane Company has historically relied upon Crane to finance its working capital requirements and other cash requirements. After the distribution, Crane Company willnot be able to rely on the earnings, assets or cash flow of Crane NXT and Crane NXT will not provide funds to finance Crane Companys working capital or other cash requirements. As a result, after the distribution, Crane Company will beresponsible for obtaining and maintaining sufficient working capital and other funds to satisfy its cash requirements and for servicing its own debt. After the spin-off, Crane Companys access to and cost of debt financing may be different fromthe historical access to and cost of debt financing that was available to Crane. Differences in access to and cost of debt financing may result in differences in the margins charged to the Company on debt financings, as well as the amounts ofindebtedness, types of financing structures and debt markets that may be available to Crane Company.  Crane Companys ability to make payments on and torefinance any indebtedness, if applicable, will depend on its ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Crane Companys ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive,legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond Crane Companys control. If Crane Company is not able to repay or refinance its debt as it becomes due, the Company may be forced to sell assets or take other actions. In addition, CraneCompanys ability to withstand competitive pressures and react to changes in the Companys industry could be impaired by its debt service obligations. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default under any agreements governing CraneCompanys indebtedness, the holders of such debt may, in some cases, elect to accelerate amounts due thereunder, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the Companys other debt. In addition, Crane Company entered into a new credit agreement in connection with the distribution and may incur new debt or raise additional capital following thedistribution. However, debt or equity financing may not be available to Crane Company on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. If Crane Company incurs additional debt or raises equity through the issuance of preferred stock, the terms of thedebt or preferred stock issued may give the holders thereof rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of Crane Company common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. The terms of such debt may also impose additional andmore stringent restrictions on Crane Companys operations than it is currently subject to. If the Company raises funds through the issuance of additional Crane Company equity, your percentage ownership in Crane Company would be diluted. IfCrane Company is unable to raise additional capital when needed, it could affect the Companys financial condition, which could negatively affect your investment in Crane Company. Following the spin-off, our stock price may fluctuate significantly. An active trading market for our common stock is expected to be initiated following the separation, which may affect your ability to sell shares of Crane Company commonstock and could lead to our share price being depressed or more volatile. For many reasons, including the risks identified in this Risk Factors
 section, the market price of our common stock following the separation may be more volatilethan the market price of Crane Holdings, Co.s common stock before the separation. These factors may result in short-term or long-term negative pressure on the value of our common stock. We cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors includingthe future performance of Crane Company as a separate, independent company.  In addition, if the market for stocks in our industry, or the stock market in general,experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations, if any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price tofall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if successfully defended, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.   24 Table of ContentsUntil the distribution occurs, Crane Holdings, Co. has the sole discretion to change the terms of thedistribution in ways which may be unfavorable to Crane Company.  Completion of the spin-off will be contingent upon customary closing conditions, including,among other things, finalization of the entity structure of Crane Company, finalization of the capital structure of the two companies, the effectiveness of appropriate filings with the SEC and final approval from Crane Holdings, Co.s Board ofDirectors. Until the distribution occurs, Crane Holdings, Co. will have the sole and absolute discretion to determine and change the terms of the distribution, including the establishment of the record date and distribution date and the conditionsto the spin-off and all other terms. These changes could be unfavorable to Crane Company. In addition, Crane Holdings, Co. may decide at any time not to proceed with the spin-off. Crane NXT may compete with us.  Crane NXT will not be restricted fromcompeting with us. If Crane NXT in the future decides to engage in the type of business we conduct, it may have a competitive advantage over us, which may cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to be materially adverselyaffected.  Certain non-U.S. entities or assets that are part of Crane Companys spin-off from Crane may not be transferred to us prior to thedistribution or at all.  Certain non-U.S. entities and assets that are part of Crane Companys spin-off from Crane may not be transferred prior to thedistribution because the entities or assets, as applicable, are subject to foreign government or third-party approvals that we may not receive prior to the distribution. Such approvals may include, but are not limited to, approvals to merge ordemerge, to form new legal entities (including obtaining required registrations and/or licenses or permits) and to transfer assets and/or liabilities. It is currently anticipated that all material transfers will occur without delays prior to thedistribution, but we cannot offer any assurance that such transfers will ultimately occur or not be delayed for an extended period of time. To the extent such transfers do not occur prior to the distribution, under the separation and distributionagreement, the economic benefits and burdens of owning such assets and/or entities will, to the extent reasonably possible and permitted by applicable law, be provided to Crane Company. In the event such transfers do not occur or are significantly delayed because we do not receive the required approvals, we may not realize all of the anticipatedbenefits of Crane Companys spin-off from Crane and we may be dependent on Crane NXT for transition services for a longer period of time than would otherwise be the case.  "
