These are inaddition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report of Form 10-K andin the Companys other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.The current volatility in global economic conditions and the financial markets may adversely affectour industry, business and results of operations.The volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets since mid-2008 has rapidlyimpacted global economic conditions, resulting in significant recessionary pressures and declinesin consumer confidence and economic growth. These conditions led to economic contractions in thedeveloped economies and reduced growth rates in the emerging markets. Recent conditions have begunto improve, although potential volatility continues to exist. Despite fiscal and monetaryintervention, it is possible that further declines in, or depressed levels of consumer spending andglobal growth rates may occur in the foreseeable future. Reduced consumer spending may causechanges in customer order patterns including order cancellations, and changes in the level ofinventory at our customers, which may adversely affect our industry, business and results ofoperations. The impact of the credit crisis and economic slowdown will vary by region andcountry. The diversity of our geographic customer and operating footprint limits our reliance andexposure to any single economy. 7Table of ContentsThese conditions have also resulted in a substantial tightening of the credit markets,including lending by financial institutions and in the commercial paper market, both of which aresources of credit for our borrowing and liquidity. This tightening of the credit markets hasincreased the cost of capital and reduced the availability of credit. Based on our latestdiscussions, we believe that the financial institutions syndicated under our revolving creditfacility are able to fulfill their commitments as of our filing date. While conditions haveimproved recently, it is difficult to predict how long the current economic and capital and creditmarket conditions will continue, whether they will deteriorate and which aspects of our products orbusiness could be adversely affected. However, if current levels of economic and capital andcredit market disruption and volatility continue or worsen, there can be no assurance that we willnot experience an adverse impact, which may be material, on our business, the cost of and access tocapital and credit markets, and our results of operations. In addition, we monitor the financialcondition of our customers on a regular basis based on public information or data provided directlyto us. If the financial condition of one of our major customers was negatively impacted by marketconditions, liquidity, or other adverse events, we could be adversely impacted in terms of salespotential, excess capacity, accounts receivable and/or inventory specifically attributable to them.Failure to maintain the integrity of our raw materials, supply chain and finished goods mayadversely impact sales and our results of operations, IFFs reputation and litigation costs.The manufacture and sale of our products are subject to various regulatory requirements ineach of the countries in which our products are manufactured and sold. In addition, we are subjectto product safety and compliance requirements established by the industry or similar oversightbodies. We use a variety of strategies, methodologies and tools to identify current productsstandards, assess relative risks in our supply chain that can impact product integrity, monitorinternal and external performance and test raw materials and finished goods to minimize thelikelihood of product or process non-compliance.If a non-compliance event went undetected, we could be subject to customer claims, penalties,litigation costs and/or settlements, remediation costs or loss of sales. These consequences wouldbe exacerbated if our customer did not identify the defect and there was a resulting impact at theconsumer level. This could lead to potentially large scale adverse publicity and potentialconsumer litigation.Competitive factors may negatively impact our sales and marketability.The market for flavors and fragrances is fragmented and highly competitive. IFF competes withmany companies and some of our competitors specialize in one or more of our product segments whileothers participate in many of the same segments. In addition, some of our competitors may havegreater financial and technical resources. The discovery and development of new flavor andfragrance materials, protection of the Companys intellectual property and development andretention of key employees are important issues in our ability to compete in our businesses.Increased competition by existing or future competitors, including aggressive price competition,could result in the potential loss of substantial sales or create the need for us to reduce pricesor increase spending and this could have an impact on sales and profitability.We are subject to economic and social changes which may impact sales.Demand for consumer products using flavors and fragrances has been stimulated and broadened bychanging social habits resulting from factors such as increases in personal income, dual-earnerhouseholds, teenage population, leisure time, health concerns and urbanization and by the continuedgrowth in world population. Changes in any number of external economic factors, or changes insocial or consumer preferences, could materially adversely impact our results of operations.Nearly 56% of our sales occur in the developed markets of North America, Western Europe andAustralasia with the remainder in emerging markets. Accordingly, the impact on our operations willdepend upon consumer spending on products for which we supply the flavor or fragrance in theseglobal markets.Results may be negatively impacted by the price, quality and availability of raw materials.Raw materials are purchased from many sources from all over the world, including essentialoils, extracts and concentrates derived from fruits, vegetables, flowers, woods and otherbotanicals, animal products, raw fruits and organic chemicals. Disruptions in the supply or qualityof ingredients or rising prices for ingredients purchased could adversely impact our results ofoperations and profitability. Historically, we have experienced the greatest amount of volatilityin natural products that represent approximately 50% of raw material purchases. Availability andpricing of these products, such as citrus, can be impacted by crop size and quality, weather,demand balance or alternative land use. To mitigate our sourcing risk, we maintain strategic stocklevels covering multiple periods for critical items and/or time purchases to capitalize onfavorable market conditions. 8Table of ContentsResults may be negatively impacted by the inability to implement our business strategy, includingthe achievement of anticipated cost savings, profitability or growth targets.We are committed to those particular business strategies and market segments that have beenidentified as likely to drive profitable future growth and improve operations and customer service.If we are unable to successfully and timely implement these strategies, it would adversely impactour financial condition and results of operations.Results may be negatively affected by the impact of currency fluctuation or devaluation inprincipal foreign markets and the effectiveness of hedging and risk management strategies.Our operations are conducted in many countries, the results of which are reported in the localcurrency and then translated into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates. The exchange ratesbetween these currencies and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated and may continue to do so in thefuture. We employ a variety of techniques to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations,including sourcing strategies and a limited number of foreign currency hedging activities.However, volatility in currency exchange rates may materially adversely impact our reported resultsof operations, financial condition or liquidity.Results may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to litigation.We are involved in a number of legal claims. While we believe that related insurance coverageis adequate with respect to such claims, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such litigation.In addition, we cannot provide assurance that future events will not result in an increase in thenumber of claims or require an increase in the amount accrued for any such claims, or requireaccrual for one or more claims that has not been previously accrued.Results and cash flows may be negatively impacted by future pension funding and otherpostretirement obligations.We establish assumptions concerning discount rates and actuarial assumptions regarding pensionfunding and other postretirement benefit obligations based on current market conditions, planparticipants, asset returns, interest rates and other factors. Changes in pension and otherpostretirement benefits, plan assets, and associated expenses may occur in the future due tochanges in capital markets, employee demographics and actuarial assumptions. These changes mayadversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.Results may be negatively impacted by the effect of legal and regulatory requirements, as well asrestrictions imposed on operations by foreign and domestic governmental entities.The manufacture and sale of our products are subject to regulation in the United States by theFood and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco andFirearms, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration,the Drug Enforcement Administration and state authorities. In addition, we are subject to productsafety and compliance requirements established by the industry or similar oversight bodies. Ourforeign operations are subject to similar substantial governmental regulation and oversightstandards in a number of countries, including extensive requirements within the European Union.Costs or investments necessary to maintain compliance with existing or future governmentalregulations may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.We may face risks associated with events which may affect the world economy.World events such as terrorist attacks, or regional conflicts have and may in the futureweaken world economies. Any resulting weaknesses in these economies may materially adverselyaffect our business or the businesses of our customers, with a resultant negative impact on ourfinancial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 9Table of ContentsOur success depends on attracting and retaining talented people within our business. Any shortfallin recruitment or retention could adversely affect our ability to compete and achieve our strategicgoals.Attracting, developing, and retaining talented employees is essential to the successfuldelivery of our products and success in the marketplace. The ability to attract and retaintalented employees is critical in the development of new products that meet the needs of ourcustomers. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract and retain such employeesin the future. Any shortfalls in recruitment or retention could adversely affect our ability tooperate successfully, retain our existing customers, grow our business, and effectively competewith our competitors.Our operations may be affected by greenhouse emissions and climate change and related regulations.The availability of raw materials and energy supplies fluctuate in markets throughout theworld. Climate change may also effect the availability and price of key raw materials, includingnatural products used in the manufacture of our products. In order to mitigate the risk of priceincreases and shortages, purchasing has developed various sourcing strategies including multiplesuppliers, inventory management systems, various geographic suppliers and long term agreements tomitigate risk.In addition to market forces there are various regulatory efforts relating to climate changethat may increase the cost of raw materials, especially energy used to operate our facilities thatcould materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure toadditional tax liabilities could affect our future results.We are subject to taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our futureeffective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differingstatutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes inreserves and contingencies, cost of repatriations or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.In addition, the current administration and Congress have announced proposals for new U.S. taxlegislation that, if adopted, could adversely affect our tax rate. Any of these changes could havea material adverse affect on our profitability. We are also subject to the continual examination ofour income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularlyassess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine theadequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from theseexaminations will not materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results"
