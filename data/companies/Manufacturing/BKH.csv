8,BKH,BLACK HILLS CORP,2022-02-15,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSThe nature of our business subjects us to a number of uncertainties and risks. Risks that may adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows are described below. These risk factors, along with other risk factors that we discuss in our periodic reports filed with the SEC should be considered for a better understanding of our Company.STRATEGIC RISKSOur continued success is dependent on execution of our strategic business plans including our growth strategy.Our success depends, in significant part, on our ability to execute our strategic business plans, including our growth strategy.  Our plans and strategy include building sustainable operations and supporting the Energy Transition; consistently outperforming utility industry averages in key safety metrics; modernizing utility infrastructure; transforming the customer experience; growing our electric and natural gas customer load; and pursuing operating efficiencies. Our current plans and strategy may be negatively impacted by disruptive forces and innovations in the marketplace, changing political, business or regulatory conditions and technology advancements.In addition, we have significant capital investment programs planned for the next five years that are key to our strategic business plans. The successful execution of our capital investment program depends on, or could be affected by, a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to: weather conditions, effective management of projects, availability of qualified construction personnel including contractors, changes in commodity and other prices, availability and inflationary cost of materials, governmental approvals and permitting, regulatory cost recovery and return on investment.An inability to successfully and timely adapt to changing conditions and execute our strategic plans could materially affect our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.Customer growth and usage in our service territories may fluctuate with economic conditions, emerging technologies, political influences or responses to price increases.Our financial operating results are impacted by energy demand in our service territories. Customer growth and usage may be impacted by a number of factors, including the voluntary reduction in consumption of electricity and natural gas by our customers in response to increases in prices and energy efficiency programs, electrification initiatives that could negatively impact the demand for natural gas, economic conditions impacting customers’ disposable income and the use of distributed generation resources or other emerging technologies. Continued technological improvements may make customer and third-party distributed generation and energy storage systems, including fuel cells, micro-turbines, wind turbines, solar cells and batteries, more cost effective and feasible for our customers. If more customers utilize their own generation, demand for energy from us could decline. Such developments could affect the price of energy and delivery of energy, require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands and could make portions of our electric system power supply and transmission and/or distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives. Each of these factors could materially affect our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.REGULATORY, LEGISLATIVE AND LEGAL RISKSWe may be subject to future laws, regulations or actions associated with climate change, including those relating to fossil-fuel generation and GHG emissions, which could increase our operating costs or restrict our market opportunities.We own and operate regulated and non-regulated electric power plants that burn fossil fuels (natural gas and coal) and a surface mine that extracts and sells coal. We also purchase, store and deliver natural gas to our customers. These business activities are subject to evolving public concern regarding fossil fuels, GHG emissions (such as carbon dioxide and methane) and their impact on the climate.There is uncertainty surrounding climate regulation due to legal challenges to some current regulations and anticipated new federal and/or state climate legislation and regulation. New or more stringent regulations or other energy efficiency requirements could require us to incur significant additional costs relating to, among other things, the installation of additional emission control equipment, the acceleration of capital expenditures, the purchase of additional emissions allowances or offsets, the acquisition or development of additional energy supply from renewable resources, the closure or capacity reductions of coal-fired power generation facilities or conversion to natural gas, and potential increased production from our combined cycle natural gas-fired generating units. Additional rules and regulations associated with fossil fuels and GHG emissions could result in the impairment or retirement of some of our existing or future transmission, distribution, generation and natural gas storage facilities or our coal mine. Further, these rules could create the need to purchase or build clean-energy fuel sources to fulfill obligations to our customers. These actions could also result in increased operating costs which could adversely impact customers and our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity. We cannot definitively estimate the effect of GHG legislation or regulation on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.21Table of ContentsFuture GHG constraints designed to minimize emissions from natural gas could likewise result in increased costs and affect the demand for natural gas as well as the prices charged to customers and the competitive position of natural gas among fuel alternatives. Certain cities in our operational footprint are focused on electrification and are considering initiatives that may restrict the direct use of natural gas in homes and businesses. Any such initiatives and legislation could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We may be subject to unfavorable or untimely federal and state regulatory outcomes.Our regulated Electric and Gas Utilities are subject to cost-of-service/rate-of-return regulation and earnings oversight from federal and eight state utility commissions. This regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of desired earnings levels. Our customer rates are regulated based on an analysis of our costs and investments, as reviewed and approved in regulatory proceedings. While rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that our various regulatory authorities will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will result in full or timely recovery of our costs with a reasonable return on invested capital. In addition, adverse rate decisions, including rate moratoriums, rate refunds, limits on rate increases, lower allowed returns on investments or rate reductions, could be influenced by competitive, economic, political, legislative, public perception and regulatory pressures and adversely impact results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Each of our Electric and Gas Utilities are permitted to recover certain costs (such as increased fuel and purchased power costs, including incremental costs from Winter Storm Uri, or integrity capital investments) outside of a base rate review in order to stabilize customer rates and reduce regulatory lag. If regulators decide to discontinue these tariff-based recovery mechanisms, it could negatively impact results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Costs could significantly increase to achieve or maintain compliance with existing or future environmental laws, regulations or requirements.Our business segments are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of present and future operations, including air emissions (i.e. SO2, NOx, volatile organic compounds, particulate matter and GHG), water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous waste. These laws and regulations may result in increased capital, operating and other costs. These laws and regulations generally require the business segments to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other government approvals. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may require significant expenditures, including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising from contaminated properties.  Failure or inability to comply with evolving environmental regulations may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive measures affecting operating assets.Our business segments may not be successful in recovering increased capital and operating costs incurred to comply with new environmental regulations through existing regulatory rate structures and contracts with customers. More stringent environmental laws or regulations could result in additional costs of operation for existing facilities or impede the development of new facilities.  Although it is not expected that the costs to comply with current environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business segments’ financial position, results of operations or cash flows, future environmental compliance costs could have a significant negative impact.Legislative and regulatory requirements may result in compliance penalties.Business activities in the energy sector are heavily regulated, primarily by agencies of the federal government. Many agencies  employ mandatory civil penalty structures for regulatory violations. The FERC, NERC, CFTC, EPA, OSHA, SEC, TSA and MSHA may impose significant civil and criminal penalties to enforce compliance requirements relative to our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.Municipal governments may seek to limit or deny our franchise privileges.Municipal governments within our utility service territories possess the power of condemnation and could establish a municipal utility within a portion of our current service territories by limiting or denying franchise privileges for our operations and exercising powers of condemnation over all or part of our utility assets within municipal boundaries. We regularly engage in negotiations on renewals of franchise agreements with our municipal governments. We have from time to time faced challenges or ballot initiatives on franchise renewals. To date, we have been successful in resolving or defending each of these challenges. Although condemnation is a process that is subject to constitutional protections requiring just and fair compensation, as with any judicial procedure, the outcome is uncertain. If a municipality sought to pursue this course of action, we cannot assure that we would secure adequate recovery of our investment in assets subject to condemnation. We also cannot quantify the impact that such action would have on the remainder of our business operations.22Table of ContentsChanges in Federal tax law may significantly impact our business.We are subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the federal, state and local levels where we operate. Similar to the TCJA, sweeping legislation or regulation could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities which may affect our tax burden. Changes may include numerous provisions that affect businesses, including changes to corporate tax rates, business-related exclusions, and deductions and credits. The outcome of regulatory proceedings regarding the extent to which a change in corporate tax rate will affect our utility customers and the time period over which that change will occur could significantly impact future earnings and cash flows. Separately, a challenge by a taxing authority, changes in taxing authorities’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions, our ability to utilize tax benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits, or a deviation from other tax-related assumptions may cause actual financial results to deviate from previous estimates.OPERATING RISKSOur financial performance depends on the successful operation of electric generating facilities, electric and natural gas transmission and distribution systems, natural gas storage facilities and a coal mine.The risks associated with managing these operations include:•Inherent dangers. Electricity and natural gas can be dangerous to employees and the general public. Failures of or contact with power lines, natural gas pipelines or service facilities and equipment may result in fires, explosions, property damage and personal injuries, including death. While we maintain liability and property insurance coverage, such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles. The occurrence of any of these events may not be fully covered by our insurance;•Weather, natural conditions and disasters including impacts from climate change. Severe weather events, such as snow and ice storms (e.g., Winter Storm Uri), fires, tornadoes, strong winds, significant thunderstorms, flooding and drought, could negatively impact operations, including our ability to provide energy safely, reliably and profitably and our ability to complete construction, expansion or refurbishment of facilities as planned. Climate change may intensify these events or increase the frequency of occurrence;•Acts of sabotage, terrorism or other malicious attacks. Damage to our facilities due to deliberate acts could lead to outages or other adverse effects;•Operating hazards. Operating hazards such as leaks, mechanical problems and accidents, including fires or explosions, could impact employee and public safety, reliability and customer confidence;•Equipment and processes. Breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, unavailability or increased cost of equipment, and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency could negatively impact our results of operations;•Disrupted transmission and distribution. We depend on transmission and distribution facilities, including those operated by unaffiliated parties, to deliver the electricity and natural gas that we sell to our retail and wholesale customers. If transmission is interrupted physically, mechanically or with cyber means, our ability to sell or deliver utility services and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered;•Natural gas supply for generation and distribution. Our regulated utilities and non-regulated entities purchase natural gas from a number of suppliers for our generating facilities and for distribution to our customers. Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by the lack of availability and cost of natural gas, and disruptions in the delivery of natural gas due to various factors, including but not limited to, transportation delays, labor relations, weather, sabotage, cyber-attacks and environmental regulations;•Replacement power. The cost of supplying or securing replacement power during scheduled and unscheduled outages of generation facilities could negatively impact our results of operations;•Governmental permits. The inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals along with the cost of complying with or satisfying conditions imposed upon such approvals could negatively impact our ability to operateand our results of operations;•Operational limitations. Operational limitations imposed by environmental and other regulatory requirements and contractual agreements, including those that restrict the timing of generation plant scheduled outages, could negatively impact our results of operations;•Increased costs. Increased capital and operating costs to comply with increasingly stringent laws and regulations, unexpected engineering, environmental and geological problems, and unanticipated cost overruns could negatively impact our results of operations;23Table of Contents•Supply chain disruptions. We rely on various suppliers in our supply chain for the materials necessary to execute on our capital investment program. Our supply chain, material costs, and capital investment program may be negatively impacted by unanticipated price increases due to factors exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as inflation, including wage inflation, or due to supply restrictions beyond our control or the control of our suppliers;•Labor and labor relations. The cost of recruiting and retaining skilled technical labor or the unavailability of such resources could have a negative impact on our operations. There is competition and a tightening market for skilled employees. During the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recovery, there is a national trend of increased employee turnover. Our ability to transition and replace our retirement-eligible utility employees is a risk; at December 31, 2021, approximately 22% of our Electric Utilities and Gas Utilities employees were eligible for retirement. Our ability to avoid or minimize supply interruptions, work stoppages and labor disputes is also a risk with approximately 25% of our employees are represented by unions; and•Public opposition. Opposition by members of public or special-interest groups could negatively impact our ability to operate our businesses.The ongoing operation of our business involves the risks described above, in addition to risks associated with threats to our overall business model, such as electrification initiatives. Any of these risks could cause us to experience negative financial results and damage to our reputation and public confidence. These risks could cause us to incur significant costs or be unable to deliver energy and/or operate below expected capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues or cause us to incur higher operating and maintenance costs and penalties. While we maintain insurance, obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance and our rights under contracts, warranties or performance guarantees may not be timely or adequate to cover lost revenues, increased expenses, liability or liquidated damage payments.Cyberattacks, terrorism, or other malicious acts targeting our key technology systems could disrupt our operations, or lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information.To effectively operate our business, we rely upon a sophisticated electronic control system, information and operation technology systems and network infrastructure to generate, distribute and deliver energy, and collect and retain sensitive information including personal information about our customers and employees. Cyberattacks, terrorism or other malicious acts targeting electronic control systems could result in a full or partial disruption of our electric and/or natural gas operations. Attacks targeting other key technology systems, including our third-party vendors’ information systems, could further add to a full or partial disruption of our operations. Any disruption of these operations could result in a loss of service to customers and associated revenues, as well as significant expense to repair damages and remedy security breaches. In addition, any theft, loss and/or fraudulent use of customer, shareowner, employee or proprietary data could subject us to significant litigation, liability and costs, as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators, among others. We maintain cyber risk insurance to mitigate a portion, but not all, or these risks and losses.In May and July 2021, the TSA issued security directives that included several new cybersecurity requirements for critical pipeline owners and operators. Among these requirements is the implementation of specific mitigation measures to protect against ransomware attacks and other known threats to information and operational technology systems; development and implementation of a cybersecurity contingency and recovery plan; and performance of a cybersecurity architecture design review. We are currently implementing several of these directives and evaluating the potential effect of several others on our operations and facilities, as well as the potential cost of implementation, and will continue to monitor for any clarifications or amendments to these directives.We have instituted security measures and safeguards to protect our operational systems and information technology assets, including certain safeguards required by FERC. Despite our implementation of security measures and safeguards, all of our technology systems may still be vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access.Weather conditions, including the impacts of climate change, may cause fluctuation in customer usage.Our utility businesses are seasonal businesses and weather conditions and patterns can have a material impact on our operating performance. To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers’ energy use could increase or decrease. Demand for electricity is typically greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating, respectively. Demand for natural gas depends heavily upon winter-weather patterns throughout our service territory and a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating season.  Accordingly, our utility operations have historically generated lower revenues and income when weather conditions are cooler than normal in the summer and warmer than normal in the winter. Demand for natural gas is also impacted by summer weather patterns that are cooler than normal and provide higher than normal precipitation; both of which can reduce natural gas demand for irrigation. Unusually mild summers and winters, therefore, could have an adverse effect on our financial operating results, including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.24Table of ContentsFINANCIAL RISKSA sub-investment grade credit rating could impact our ability to access capital markets.Our senior unsecured debt rating is Baa2 (Stable outlook) by Moody’s; BBB+ (Stable outlook) by S&P; and BBB+ (Stable outlook) by Fitch. Reduction of our investment grade credit ratings could impair our ability to refinance or repay our existing debt and complete new financings on reasonable terms, if at all. A credit rating downgrade, particularly to sub-investment grade, could also result in counterparties requiring us to post additional collateral under existing or new contracts. In addition, a ratings downgrade would increase our interest expense under some of our existing debt obligations, including borrowings under our credit facilities, potentially significantly increasing our cost of capital and other associated operating costs which may not be recoverable through existing regulatory rate structures and contracts with customers.Our use of derivative financial instruments as hedges against commodity prices and financial market risks could result in material financial losses.We use various financial and physical derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, to manage commodity price and interest rate risks. The timing of the recognition of gains or losses on these economic hedges in accordance with GAAP may not consistently match up with the gains or losses on the commodities being hedged. For Black Hills Energy Services under the Choice Gas Program, and in certain instances within our regulated Utilities where unrealized and realized gains and losses from derivative instruments are not approved for regulatory accounting treatment, fluctuating commodity prices may cause fluctuations in reported financial results due to mark-to-market accounting treatment.To the extent that we hedge our commodity price and interest rate exposures, we forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in our favor. In addition, even though they are closely monitored by management, our hedging activities can result in losses. Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the hedge arrangement, the hedge is economically imperfect, commodity prices or interest rates move unfavorably related to our physical or financial positions, or hedging policies and procedures are not followed.Additionally, our exchange-traded futures contracts are subject to futures margin posting requirements. To the extent we are unable to meet these requirements, this could have a significant impact on our business by reducing our ability to execute derivative transactions to reduce commodity price uncertainty and to protect cash flows. Requirements to post collateral may cause significant liquidity issues by reducing our ability to use cash for investment or other corporate purposes, or may require us to increase our level of debt. Further, a requirement for our counterparties to post collateral could result in additional costs being passed on to us, thereby decreasing our profitability.We have a holding company corporate structure with multiple subsidiaries.  Corporate dividends and debt payments are dependent upon cash distributions to the holding company from the subsidiaries.As a holding company, our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets. Our operating cash flow and ability to service our indebtedness depend on the operating cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends or advances. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available for that purpose, whether by dividends or otherwise. In addition, each subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to us depends on any applicable contractual or regulatory restrictions that may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of cash, working capital, equity or debt service funds.There is no assurance as to the amount, if any, of future dividends to the holding company because these subsidiaries depend on future earnings, capital requirements and financial conditions to fund such dividends. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these restrictions and their impact on our liquidity.25Table of ContentsWe may be unable to obtain financing on reasonable terms needed to refinance debt, fund planned capital expenditures or otherwise execute our operating strategy.Our ability to execute our operating strategy is highly dependent upon our access to capital. Historically, we have addressed our liquidity needs (including funds required to make scheduled principal and interest payments, refinance debt, pay dividends and fund working capital and planned capital expenditures) with operating cash flow, borrowings under credit facilities, proceeds of debt and equity offerings and proceeds from asset sales. Our ability to access the capital markets and the costs and terms of available financing depend on many factors, including changes in our credit ratings, changes in the federal or state regulatory environment affecting energy companies, volatility in commodity or electricity prices and general economic and market conditions.In addition, because we are a holding company and our utility assets are owned by our subsidiaries, if we are unable to adequately access the credit markets, we could be required to take additional measures designed to ensure that our utility subsidiaries are adequately capitalized to provide safe and reliable service. Possible additional measures would be evaluated in the context of then-prevailing market conditions, prudent financial management and any applicable regulatory requirements.National and regional economic conditions may cause increased counterparty credit risk, late payments and uncollectible accounts.A future recession or pandemic, if one occurs, may lead to an increase in late payments or non-payment from retail residential, commercial and industrial utility customers, as well as from our non-utility customers. If late payments and uncollectible accounts increase, earnings and cash flows from our continuing operations may be reduced.We may be unable to obtain insurance coverage, and the coverage we currently have may not apply or may be insufficient to cover a significant loss.Our ability to obtain insurance, as well as the cost of such insurance, could be impacted by developments affecting the insurance industry and the financial condition of insurers. Additionally, insurance providers could deny coverage or decline to extend coverage under the same or similar terms that are presently available to us. A loss for which we are not adequately insured could materially affect our financial results. The coverage we currently have in place may not apply to a particular loss, or it may not be sufficient to cover all liabilities to which the Company may be subject, including liability and losses associated with climate change, wildfire, natural gas and storage field explosions, cyber-security breaches, environmental hazards and natural disasters.Market performance or changes in key valuation assumptions could require us to make significant unplanned contributions to our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans.Assumptions related to interest rates, expected return on investments, mortality and other key actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on our funding requirements and the expense recognized related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. An adverse change to key assumptions associated with our defined benefit retirement plans may require significant unplanned contributions to the plans which could adversely affect our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.Costs associated with our healthcare plans and other benefits could increase significantly.The costs of providing healthcare benefits to our employees and retirees have increased substantially in recent years. We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs related to healthcare plans for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise. Significant regulatory developments have required, and likely will continue to require, changes to our current employee benefit plans and supporting administrative processes. Our electric and natural gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding. Within our utility rates, we have generally recovered the cost of providing employee benefits. As benefit costs continue to rise, however, there is no assurance that the utility commissions will allow recovery of these increased costs. The rising employee benefit costs, or inadequate recovery of such costs, may adversely affect our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow, or liquidity.PANDEMIC RISKThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including its variants, or any other pandemic and the associated impact on business and economic conditions could negatively affect our business operations, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.The scale and scope of the COVID-19 outbreak, the resulting pandemic or any other future pandemic, and the associated impact on the economy and financial markets could adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. As a provider of essential services, the Company has an obligation to provide electric and natural gas services to our customers. The Company remains focused on protecting the health of our customers, employees and the communities in which we operate while assuring the continuity of our business operations.26Table of ContentsAlthough the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its variants to our 2021 results of operation was not significant, we cannot ultimately predict whether it will have a material impact on our future liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. We also  cannot predict the impact of COVID-19 on the health of our employees, our supply chain or our ability to mitigate higher costs associated with managing through the COVID-19 pandemic.As recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic continues, additional uncertainties have emerged, including the impacts of:•vaccine mandates and testing requirements on our workforce;•inflation increasing prices of commodities and materials, outside services, employee costs and interest rates;•supply chain disruptions on the availability and cost of materials; and•labor shortages and increased turnover on costs of retaining and attracting employees.The situation remains fluid and it is difficult to predict with certainty the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any other future pandemic, on our financial operating results including earnings, cash flows and liquidity"
12,BKH,BLACK HILLS CORP,2021-02-26,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSThe nature of our business subjects us to a number of uncertainties and risks.  Risks that may adversely affect the business operations, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows are described below.  These risk factors, along with other risk factors that we discuss in our periodic reports filed with the SEC should be considered for a better understanding of our Company. STRATEGIC RISKSOur continued success is dependent on execution of our strategic business plans including our growth strategy.Our success depends, in significant part, on our ability to execute our strategic business plans, including our growth strategy.  Our plans and strategy include reducing GHG emissions for our Electric Utilities and Gas Utilities, transforming the customer experience, growing our electric and natural gas customer load, pursuing operating efficiencies and modernizing our utility infrastructure. Our current plans and strategy may be negatively impacted by disruptive forces and innovations in the marketplace, changing political, business or regulatory conditions, and technology advancements.  In addition, we have significant capital investment programs planned for the next five years that are key to our strategic business plans.  The successful execution of our capital investment program depends on, or could be affected by, a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to: weather conditions, effective management of projects, availability of qualified construction personnel including contractors, changes in commodity and other prices, availability of materials, governmental approvals and permitting, regulatory cost recovery and return on investment.An inability to successfully and timely adapt to changing conditions and execute our strategic plans, including our growth strategy could materially affect our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.24Table of ContentsCustomer growth and usage in our service territories may fluctuate with economic conditions, emerging technologies or responses to price increases.Our financial operating results are impacted by energy demand in our service territories.  Customer growth and usage may be impacted by a number of factors, including the voluntary reduction in consumption of electricity and natural gas by our customers in response to increases in prices and energy efficiency programs, electrification initiatives that could negatively impact the demand for natural gas, economic conditions impacting customers’ disposable income and the use of distributed generation resources or other emerging technologies.  Continued technological improvements may make customer and third-party distributed generation and energy storage systems, including fuel cells, micro-turbines, wind turbines, solar cells and batteries, more cost effective and feasible for our customers.

We also purchase, store and deliver natural gas to our customers.  These business activities are subject to evolving public concern regarding fossil fuels, GHG emissions (such as carbon dioxide and methane) and their impact on the climate.There is uncertainty surrounding climate regulation due to legal challenges to some current regulations and anticipated new federal and/or state climate legislation and regulation.  The Biden administration has issued executive orders aimed at reducing GHG emissions and declared climate change a national security policy for the first time.  New or more stringent regulations or other energy efficiency requirements could require us to incur significant additional costs relating to, among other things, the installation of additional emission control equipment, the acceleration of capital expenditures, the purchase of additional emissions allowances or offsets, the acquisition or development of additional energy supply from renewable resources, the closure or capacity reductions of coal-fired power generation facilities and potential increased production from our combined cycle natural gas-fired generating units.  Increased rules and regulations associated with fossil fuels and GHG emissions could result in the impairment or retirement of some of our existing or future transmission, distribution, generation and natural gas storage facilities or our coal mine.

Certain cities in our operational footprint are focused on electrification and have adopted initiatives to prohibit the construction of new natural gas distribution facilities.  Any such initiatives and legislation could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We may be subject to unfavorable or untimely federal and state regulatory outcomes.Our regulated Electric and Gas Utilities are subject to cost-of-service/rate-of-return regulation and earnings oversight from federal and eight state utility commissions.  This regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of desired earnings levels.  Our customer rates are regulated by either the FERC or the respective state utility regulatory authority based on an analysis of our costs and investments, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding.

Failures of or contact with power lines, natural gas pipelines or service facilities and equipment may result in fires, explosions, property damage and personal injuries, including death.  While we maintain liability and property insurance coverage, such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles.  The occurrence of any of these events may not be fully covered by our insurance;26Table of Contents•Weather, natural conditions and disasters.  Severe weather events, such as snow and ice storms, fires, tornadoes, strong winds, significant thunderstorms, flooding and drought, could negatively impact operations, including our ability to provide energy safely, reliably and profitably and our ability to complete construction, expansion or refurbishment of facilities as planned;•Acts of sabotage, terrorism or other malicious attacks.  Damage to our facilities due to deliberate acts could lead to outages or other adverse effects;•Operating hazards.  Operating hazards such as leaks, mechanical problems and accidents, including fires or explosions could impact employee and public safety, reliability and customer confidence;•Equipment and processes.  Breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, unavailability or increased cost of equipment, and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency could negatively impact our results of operations;•Disrupted transmission and distribution.  We depend on transmission and distribution facilities, including those operated by unaffiliated parties, to deliver the electricity and gas that we sell to our retail and wholesale customers.  If transmission is interrupted physically, mechanically, or with cyber means, our ability to sell or deliver utility services and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered;•Natural gas supply for generation and distribution.  Our regulated utilities and non-regulated entities purchase natural gas from a number of suppliers for our generating facilities and for distribution to our customers.  Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by the lack of availability and cost of natural gas, and disruptions in the delivery of natural gas due to various factors, including but not limited to, transportation delays, labor relations, weather and environmental regulations;•Replacement power.  The cost of supplying or securing replacement power during scheduled and unscheduled outages of generation facilities could negatively impact our results of operations;•Governmental permits. The inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals along with the cost of complying with or satisfying conditions imposed upon such approvals could negatively impact our ability to operateand our results of operations;•Operational limitations.  Operational limitations imposed by environmental and other regulatory requirements and contractual agreements, including those that restrict the timing of generation plant scheduled outages, could negatively impact our results of operations;•Increased costs.  Increased capital and operating costs to comply with increasingly stringent laws and regulations; unexpected engineering, environmental and geological problems; and unanticipated cost overruns could negatively impact our results of operations;•Labor and labor relations.  The cost of recruiting and retaining skilled technical labor or the unavailability of such resources could have a negative impact on our operations.  Our ability to transition and replace our retirement-eligible utility employees is a risk; at December 31, 2020, approximately 23% of our Electric Utilities and Gas Utilities employees were eligible for regular or early retirement.  Our ability to avoid or minimize supply interruptions, work stoppages and labor disputes is also a risk; approximately 25% of our employees are represented by unions;•Public opposition.  Opposition by members of public or special-interest groups could negatively impact our ability to operate our businesses; and    The ongoing operation of our business involves the risks described above, in addition to risks associated with threats to our overall business model, such as electrification initiatives.  Any of these risks could cause us to experience negative financial results and damage to our reputation and public confidence.  These risks could cause us to incur significant costs or be unable to deliver energy and/or operate below expected capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues or cause us to incur higher operating and maintenance costs and penalties.  While we maintain insurance and obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance and our rights under contracts, warranties or performance guarantees may not be timely or adequate to cover lost revenues, increased expenses, liability or liquidated damage payments.27Table of ContentsCyberattacks, terrorism, or other malicious acts targeting our key technology systems could disrupt our operations, or lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information.To effectively operate our business, we rely upon a sophisticated electronic control system, information and operation technology systems and network infrastructure to generate, distribute and deliver energy, and collect and retain sensitive information including personal information about our customers and employees.  Cyberattacks, terrorism or other malicious acts targeting electronic control systems could result in a full or partial disruption of our electric and/or gas operations.  Attacks targeting other key technology systems, including our third-party vendors’ information systems, could further add to a full or partial disruption of our operations.  Any disruption of these operations could result in a loss of service to customers and associated revenues, as well as significant expense to repair damages and remedy security breaches.  In addition, any theft, loss and/or fraudulent use of customer, shareowner, employee or proprietary data could subject us to significant litigation, liability and costs, as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators, among others.We have instituted security measures and safeguards to protect our operational systems and information technology assets, including certain safeguards required by FERC.  Despite our implementation of security measures and safeguards, all of our technology systems may still be vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access.Weather conditions, including the impacts of climate change, may cause fluctuation in customer usage.Our utility businesses are seasonal businesses and weather conditions and patterns can have a material impact on our operating performance.  To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers’ energy use could increase or decrease.  Demand for electricity is typically greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating, respectively.  Demand for natural gas depends heavily upon winter-weather patterns throughout our service territory and a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating season.  Accordingly, our utility operations have historically generated lower revenues and income when weather conditions are cooler than normal in the summer and warmer than normal in the winter.  Demand for natural gas is also impacted by summer weather patterns that are cooler than normal and provide higher than normal precipitation; both of which can reduce natural gas demand for irrigation.  Unusually mild summers and winters, therefore, could have an adverse effect on our financial operating results, including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.FINANCIAL RISKSA sub-investment grade credit rating could impact our ability to access capital markets.Our issuer credit rating is Baa2 (Stable outlook) by Moody’s; BBB+ (Stable outlook) by S&P; and BBB+ (Stable outlook) by Fitch.  Reduction of our investment grade credit ratings could impair our ability to refinance or repay our existing debt and complete new financings on reasonable terms, if at all.  A credit rating downgrade, particularly to sub-investment grade, could also result in counterparties requiring us to post additional collateral under existing or new contracts.  In addition, a ratings downgrade would increase our interest expense under some of our existing debt obligations, including borrowings under our credit facilities, potentially significantly increasing our cost of capital and other associated operating costs which may not be recoverable through existing regulatory rate structures and contracts with customers.Our use of derivative financial instruments as hedges against commodity prices and financial market risks could result in material financial losses.We use various financial and physical derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps to manage commodity price and interest rate risks.  The timing of the recognition of gains or losses on these economic hedges in accordance with GAAP does not always match up with the gains or losses on the commodities being hedged.  For Black Hills Energy Services under the Choice Gas Program, and in certain instances within our regulated Utilities where unrealized and realized gains and losses from derivative instruments are not approved for regulatory accounting treatment, fluctuating commodity prices may cause fluctuations in reported financial results due to mark-to-market accounting treatment.  To the extent that we hedge our commodity price and interest rate exposures, we forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in our favor.  In addition, even though they are closely monitored by management, our hedging activities can result in losses.  Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the hedge arrangement, the hedge is economically imperfect, commodity prices or interest rates move unfavorably related to our physical or financial positions, or hedging policies and procedures are not followed.Additionally, our exchange-traded futures contracts are subject to futures margin posting requirements.  To the extent we are unable to meet these requirements, this could have a significant impact on our business by reducing our ability to execute derivative transactions to reduce commodity price uncertainty and to protect cash flows.  Requirements to post collateral may cause significant liquidity issues by reducing our ability to use cash for investment or other corporate purposes, or may require us to increase our level of debt.  Further, a requirement for our counterparties to post collateral could result in additional costs being passed on to us, thereby decreasing our profitability.28Table of ContentsWe have a holding company corporate structure with multiple subsidiaries.  Corporate dividends and debt payments are dependent upon cash distributions to the holding company from the subsidiaries.As a holding company, our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets.  Our operating cash flow and ability to service our indebtedness depend on the operating cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends or advances.  Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available for that purpose, whether by dividends or otherwise.  In addition, each subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to us depends on any applicable contractual or regulatory restrictions that may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of cash, working capital, equity or debt service funds.There is no assurance as to the amount, if any, of future dividends to the holding company because these subsidiaries depend on our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition and are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.  See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and Note 9 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these restrictions and their impact on our liquidity.We may be unable to obtain financing on reasonable terms needed to refinance debt, fund planned capital expenditures or otherwise execute our operating strategy.Our ability to execute our operating strategy is highly dependent upon our access to capital.  Historically, we have addressed our liquidity needs (including funds required to make scheduled principal and interest payments, refinance debt, pay dividends and fund working capital and planned capital expenditures) with operating cash flow, borrowings under credit facilities, proceeds of debt and equity offerings and proceeds from asset sales.  Our ability to access the capital markets and the costs and terms of available financing depend on many factors, including changes in our credit ratings, changes in the federal or state regulatory environment affecting energy companies, volatility in commodity or electricity prices and general economic and market conditions.In addition, because we are a holding company and our utility assets are owned by our subsidiaries, if we are unable to adequately access the credit markets, we could be required to take additional measures designed to ensure that our utility subsidiaries are adequately capitalized to provide safe and reliable service.  Possible additional measures would be evaluated in the context of then-prevailing market conditions, prudent financial management and any applicable regulatory requirements.National and regional economic conditions may cause increased counterparty credit risk, late payments and uncollectible accounts.A future recession or pandemic, if one occurs, may lead to an increase in late payments or non-payment from retail residential, commercial and industrial utility customers, as well as from our non-utility customers.  If late payments and uncollectible accounts increase, earnings and cash flows from our continuing operations may be reduced.We may be unable to obtain insurance coverage, and the coverage we currently have may not apply or may be insufficient to cover a significant loss.Our ability to obtain insurance, as well as the cost of such insurance, could be impacted by developments affecting the insurance industry and the financial condition of insurers.  Additionally insurance providers could deny coverage or decline to extend coverage under the same or similar terms that are presently available to us.  A loss for which we are not adequately insured could materially affect our financial results.  The coverage we currently have in place may not apply to a particular loss, or it may not be sufficient to cover all liabilities to which the Company may be subject, including liability and losses associated with wildfire, natural gas and gas storage field explosions, cyber-security breaches, environmental hazards and natural disasters.Market performance or changes in key valuation assumptions could require us to make significant unplanned contributions to our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans.  Assumptions related to interest rates, expected return on investments, mortality and other key actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on our funding requirements and the expense recognized related to these plans.  An adverse change to key assumptions associated with our defined benefit retirement plans may require significant unplanned contributions to the plans which could adversely affect our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.29Table of ContentsCosts associated with our healthcare plans and other benefits could increase significantly.The costs of providing healthcare benefits to our employees and retirees have increased substantially in recent years.  We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs related to healthcare plans for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise.  Significant regulatory developments have required, and likely will continue to require, changes to our current employee benefit plans and supporting administrative processes. Our electric and gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding.  Within our utility rates we have generally recovered the cost of providing employee benefits.  As benefit costs continue to rise, there is no assurance that the state utility commissions will allow recovery of these increased costs.  The rising employee benefit costs, or inadequate recovery of such costs, may adversely affect our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow, or liquidity.PANDEMIC RISKOur business operations, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.We have responded to the global pandemic of COVID-19 by taking steps to mitigate the potential risks to us posed by its spread. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a limited net financial impact on our business operations, financial condition and cash flows.  In particular, we experienced:•Increased allowance for credit losses and bad debt expense due to anticipated customer non-payment as a result of suspended disconnections;•Increased costs due to sequestration of mission-critical and essential employees;•Lower commercial and certain transport volumes partially offset by higher electric and natural gas residential usage;•Waived customer late payment fees;•Reduced availability of our employees;•Increased costs for personal protection equipment and cleaning supplies; •Minimal disruptions receiving the materials and supplies necessary to maintain operations and continue executing our capital investment plan;•Minimal impacts to the availability of our contractors;•Minimal decline in the funded status of our pension plan;•Minimal interest expense increase due to disruptions in the Commercial Paper markets; and•Reduced training, travel, and outside services related expenses.Should the COVID-19 pandemic continue for a prolonged period or impact the areas we serve more significantly than it has to date, our business operations, financial condition and cash flows could be impacted in more significant ways.  In addition to exacerbating the impacts described above, we could experience:•Adverse impacts on our strategic business plans, growth strategy and capital investments;•Increased adverse impacts to electricity and natural gas demand from our customers, particularly from commercial and industrial customers;•Further reduction in the availability of our employees and contractors;•Increased costs as a result of our preventative measures, such as sequestration of essential employees and facility cleaning services; •Increased allowance for credit losses and bad debt expense as a result of delayed or non-payment from our customers, both of which could be magnified by Federal or state government legislation that requires us to extend suspensions of disconnections for non-payment;•Delays and disruptions in the availability, timely delivery and cost of materials and components used in our operations;•Disruptions in the commercial operation dates of certain projects impacting qualification criteria for certain tax credits and triggering potential damages under our power purchase agreements;•Deterioration of the credit quality of our counterparties, including gas commodity contract counterparties, power purchase agreement counterparties, contractors or retail customers, that could result in credit losses;•Impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets;•Adverse impacts on our ability to construct and operate facilities;•Inability to meet the requirements of the covenants in our existing credit facilities, including covenants regarding Consolidated Indebtedness to Capitalization Ratio;•Deterioration in our financial metrics or the business environment that adversely impacts our credit ratings;•Delay in the permitting process of certain development projects, affecting the timing of final investment decisions and start dates of construction;•Adverse impact on our liquidity position and cost of and ability to access funds from financial institutions and capital markets; and•Delays in our ability to change rates through regulatory proceedings.30Table of ContentsTo date, we have experienced limited impacts to our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or business plans. However, the situation remains fluid and it is difficult to predict with certainty the potential impact of COVID-19 on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows"
13,BKH,BLACK HILLS CORP,2020-02-14,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSOPERATING RISKSThe nature of our business subjects us to a number of uncertainties and risks.  Risks that may adversely affect the business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows are described below.  These risk factors and other risk factors that we discuss in our periodic reports filed with the SEC should be considered for a better understanding of our Company. Our continued success is dependent on execution of our strategic business plans and growth strategy.Our results of operations depend, in significant part, on our ability to execute our strategic business plans and growth strategy.  Technology advancements, disruptive forces and innovations in the marketplace and changing business or regulatory conditions may negatively impact our current plans and strategies.  An inability to successfully and timely adapt to changing conditions and execute our strategic plans and growth strategy could materially affect our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.   29Table of ContentsWe may be subject to unfavorable federal and state regulatory outcomes.Our regulated Electric and Gas Utilities are subject to cost-of-service regulation and earnings oversight from federal and eight state utility commissions.  This regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of desired earnings levels.  Our retail electric and gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding.  The rates that we are allowed to charge may or may not match our related costs and allowed return on invested capital at any given time.  While rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that our various regulatory authorities will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will result in full recovery of our costs and the allowed return on invested capital.  In addition, rate decisions could be influenced by many factors, including general economic conditions and the political environment.Each of our Electric and Gas Utilities are permitted to recover certain costs (such as increased fuel and purchased power costs) outside of a base rate review.  To the extent we are able to pass through such costs to our customers, and the state utility commission subsequently determines that such costs should not have been paid by the customers, we may be required to refund such costs.  Any such costs not recovered through rates, or any such refund, could adversely affect financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.We may be subject to future laws, regulations, or actions associated with fossil-fuel generation and GHG emissions.We own and operate regulated and unregulated electric power plants that burn fossil fuels (natural gas and coal) and a surface mine that extracts and sells coal.  We also purchase and deliver natural gas to our customers.  These business activities are subject to evolving public concern regarding fossil fuels, GHG emissions (such as carbon dioxide and methane) and their impact on the climate.Increased rules and regulations associated with fossil fuels and GHG emissions could result in the impairment or retirement of some of our existing or future transmission, distribution, generation and storage facilities or coal mine.  Further, these rules could create the need to purchase or build clean-energy fuel sources to fulfill obligations to our customers.  These actions could also result in increased operating costs which could adversely impact customers and our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity. Our financial performance depends on the successful management of our facilities operations, including ongoing operation, construction, expansion, and refurbishment. Operation, construction, expansion and refurbishment of electric generating facilities, electric and natural gas transmission and distribution systems, natural gas storage facilities, and a coal mine involve risks that could result in fires, explosions, property damage and personal injury, including death.  These risks include:•Inherent dangers.  Electricity and natural gas are dangerous for employees and the general public; contact with power lines, natural gas pipelines, electrical or natural gas service facilities and equipment can result in fires and explosions, causing significant property damage and personal injuries, including death;•Weather, natural conditions and disasters.  Severe weather events could negatively impact operations, including our ability to provide energy safely and reliably and our ability to complete construction, expansion or refurbishment of facilities as planned.  Extreme natural conditions and other disasters such as wind, lightning, flooding and winter storms, can cause wildfires, electric transmission or distribution pole failures, natural gas pipeline interruptions, outages, property damage and personal injury;•Operating hazards.  Operating hazards such as leaks, mechanical problems and accidents, including fires or explosions could impact employee and public safety, reliability and customer confidence;•Labor and labor relations.  The cost of recruiting and retaining skilled technical labor or the unavailability of such resources could have a negative impact on our operations.  Our ability to transition and replace our retirement-eligible utility employees is a risk; at December 31, 2019, approximately 25% of our Electric Utilities and Gas Utilities employees were eligible for regular or early retirement.  Our ability to avoid or minimize supply interruptions, work stoppages and labor disputes is also a risk; approximately 25% of our employees are represented by a total of eight collective bargaining agreements. 30Table of Contents•Equipment and processes.  Breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, the unavailability or increased cost of equipment, and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency could negatively impact our results of operations.  New plants may employ recently developed and technologically complex equipment, including newer environmental emission control technology.•Disrupted transmission and distribution.  We depend on transmission and distribution facilities, including those operated by unaffiliated parties, to deliver the electricity and gas that we sell to our retail and wholesale customers.  If transmission is interrupted physically, mechanically, or with cyber means, our ability to sell or deliver product and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered;•Natural gas supply for generation and distribution.  Our utilities purchase natural gas from a number of suppliers for our generating facilities and for distribution to our customers.  Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by the lack of availability and cost of natural gas, and disruptions in the delivery of natural gas due to various factors, including but not limited to, transportation delays, labor relations, weather and environmental regulations, which could limit our utilities’ ability to operate their facilities;•Replacement power.  The cost of supplying or securing replacement power during scheduled and unscheduled outages of generation facilities could negatively impact our results of operations;•Governmental permits.  The inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals along with the cost of complying with or satisfying conditions imposed upon such approvals could negatively impact our ability to operate and our results of operations;•Operational limitations.  Operational limitations imposed by environmental and other regulatory requirements and contractual agreements, including those that restrict the timing of generation plant scheduled outages, could negatively impact our results of operations;•Increased costs.  Increased capital and operating costs to comply with increasingly stringent environmental and pipeline safety laws and regulations; unexpected engineering, environmental and geological problems; and unanticipated cost overruns could negatively impact our results of operations;•Public opposition.  Opposition by members of public or special-interest groups could negatively impact our ability to operate our businesses.•Disruption in the functioning of our information technology and network infrastructure which is vulnerable to disability, failures and unauthorized access.  If our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions.    The ongoing operation of our business involves the risks described above, in addition to risks associated with threats to our overall business model, such as electrification initiatives.  Any of these risks could cause us to experience negative financial results and damage to our reputation and public confidence.  These risks could cause us to incur significant costs or be unable to deliver energy and/or operate below expected capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues or cause us to incur higher operating and maintenance costs and penalties.  While we maintain insurance and obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance and our rights under contracts, warranties or performance guarantees may not be timely or adequate to cover lost revenues, increased expenses, liability or liquidated damage payments.Our energy production, transmission and distribution activities, and our storage facilities for our natural gas involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other catastrophic events.Inherent in our businesses are a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, blowouts, fires, releases of hazardous materials, explosions and operational problems.  Many of our transmission and distribution assets are located near populated residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites.These hazards could result in injury or loss of human life, cause environmental pollution, significantly damage property or natural resources or impair our ability to operate our facilities.  While we maintain liability and property insurance coverage, such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles.  The occurrence of any of these events may not be fully covered by our insurance and could have a material adverse effect on our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity. 31Table of ContentsCustomer growth and usage in our service territories may fluctuate with current economic conditions, emerging technologies or responses to price increases.Our financial operating results are impacted by demand in our service territories.  Customer growth and usage may be impacted by a number of factors, including the voluntary reduction of consumption of electricity and natural gas by our customers in response to increases in prices and energy efficiency programs, economic conditions impacting customers’ disposable income and the use of distributed generation resources or other emerging technologies.  Continued technological improvements may make customer and third-party distributed generation and energy storage systems, including fuel cells, micro-turbines, wind turbines, solar cells and batteries, more cost effective and feasible for our customers.  If more customers utilize their own generation, demand for energy from us would decline.  Such developments could affect the price of energy and delivery of energy, require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands and could make portions of our electric system power supply and transmission and/or distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives.  Each of these factors could materially affect our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.Cyberattacks, terrorism, or other malicious acts could disrupt our operations, or lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information.To effectively operate our business, we rely upon a sophisticated electronic control system, SCADA, information technology systems and network infrastructure to collect and retain sensitive information including personal information about our customers and employees.  Cyberattacks, terrorism or other malicious acts targeting electronic control systems could result in a full or partial disruption of our electric and/or gas operations.  Attacks targeting other key information technology systems, including our third-party vendors’ information systems, could further add to a full or partial disruption of our operations.  Any disruption of these operations could result in a loss of service to customers and a significant decrease in revenues, as well as significant expense to repair system damage and remedy security breaches.  Any theft, loss and/or fraudulent use of customer, shareowner, employee or proprietary data could subject us to significant litigation, liability and costs, as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators, among others.We have instituted security measures and safeguards to protect our operational systems and information technology assets, including certain safeguards required by FERC.  The security measures and safeguards we have implemented may not always be effective.  Despite our implementation of security measures and safeguards, all of our information technology systems may be vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized accessRisks associated with deployment of capital may impact our ability to execute our business plans and growth strategy.We have significant capital investment programs planned for the next five years.  The successful execution of our capital investment strategy depends on, or could be affected by, a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to: extreme weather conditions, effective management of projects, availability of qualified construction personnel including contractors, changes in commodity and other prices, governmental approvals and permitting and regulatory cost recovery.  Weather conditions may cause fluctuation in customer usage as well as service disruptions.Our utility businesses are seasonal businesses and weather conditions and patterns can have a material impact on our operating performance.  Demand for electricity is typically greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating, respectively.  Demand for natural gas depends heavily upon winter-weather patterns throughout our service territory and a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating season.  Accordingly, our utility operations have historically generated lower revenues and income when weather conditions are cooler than normal in the summer and warmer than normal in the winter.  Demand for natural gas is also impacted by summer weather patterns that are cooler than normal and provide higher than normal precipitation; both of which can reduce natural gas demand for irrigation.  Unusually mild summers and winters, therefore, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Our businesses are located in areas that could be subject to severe weather events such as snow and ice storms, tornadoes, strong winds, significant thunderstorms, flooding and drought.  These events could result in lost operating revenues due to outages, property damage, including inoperable generation facilities and downed transmission and distribution lines, and storm restoration activities.  We may not be able to recover the costs incurred following these weather events resulting in a negative impact on our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity. 32Table of ContentsWe may be subject to increased risks of regulatory penalties.Business activities in the energy sector are heavily regulated, primarily by agencies of the federal government.  Many agencies  employ mandatory civil penalty structures for regulatory violations.  The FERC, NERC, CFTC, EPA, OSHA, SEC and MSHA may impose significant civil and criminal penalties to enforce compliance requirements relative to our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.Certain Federal laws provide special protection to certain designated animal species.  These laws and any state equivalents provide for significant civil and criminal penalties for non-permitted activities that result in harm to or harassment of certain protected animals, including damage to their habitats.  If such species are located in an area in which we conduct operations, or if additional species in those areas become subject to protection, our operations and development projects, particularly transmission, generation, wind and pipeline projects, could be restricted or delayed, or we could be required to implement expensive mitigation measures.Municipal governments may seek to limit or deny our franchise privileges.Municipal governments within our utility service territories possess the power of condemnation and could establish a municipal utility within a portion of our current service territories by limiting or denying franchise privileges for our operations and exercising powers of condemnation over all or part of our utility assets within municipal boundaries.  We regularly engage in negotiations on renewals of franchise agreements with our municipal governments.  We have from time to time faced challenges or ballot initiatives on franchise renewals.  To date, we have been successful in resolving or defending each of these challenges.  Although condemnation is a process that is subject to constitutional protections requiring just and fair compensation, as with any judicial procedure, the outcome is uncertain.  If a municipality sought to pursue this course of action, we cannot assure that we would secure adequate recovery of our investment in assets subject to condemnation.  We also cannot quantify the impact that such action would have on the remainder of our business operations.FINANCING RISKSA sub-investment grade credit rating could impact our ability to access capital markets.Our issuer credit rating is Baa2 (Stable outlook) by Moody’s; BBB+ (Stable outlook) by S&P; and BBB+ (Stable outlook) by Fitch.  Reduction of our credit ratings could impair our ability to refinance or repay our existing debt and complete new financings on reasonable terms, if at all.  A credit rating downgrade, particularly to sub-investment grade, could also result in counterparties requiring us to post additional collateral under existing or new contracts.  In addition, a ratings downgrade would increase our interest expense under some of our existing debt obligations, including borrowings under our credit facilities, potentially significantly increasing our cost of capital and other associated operating costs.Derivatives regulations could impede our ability to manage business and financial risks by restricting our use of derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates.Dodd-Frank contains significant derivatives regulations, including a requirement that certain transactions be cleared resulting in a requirement to post cash collateral (commonly referred to as “margin”) for such transactions.  Dodd-Frank provides for a potential exception from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end-users such as utilities and it includes a number of defined terms that will be used in determining how this exception applies to particular derivative transactions and the parties to those transactions.We use derivative instruments for our hedging activities for our Gas and Electric Utilities’ operations.  We may also use interest rate derivative instruments to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations.  As a result of Dodd-Frank regulations promulgated by the CFTC, we may be required to post collateral for certain swap transactions we enter into.  In addition, our exchange-traded futures contracts are subject to futures margin posting requirements, which could have a significant impact on our business by reducing our ability to execute derivative transactions to reduce commodity price uncertainty and to protect cash flows.  Requirements to post collateral may cause significant liquidity issues by reducing our ability to use cash for investment or other corporate purposes, or may require us to increase our level of debt.  In addition, a requirement for our counterparties to post collateral could result in additional costs being passed on to us, thereby decreasing our profitability. 33Table of ContentsOur hedging activities that are designed to protect against commodity price and financial market risks may cause fluctuations in reported financial results due to mark-to-market accounting treatment.We use various financial contracts and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps to manage commodity price and financial market risks.  The timing of the recognition of gains or losses on these economic hedges in accordance with GAAP does not always match up with the gains or losses on the commodities being hedged.  Fluctuating commodity prices could have a negative effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Our use of derivative financial instruments could result in material financial losses.From time to time, we have sought to limit a portion of the potential adverse effects resulting from changes in commodity prices and interest rates by using derivative financial instruments and other hedging mechanisms.  To the extent that we hedge our commodity price and interest rate exposures, we forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in our favor.  In addition, even though they are closely monitored by management, our hedging activities can result in losses.  Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the hedge arrangement, the hedge is economically imperfect, commodity prices or interest rates move unfavorably related to our physical or financial positions, or hedging policies and procedures are not followed.Market performance or changes in key valuation assumptions could require us to make significant unplanned contributions to our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans.  Assumptions related to interest rates, expected return on investments, mortality and other key actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on our funding requirements and the expense recognized related to these plans.   An adverse change to key assumptions associated with our defined benefit retirement plans may require significant unplanned contributions to the plans which could adversely affect our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.We have a holding company corporate structure with multiple subsidiaries.  Corporate dividends and debt payments are dependent upon cash distributions to the holding company from the subsidiaries.As a holding company, our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets.  Our operating cash flow and ability to service our indebtedness depend on the operating cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends or advances.  Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available for that purpose, whether by dividends or otherwise.  In addition, each subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to us depends on any applicable contractual or regulatory restrictions that may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of cash, working capital, equity or debt service funds.There is no assurance as to the amount, if any, of future dividends because they depend on our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition and are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.  See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these restrictions and their impact on our liquidity.We may be unable to obtain financing on reasonable terms needed to refinance debt, fund planned capital expenditures or otherwise execute our operating strategy.Our ability to execute our operating strategy is highly dependent upon our access to capital.  Historically, we have addressed our liquidity needs (including funds required to make scheduled principal and interest payments, refinance debt, pay dividends and fund working capital and planned capital expenditures) with operating cash flow, borrowings under credit facilities, proceeds of debt and equity offerings and proceeds from asset sales.  Our ability to access the capital markets and the costs and terms of available financing depend on many factors, including changes in our credit ratings, changes in the federal or state regulatory environment affecting energy companies, volatility in commodity or electricity prices and general economic and market conditions.In addition, because we are a holding company and our utility assets are owned by our subsidiaries, if we are unable to adequately access the credit markets, we could be required to take additional measures designed to ensure that our utility subsidiaries are adequately capitalized to provide safe and reliable service.  Possible additional measures would be evaluated in the context of then-prevailing market conditions, prudent financial management and any applicable regulatory requirements. 34Table of ContentsNational and regional economic conditions may cause increased counterparty credit risk, late payments and uncollectible accounts.A future recession, if one occurs, may lead to an increase in late payments from retail, commercial and industrial utility customers, as well as from our non-utility customers.  If late payments and uncollectible accounts increase, earnings and cash flows from our continuing operations may be reduced.Our ability to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers.  Our insurance coverage may not provide protection against all significant losses.Our ability to obtain insurance, as well as the cost of such insurance, could be impacted by developments affecting insurance businesses, international, national, state or local events, as well as the financial condition of insurers.  Insurance coverage may not continue to be available at all, or at rates or on terms similar to those presently available to us.  A loss for which we are not fully insured could materially and adversely affect our financial results.  Our insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which the Company may be subject, including but not limited to environmental hazards, fire-related liability from natural events or inadequate facility maintenance, distribution property losses, cyber-security risks and dangers that exist in the gathering and transportation of gas in pipelines.Costs associated with our healthcare plans and other benefits could increase significantly.The costs of providing healthcare benefits to our employees and retirees have increased substantially in recent years.  We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs related to healthcare plans for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise.  Significant regulatory developments have, and likely will continue to, require changes to our current employee benefit plans and in our administrative and accounting processes. Our electric and gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding.  Within our utility rates we have generally recovered the cost of providing employee benefits.  As benefit costs continue to rise, there can be no assurance that the state public utility commissions will allow recovery.  The increasing cost, or inadequate recovery of, rising employee benefit costs may adversely affect our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow, or liquidity.An effective system of internal control may not be maintained, leading to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management to make an assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal controls.  Our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of these controls.  During their assessment of these controls, management or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify areas of weakness in control design or effectiveness, which may lead to the conclusion that a material weakness in internal control exists.  Any control deficiencies we identify in the future could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis, which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports or have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business or access sources of liquidity.A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met.  If we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, market perception of our business, operating results and stock price could be adversely affected.ENVIRONMENTAL RISKSDevelopments in federal and state laws concerning GHG regulations and air emissions relating to climate could materially increase our generation costs and render some of our generating units uneconomical to operate and maintain.To the extent climate change occurs, our businesses could be adversely impacted.  Warmer temperatures during the heating season in our utility service territories, or cooler temperatures during the cooling season in our electric service territories could adversely affect financial results through lower natural gas volumes delivered, lower MWh sold and associated lower revenues. 35Table of ContentsWe own and operate regulated and non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants in Colorado, South Dakota and Wyoming.  Developments under federal and state laws and regulations governing air emissions from fossil-fuel generating plants may result in more stringent emission limitations, which could have a material impact on our costs of operations.  Various pending or final state and EPA regulations that will impact our facilities are also discussed in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the section “Environmental Matters”.There is uncertainty surrounding current climate regulation due to legal challenges, new federal climate legislation anticipated in the future, or state climate legislation and regulation.  We cannot definitively estimate the effect of GHG legislation or regulation on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.New or more stringent regulations or other energy efficiency requirements could require us to incur significant additional costs relating to, among other things, the installation of additional emission control equipment, the acceleration of capital expenditures, the purchase of additional emissions allowances or offsets, the acquisition or development of additional energy supply from renewable resources, the closure or reduction of load of coal-fired power generation facilities and potential increased load of our combined cycle natural gas-fired generation units.  To the extent our regulated fossil-fuel generating plants are included in rate base we will attempt to recover costs associated with complying with emission standards or other requirements.  We will also attempt to recover the emission compliance costs of our non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants from utility and other purchasers of the power generated by those non-regulated power plants.  Any unrecovered costs could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, future changes in environmental regulations governing air emissions could render some of our power generating units more expensive or uneconomical to operate and maintain; this could cause those generating units to be de-commissioned, potentially resulting in impairment costs.  We will attempt to recover any remaining asset value; however, any unrecovered costs could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.The costs to achieve or maintain compliance with existing or future governmental laws, regulations or requirements, or failure to comply, could increase significantly.Our business segments are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous waste.  These laws and regulations may result in increased capital, operating and other costs.  These laws and regulations generally require the business segments to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals.  Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may require significant expenditures, including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising from contaminated properties.  Failure to comply with environmental regulations may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive measures affecting operating assets.The business segments may not be successful in recovering capital and operating costs incurred to comply with new environmental regulations through existing regulatory rate structures and contracts with customers.  More stringent environmental laws or regulations could result in additional costs of operation for existing facilities or impede the development of new facilities.  Although it is not expected that the costs to comply with current environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on the business segments’ financial position, results of operations or cash flows, future environmental compliance costs could have a significant negative impact.The characteristics of coal may make it difficult for coal users to comply with various environmental standards related to coal combustion or utilization.Future regulations may require further reductions in emissions of mercury, hazardous pollutants, SO2, NOx, volatile organic compounds, particulate matter and GHG, which are released into the air when coal is burned.  These requirements could require the installation of costly emission control technology or the implementation of other measures.Coal competes with other energy sources, such as natural gas, wind, solar and hydropower.  The EPA was directed to repeal, revise and replace the CPP rule.  At this time, it is not known what effect this will have on coal as a domestic energy source, and could have a significant impact on our mining operations.Existing or proposed legislation focusing on emissions enacted by the United States or individual states could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative for our customers and could impose a tax or fee on the producer of the coal.  If our customers decrease the volume of coal they purchase from us or switch to alternative fuels as a result of existing or future environmental regulations aimed at reducing emissions, our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity could be adversely impacted. 36Table of Contents"
4,BKH,BLACK HILLS CORP,2019-02-19,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSThe nature of our business subjects us to a number of uncertainties and risks.  The following risk factors and other risk factors that we discuss in our periodic reports filed with the SEC should be considered for a better understanding of our Company.  These important factors and other matters discussed herein could cause our future actual results or outcomes to differ materially.OPERATING RISKSOur financial performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities.  If the risks involved in our operations are not appropriately managed or mitigated, our operations may not be successful and this could adversely affect our results of operations.Operating electric generating facilities, the coal mine and electric and natural gas transmission and distribution systems involves risks, including:•Disrupted transmission and distribution.  We depend on transmission and distribution facilities, including those operated by unaffiliated parties, to deliver the electricity and gas that we sell to our retail and wholesale customers.  If transmission is interrupted physically, mechanically, or with cyber means, our ability to sell or deliver product and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered; 32•Interruptions to supply of fuel and other commodities used in generation and distribution.  Our utilities purchase fuel from a number of suppliers.  Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the delivery of fuel due to various factors, including but not limited to, transportation delays, labor relations, weather and environmental regulations, which could limit our utilities’ ability to operate their facilities;•Electricity is dangerous for employees and the general public should they come in contact with power lines or electrical service facilities and equipment.  Natural conditions and other disasters such as wind, lightning and winter storms can cause wildfires, pole failures and associated property damage and outages;•Operating hazards such as leaks, mechanical problems and accidents, including explosions affecting our natural gas distribution system, which could impact public safety, reliability and customer confidence;•Operational limitations imposed by environmental and other regulatory requirements;•Breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, including those operated by PacifiCorp at the Wyodak Plant;•Labor relations.  Approximately 25% of our employees are represented by a total of eight collective bargaining agreements;•Our ability to transition and replace our retirement-eligible utility employees.  At December 31, 2018, approximately 18% of our Electric Utilities and Gas Utilities employees were eligible for regular or early retirement;•Inability to recruit and retain skilled technical labor; and•Disruption in the functioning of our information technology and network infrastructure which are vulnerable to disability, failures and unauthorized access.  If our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions.Changes in the interpretation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) could adversely affect us.On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law, significantly reforming the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.  The TCJA, among other things, includes a decrease in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures, and modifies or repeals many business deductions and credits.  The new tax law contains several provisions that impacted our 2017 and 2018 financial results. The TCJA includes provisions limiting interest deductibility in certain circumstances.  While we expect to maintain deductibility of interest expense, the lower tax rate reduces the tax benefits associated with interest deductibility on holding company debt that is not recovered in the regulatory construct.If there are future changes and amendments to the TCJA, and if we are unable to obtain reasonable outcomes with our utility regulators in passing future benefits of the TCJA back to customers, or if our interpretations on the provisions of depreciation or interest deductibility in the TCJA change, our results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be materially impacted. Construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve significant risks which could reduce profitability.The construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve many risks, including:•The inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals along with the cost of complying with or satisfying conditions imposed upon such approvals;•Contractual restrictions upon the timing of scheduled outages;•The cost of supplying or securing replacement power during scheduled and unscheduled outages;•The unavailability or increased cost of equipment; 33•The cost of recruiting and retaining or the unavailability of skilled labor;•Supply interruptions, work stoppages and labor disputes;•Increased capital and operating costs to comply with increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations;•Opposition by members of public or special-interest groups;•Weather interferences;•Availability and cost of fuel supplies;•Unexpected engineering, environmental and geological problems; and•Unanticipated cost overruns.The ongoing operation of our facilities involves many of the risks described above, in addition to risks relating to the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency.  New plants may employ recently developed and technologically complex equipment, including newer environmental emission control technology.  Any of these risks could cause us to operate below expected capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues, increase expenses or cause us to incur higher operating and maintenance costs and penalties.  While we maintain insurance, obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance and our rights under warranties or performance guarantees may not be timely or adequate to cover lost revenues, increased expenses, liability or liquidated damage payments.Operating results can be adversely affected by variations from normal weather conditions.Our utility businesses are seasonal businesses and weather patterns can have a material impact on our operating performance.  Demand for electricity is typically greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating, respectively.  Demand for natural gas depends heavily upon winter-weather patterns throughout our service territory and a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating season.  Accordingly, our utility operations have historically generated lower revenues and income when weather conditions are cooler than normal in the summer and warmer than normal in the winter.  Demand for natural gas is also impacted by summer weather patterns that are cooler than normal and provide higher than normal precipitation; both of which can reduce natural gas demand for irrigation.  Unusually mild summers and winters therefore could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Our businesses are located in areas that could be subject to seasonal natural disasters such as severe snow and ice storms, flooding and wildfires.  These events could result in interruption of our business, damage to our property such as power lines and substations, and repair and clean-up costs.  We may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring transmission and distribution property following these natural disasters through a change in our regulated rates thereby resulting in a negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Our Mining operations are subject to operating risks that are beyond our control which could affect our profitability and production levels.  Our surface mining operations could be disrupted or materially affected due to adverse weather or natural disasters such as heavy snow, strong winds, rain or flooding.Prices for some of our products and services as well as a portion of our operating costs are volatile and may cause our revenues and expenses to fluctuate significantly.A portion of our net income is attributable to sales of wholesale and off-system electricity and natural gas.  Energy prices are influenced by many factors outside our control, including, among other things, fuel prices, transmission constraints, supply and demand, weather, general economic conditions, and the rules, regulations and actions of system operators in those markets.  As a result, wholesale power markets may be subject to significant, unpredictable price fluctuations over relatively short periods of time. 34Our Mining operations require reliable supply of replacement parts, explosives, fuel, tires and steel-related products.  If the cost of these increase significantly, or if sources of supplies and mining equipment become unavailable to meet our replacement demands, our productivity and profitability could be lower than our current expectations.Our revenues, results of operations and financial condition are impacted by customer growth and usage in our service territories and may fluctuate with current economic conditions, emerging technologies or responses to price increases.Our revenues, results of operations and financial condition are impacted by demand in our service territories.  Customer growth and usage may be impacted by a number of factors, including the voluntary reduction of consumption of electricity and natural gas by our customers in response to increases in prices and demand-side management programs, economic conditions impacting decreases in customers’ disposable income and the use of distributed generation resources or other emerging technologies.  Continued technological improvements may make customer and third-party distributed generation and energy storage systems, including fuel cells, micro-turbines, wind turbines, solar cells and batteries, more cost effective and feasible for our customers.  If more customers utilize their own generation, demand for energy from us would decline.  Such developments could affect the price of energy and delivery of energy, require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands and could make portions of our electric system power supply and transmission and/or distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives.  Each of these factors could materially affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Our operations rely on storage and transportation assets owned by third parties to satisfy our obligations.Our Electric Utilities, Gas Utilities and Power Generation segments rely on pipeline companies and other owners of gas storage facilities to deliver natural gas to customers, to supply our natural gas-fired power plants and to hedge commodity costs.  If storage capacity is inadequate or transportation is disrupted, our ability to satisfy our obligations may be hindered.  As a result, we may be responsible for damages incurred by our counterparties, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at then-current market rates, or for penalties imposed by state regulatory authorities.Our utilities are subject to pipeline safety and system integrity laws and regulations that may require significant capital expenditures or significant increases in operating costs.Compliance with pipeline safety and system integrity laws and regulations, or future changes in these laws and regulations, may result in increased capital, operating and other costs which may not be recoverable in a timely manner from customers through rates.  Failure to comply may result in fines, penalties, or injunctive measures that would not be recoverable from customers through rates and could result in a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Our energy production, transmission and distribution activities, and our storage facilities for our natural gas involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other catastrophic events that could give rise to additional costs and cause a substantial loss to us.Inherent in our natural gas and electricity transmission and distribution activities, as well as in our transportation and storage of natural gas and our Mining operations, are a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, blowouts, fires, releases of hazardous materials, explosions and operational problems.  These events could impact the safety of employees or others and result in injury or loss of human life, and cause significant damage to property or natural resources (including public lands), environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial financial losses to us.  Particularly for our transmission and distribution lines located near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering areas, the damages resulting from any such events could be substantial.  While we maintain liability and property insurance coverage, such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles.  The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 35Threats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt our businesses, or the businesses of third parties, may impact our operations in unpredictable ways.Terrorist acts or other similar events could harm our businesses by limiting their ability to generate, purchase or transmit power, deliver natural gas and by delaying their development and construction of new generating facilities and capital improvements to existing facilities.  These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair and insure our assets and could adversely affect our operations by contributing to disruption of supplies and markets for natural gas, oil and other fuels.  They could also impair our ability to raise capital by contributing to financial instability and lower economic activity.The implementation of security guidelines and measures and maintenance of insurance, to the extent available, addressing such activities could increase costs.  These types of events could materially adversely affect our financial results.  In addition, these types of events could require significant management attention and resources and could adversely affect our reputation among customers and the public.A cyber attack may disrupt our operations, or lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information and create a potential liability.We use and operate sophisticated control, SCADA, and information technology systems and network infrastructure.  In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we collect and retain sensitive information including personal information about our customers and employees.  Cyber attacks targeting our electronic control systems used at our generating facilities and for electric and gas distribution systems, could result in a full or partial disruption of our electric and/or gas operations.  Cyber attacks targeting other key information technology systems, including our third-party vendors’ information systems, could further add to a full or partial disruption of our operations.  Any disruption of these operations could result in a loss of service to customers and a significant decrease in revenues, as well as significant expense to repair system damage and remedy security breaches.  Any theft, loss and/or fraudulent use of customer, shareowner, employee or proprietary data as a result of a cyber attack could subject us to significant litigation, liability and costs, as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators, among others.We have instituted security measures and safeguards to protect our operational systems and information technology assets, including certain safeguards required by FERC.  The security measures and safeguards we have implemented may not always be effective due to the evolving nature and sophistication of cyber attacks.  Despite our implementation of security measures and safeguards, all of our information technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access, including cyber attacks.  If our information technology systems or our third-party vendors’ systems were to fail or be breached by a cyber attack or a computer virus and be unable to recover in a timely way, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions and sensitive, confidential and other data could be compromised which could have a material adverse effect not only on our financial results, but on our public reputation as well.Increased risks of regulatory penalties could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.Business activities in the energy sector are heavily regulated, primarily by agencies of the federal government.  Agencies that historically sought voluntary compliance, or issued non-monetary sanctions, now employ mandatory civil penalty structures for regulatory violations.  The FERC, NERC, CFTC, EPA, OSHA, SEC and MSHA may impose significant civil and criminal penalties to enforce compliance requirements relative to our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and/or our financial results.Certain Federal laws, including the Migratory Bird Act and the Endangered Species Act, provide special protection to certain designated species.  These laws and any state equivalents provide for significant civil and criminal penalties for non-permitted activities that result in harm to or harassment of certain protected animals, including damage to their habitats.  If such species are located in an area in which we conduct operations, or if additional species in those areas become subject to protection, our operations and development projects, particularly transmission, generation, wind and pipeline projects, could be restricted or delayed, or we could be required to implement expensive mitigation measures. 36Our current or future development and expansion activities may not be successful, which could impair our ability to execute our growth strategy.Execution of our growth plan is dependent on successful ongoing and future development and expansion activities.  We can provide no assurance that we will be able to complete development projects or expansion activities we undertake or continue to develop attractive opportunities for growth.  Factors that could cause our development and expansion activities to be unsuccessful include:•Our inability to obtain required governmental permits;•Our inability to complete capital projects in a timely manner; •Our inability to secure just and reasonable utility rates through regulatory proceedings;•Our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all;•The possibility that one or more credit rating agencies would downgrade our issuer credit rating to below investment grade, thus increasing our cost of doing business;•Our inability to attract and retain management or other key personnel;•Our inability to negotiate acceptable construction, fuel supply, power sales or other material agreements;•Reduced growth in the demand for utility services in the markets we serve;•Changes in federal, state, local or tribal laws and regulations, particularly those which would make it more difficult or costly to fully develop our coal reserves or our power generation capacity;•Fuel prices or fuel supply constraints;•Pipeline capacity and transmission constraints;•Competition within our industry and with producers of competing energy sources; and•Changes in tax rates and policies.UtilitiesRegulatory commissions may refuse to approve some or all of the utility rate increases we have requested or may request in the future, or may determine that amounts passed through to customers were not prudently incurred and therefore are not recoverable.Our regulated Electric Utilities and Gas Utilities are subject to cost-of-service regulation and earnings oversight from federal and state utility commissions.  This regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of desired earnings levels.  Our retail electric and gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding.  The rates that we are allowed to charge may or may not match our related costs and allowed return on invested capital at any given time.  While rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that the state public utility commissions will judge all of our costs, including our direct and allocated borrowing and debt service costs, to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that produce a full recovery of our costs and the return on invested capital allowed by the applicable state public utility commission.To some degree, each of our Electric and Gas Utilities are permitted to recover certain costs (such as increased fuel and purchased power costs) without having to file a rate review.  To the extent we are able to pass through such costs to our customers, and a state public utility commission subsequently determines that such costs should not have been paid by the customers, we may be required to refund such costs.  Any such costs not recovered through rates, or any such refund, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 37If market or other conditions adversely affect operations or require us to make changes to our business strategy in any of our utility businesses, we may be forced to record a non-cash goodwill impairment charge.  Any significant impairment of our goodwill related to these utilities would cause a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net income and shareholders’ equity.We had approximately $1.3 billion of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018.  A substantial portion of the goodwill is related to the SourceGas Acquisition and the Aquila Transaction.  If we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect operations in any of our businesses, we may be forced to record a non-cash impairment charge, which would reduce our reported assets, net income and shareholders’ equity.  Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.  If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill in the period the determination is made.  The testing of goodwill for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions.  These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including:  future business operating performance, changes in economic conditions and interest rates, regulatory, industry or market conditions, changes in business operations, changes in competition or changes in technologies.  Any changes in key assumptions, or actual performance compared with key assumptions, about our business and its future prospects could affect the fair value of one or more business segments, which may result in an impairment charge.Municipal governments may seek to limit or deny franchise privileges which could inhibit our ability to secure adequate recovery of our investment in assets subject to condemnation.Municipal governments within our utility service territories possess the power of condemnation and could establish a municipal utility within a portion of our current service territories by limiting or denying franchise privileges for our operations and exercising powers of condemnation over all or part of our utility assets within municipal boundaries.  Although condemnation is a process that is subject to constitutional protections requiring just and fair compensation, as with any judicial procedure, the outcome is uncertain.  If a municipality sought to pursue this course of action, we cannot assure that we would secure adequate recovery of our investment in assets subject to condemnation.MiningIf the assumptions underlying our reclamation and mine closure obligations are materially inaccurate, our costs could be significantly greater than anticipated or be incurred sooner than anticipated.We conduct surface mining operations that are subject to operations, reclamation and closure standards.  We estimate our total reclamation liabilities based on permit requirements, engineering studies and our engineering expertise related to these requirements.  The estimate of ultimate reclamation liability is reviewed periodically by our management and engineers and by government regulators.  The estimated liability can change significantly if actual costs vary from our original assumptions or if government regulations change significantly.  GAAP requires that asset retirement obligations be recorded as a liability based on fair value, which reflects the present value of the estimated future cash flows.  In estimating future cash flows, we consider the estimated current cost of reclamation and apply inflation rates.  The resulting estimated reclamation obligations could change significantly if actual amounts or the timing of these expenses change significantly from our assumptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.Estimates of the quality and quantity of our coal reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in three-dimensional structural modeling, and any inaccuracies in interpretation or modeling could materially affect the estimated quantity and quality of our reserves.The process of estimating coal reserves is uncertain and requires interpretations and modeling.  Significant inaccuracies in interpretation or modeling could materially affect the quantity and quality of our reserve estimates.  The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of engineering and geological interpretation, conditions encountered during actual reserve recovery and undetected deposit anomalies.  Variance from the assumptions used and drill hole modeling density could result in additions or deletions from our volume estimates.  In addition, future environmental, economic or geologic changes may occur or become known that require reserve revisions either upward or downward from prior reserve estimates. 38FINANCING RISKSOur credit ratings could be lowered below investment grade in the future.  If this were to occur, it could impact our access to capital, cost of capital and other operating costs.Our issuer credit rating is Baa2 (Stable outlook) by Moody’s; BBB+ (Stable outlook) by S&P; and BBB+ (Stable outlook) by Fitch.  Reduction of our credit ratings could impair our ability to refinance or repay our existing debt and to complete new financings on reasonable terms, or at all.  A credit rating downgrade, particularly to a sub-investment grade, could also result in counterparties requiring us to post additional collateral under existing or new contracts or trades.  In addition, a ratings downgrade would increase our interest expense under some of our existing debt obligations, including borrowings under our credit facilities.Derivatives regulations could impede our ability to manage business and financial risks by restricting our use of derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates.Dodd-Frank contains significant derivatives regulations, including a requirement that certain transactions be cleared resulting in a requirement to post cash collateral (commonly referred to as “margin”) for such transactions.  Dodd-Frank provides for a potential exception from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end-users such as utilities and it includes a number of defined terms that will be used in determining how this exception applies to particular derivative transactions and the parties to those transactions.We use natural gas derivative instruments for our hedging activities for our Gas and Electric Utilities’ operations.  We may also use interest rate derivative instruments to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations.  As a result of Dodd-Frank regulations promulgated by the CFTC, we may be required to post collateral for certain swap transactions we enter into.  In addition, our exchange-traded futures contracts are subject to futures margin posting requirements, which could have a significant impact on our business by reducing our ability to execute derivative transactions to reduce commodity price uncertainty and to protect cash flows.  Requirements to post collateral may cause significant liquidity issues by reducing our ability to use cash for investment or other corporate purposes, or may require us to increase our level of debt.  In addition, a requirement for our counterparties to post collateral could result in additional costs being passed on to us, thereby decreasing our profitability.Our hedging activities that are designed to protect against commodity price and financial market risks may cause fluctuations in reported financial results due to accounting requirements associated with such activities.We use various financial contracts and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps to manage commodity price and financial market risks.  The timing of the recognition of gains or losses on these economic hedges in accordance with GAAP does not always match up with the gains or losses on the commodities being hedged.  The difference in accounting may result in volatility in reported results, even though the expected profit margin may be essentially unchanged from the dates the transactions were consummated.Our use of derivative financial instruments could result in material financial losses.From time to time, we have sought to limit a portion of the potential adverse effects resulting from changes in commodity prices and interest rates by using derivative financial instruments and other hedging mechanisms.  To the extent that we hedge our commodity price and interest rate exposures, we forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in our favor.  In addition, even though they are closely monitored by management, our hedging activities can result in losses.  Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the hedge arrangement, the hedge is economically imperfect, commodity prices or interest rates move unfavorably related to our physical or financial positions, or hedging policies and procedures are not followed.Market performance or changes in other assumptions could require us to make significant unplanned contributions to our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans.  Increasing costs associated with our defined benefit retirement plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.As discussed in Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have one defined benefit pension plan (the pension plan is closed to new employees and frozen for certain employees who did not meet age and service based criteria) and several defined post-retirement healthcare plans and non-qualified retirement plans that cover certain eligible employees.  Assumptions related to future costs, return on investments, interest rates and other actuarial  39assumptions have a significant impact on our funding requirements and the expense recognized related to these plans.  These estimates and assumptions may change based on actual return on plan assets, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations.We have a holding company corporate structure with multiple subsidiaries.  Corporate dividends and debt payments are dependent upon cash distributions to the holding company from the subsidiaries.As a holding company, our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets.  Our operating cash flow and ability to service our indebtedness depend on the operating cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends or advances.  Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available for that purpose, whether by dividends or otherwise.  In addition, each subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to us depends on any applicable contractual or regulatory restrictions that may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of cash, working capital, equity or debt service funds.There is no assurance as to the amount, if any, of future dividends because they depend on our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition and are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.  Our operating subsidiaries have certain restrictions on their ability to transfer funds in the form of dividends or loans to us.  See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these restrictions and their impact on our liquidity.We may be unable to obtain financing on reasonable terms needed to refinance debt, fund planned capital expenditures or otherwise execute our operating strategy.Our ability to execute our operating strategy is highly dependent upon our access to capital.  Historically, we have addressed our liquidity needs (including funds required to make scheduled principal and interest payments, refinance debt and fund working capital and planned capital expenditures) with operating cash flow, borrowings under credit facilities, proceeds of debt and equity offerings, and proceeds from asset sales.  Our ability to access the capital markets and the costs and terms of available financing depend on many factors, including changes in our credit ratings, changes in the federal or state regulatory environment affecting energy companies, volatility in commodity or electricity prices, and general economic and market conditions.In addition, because we are a holding company and our utility assets are owned by our subsidiaries, if we are unable to adequately access the credit markets, we could be required to take additional measures designed to ensure that our utility subsidiaries are adequately capitalized to provide safe and reliable service.  Possible additional measures would be evaluated in the context of then-prevailing market conditions, prudent financial management and any applicable regulatory requirements.National and regional economic conditions may cause increased counterparty credit risk, late payments and uncollectible accounts, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.A future recession may lead to an increase in late payments from retail, commercial and industrial utility customers, as well as from our non-utility customers.  If late payments and uncollectible accounts increase, earnings and cash flows from our continuing operations may be reduced.Our ability to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers.  Our insurance coverage may not provide protection against all significant losses.Our ability to obtain insurance, as well as the cost of such insurance, could be impacted by developments affecting insurance businesses, international, national, state or local events, as well as the financial condition of insurers.  Insurance coverage may not continue to be available at all, or at rates or on terms similar to those presently available to us.  A loss for which we are not fully insured could materially and adversely affect our financial results.  Our insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which the Company may be subject, including but not limited to environmental hazards, fire-related liability from natural events or inadequate facility maintenance, distribution property losses, cyber-security risks and dangers that exist in the gathering and transportation of gas in pipelines. 40Increasing costs associated with our healthcare plans and other benefits may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.The costs of providing healthcare benefits to our employees and retirees have increased substantially in recent years.  We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs related to healthcare plans for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise.  Significant regulatory developments have, and likely will continue to, require changes to our current employee benefit plans and in our administrative and accounting processes, as well as changes to the cost of our plans, and the  increasing costs and funding requirements associated with our healthcare plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Our electric and gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding.  Within our utility rates we have generally recovered the cost of providing employee benefits.  As benefit costs continue to rise, there can be no assurance that the state public utility commissions will allow recovery.An effective system of internal control may not be maintained, leading to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management to make an assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal controls.  Our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of these controls.  During their assessment of these controls, management or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify areas of weakness in control design or effectiveness, which may lead to the conclusion that a material weakness in internal control exists.  Any control deficiencies we identify in the future could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis, which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports or have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business or access sources of liquidity.A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met.  If we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, market perception of our business, operating results and stock price could be adversely affected.ENVIRONMENTAL RISKSDevelopments in federal and state laws concerning GHG regulations and air emissions relating to climate may adversely impact operations, financial results and materially increase our generation and production costs, which could render some of our generating units uneconomical to operate and maintain.To the extent climate change occurs, our businesses could be adversely impacted.  We believe it is likely that any such resulting impacts would occur very gradually over a very long period of time and thus would be difficult to quantify.  Warmer temperatures in our natural gas service territories, or cooler temperatures in our electric service territories could adversely affect financial results through lower natural gas volumes delivered, lower MWh sold and associated lower revenues.We own and operate regulated and non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants in South Dakota, Wyoming and Colorado.  Developments under federal and state laws and regulations governing air emissions from fossil-fuel generating plants may result in more stringent emission limitations, which could have a material impact on our costs of operations.  Various pending or final state and EPA regulations that will impact our facilities are also discussed in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the section “Environmental Matters”.Due to uncertainty as to the final outcome of federal climate regulation, legal challenges, state CPP developments or regulatory changes under the Clean Air Act, we cannot definitively estimate the effect of GHG legislation or regulation on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.New or more stringent regulations or other energy efficiency requirements could require us to incur significant additional costs relating to, among other things, the installation of additional emission control equipment, the acceleration of capital expenditures, the purchase of additional emissions allowances or offsets, the acquisition or development of additional energy supply from renewable resources, the closure or reduction of load of coal-fired power generation facilities and potential increased load of our combined cycle natural gas-fired generation units.  To the extent our regulated fossil-fuel generating plants are included in rate base we will attempt to recover costs associated with complying with emission standards or other requirements.  We will also attempt to recover the emission compliance costs of our non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants  41from utility and other purchasers of the power generated by those non-regulated power plants.  Any unrecovered costs could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, future changes in environmental regulations governing air emissions could render some of our power generating units more expensive or uneconomical to operate and maintain.The costs to achieve or maintain compliance with existing or future governmental laws, regulations or requirements, and any failure to do so, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.Our business segments are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous waste.  These laws and regulations may result in increased capital, operating and other costs.  These laws and regulations generally require the business segments to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals.  Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may require significant expenditures, including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising from contaminated properties.  Failure to comply with environmental regulations may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive measures affecting operating assets. The business segments may not be successful in recovering capital and operating costs incurred to comply with new environmental regulations through existing regulatory rate structures and contracts with customers.  More stringent environmental laws or regulations could result in additional costs of operation for existing facilities or impede the development of new facilities.  Although it is not expected that the costs to comply with current environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on the business segments’ financial position, results of operations or cash flows, future environmental compliance costs could have a significant negative impact.The characteristics of coal may make it difficult for coal users to comply with various environmental standards related to coal combustion or utilization and the use of alternative energy sources for power generation as mandated by states could reduce coal consumption.Future regulations may require further reductions in emissions of mercury, hazardous pollutants, SO2, NOx, volatile organic compounds, particulate matter and GHG, which are released into the air when coal is burned.  These requirements could require the installation of costly emission control technology or the implementation of other measures. Coal competes with other energy sources, such as natural gas, wind, solar and hydropower.  The EPA was directed to repeal, revise and replace the CPP rule.  At this time, it is not known what effect this will have on coal as a domestic energy source, and could have a significant impact on our mining operations.Existing or proposed legislation focusing on emissions enacted by the United States or individual states could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative for our customers and could impose a tax or fee on the producer of the coal.  If our customers decrease the volume of coal they purchase from us or switch to alternative fuels as a result of existing or future environmental regulations aimed at reducing emissions, our results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be adversely impacted"
5,BKH,BLACK HILLS CORP,2018-02-26,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSThe nature of our business subjects us to a number of uncertainties and risks.  The following risk factors and other risk factors that we discuss in our periodic reports filed with the SEC should be considered for a better understanding of our Company.  These important factors and other matters discussed herein could cause our future actual results or outcomes to differ materially.OPERATING RISKSOur financial performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities.  If the risks involved in our operations are not appropriately managed or mitigated, our operations may not be successful and this could adversely affect our results of operations.Operating electric generating facilities, the coal mine and electric and natural gas distribution systems involves risks, including:•Disrupted transmission and distribution.  We depend on transmission and distribution facilities, including those operated by unaffiliated parties, to deliver the electricity and gas that we sell to our retail and wholesale customers.  If transmission is interrupted, our ability to sell or deliver product and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered;•Interruptions to supply of fuel and other commodities used in generation and distribution.  Our utilities purchase fuel from a number of suppliers.  Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the delivery of fuel due to various factors, including but not limited to, transportation delays, labor relations, weather and environmental regulations, which could limit our utilities’ ability to operate their facilities;•Electricity is dangerous for employees and the general public should they come in contact with power lines or electrical service facilities and equipment.  Natural conditions and other disasters such as wind, lightning and winter storms can cause wildfires, pole failures and associated property damage and outages;•Operating hazards such as leaks, mechanical problems and accidents, including explosions, affecting our natural gas distribution system which could impact public safety, reliability and customer confidence;•Operational limitations imposed by environmental and other regulatory requirements;•Breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, including those operated by PacifiCorp at the Wyodak Plant;•Labor relations.  Approximately 27% of our employees are represented by a total of eight collective bargaining agreements;•Our ability to transition and replace our retirement-eligible utility employees.  At December 31, 2017, approximately 24% of our Electric Utilities and Gas Utilities employees were eligible for regular or early retirement;•Inability to recruit and retain skilled technical labor; and•Disruption in the functioning of our information technology and network infrastructure which are vulnerable to disability, failures and unauthorized access.  If our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions.Changes in the interpretation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) could adversely affect us.On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law, significantly reforming the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.  The TCJA, among other things, includes a decrease in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures, and modifies or repeals many business deductions and credits.  The new tax law contains several provisions that impacted our 2017 financial results and will impact the Company into the future.  As allowed under SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), the Company has recorded provisional income tax amounts as of December 31, 2017 for changes pursuant to the TCJA related to depreciation, for which the impacts could not be finalized upon issuance of the Company’s financial statements but reasonable estimates could be determined. 32In accordance with ASC 740, the enactment of the law on December 22, 2017 required revaluation of federal deferred tax assets and liabilities using the new lower corporate statutory tax rate of 21%.  As a result of the revaluation, deferred tax assets and liabilities were reduced by approximately $309 million.  Of the $309 million, approximately $301 million is related to our regulated utilities and is reclassified to a regulatory liability. This regulatory liability will generally be amortized over the remaining life of the related assets using the normalization principles as specifically prescribed in the TCJA.  On a consolidated financial statement basis, the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to the 21% federal corporate tax rate that are not subject to the regulatory construct resulted in a one-time, non-cash, income tax benefit of approximately $8 million in 2017.The TCJA includes provisions limiting interest deductibility in certain circumstances.  While we expect to maintain deductibility of interest expense, the lower tax rate reduces the tax benefits associated with interest deductibility on holding company debt that is not recovered in the regulatory construct.We are working with utility regulators in each of the states we serve to provide benefits of tax reform to our customers.  We expect an increase in working capital requirements as a result of complying with the TCJA and the impact of providing TCJA benefits to customers.  The lower tax rate effective January 1, 2018, will negatively impact the Company’s cash flows by approximately $35 million to $45 million annually for the next several years.  If we are unable to obtain reasonable outcomes with our utility regulators in passing benefits of the TCJA back to customers, or if our interpretations on the provisions of depreciation or interest deductibility in the TCJA change, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially impacted. Construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve significant risks which could reduce profitability.The construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve many risks, including:•The inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals along with the cost of complying with or satisfying conditions imposed upon such approvals;•Contractual restrictions upon the timing of scheduled outages;•The cost of supplying or securing replacement power during scheduled and unscheduled outages;•The unavailability or increased cost of equipment;•The cost of recruiting and retaining or the unavailability of skilled labor;•Supply interruptions, work stoppages and labor disputes;•Increased capital and operating costs to comply with increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations;•Opposition by members of public or special-interest groups;•Weather interferences;•Availability and cost of fuel supplies;•Unexpected engineering, environmental and geological problems; and•Unanticipated cost overruns.The ongoing operation of our facilities involves many of the risks described above, in addition to risks relating to the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency.  New plants may employ recently developed and technologically complex equipment, including newer environmental emission control technology.  Any of these risks could cause us to operate below expected capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues, increase expenses or cause us to incur higher operating and maintenance costs and penalties.  While we maintain insurance, obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance and  33our rights under warranties or performance guarantees may not be timely or adequate to cover lost revenues, increased expenses, liability or liquidated damage payments.Operating results can be adversely affected by variations from normal weather conditions.Our utility businesses are seasonal businesses and weather patterns can have a material impact on our operating performance.  Demand for electricity is typically greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating.  Demand for natural gas depends heavily upon winter-weather patterns throughout our service territory and a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating season.  Accordingly, our utility operations have historically generated lower revenues and income when weather conditions are cooler than normal in the summer and warmer than normal in the winter. Demand for natural gas is also impacted by summer weather patterns that are cooler than normal and provide higher than normal precipitation; both of which can reduce natural gas demand for irrigation.  Unusually mild summers and winters therefore could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Our businesses are located in areas that could be subject to seasonal natural disasters such as severe snow and ice storms, flooding and wildfires.  These events could result in interruption of our business, damage to our property such as power lines and substations, and repair and clean-up costs.  We may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring transmission and distribution property following these natural disasters through a change in our regulated rates thereby resulting in a negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Our Mining operations are subject to operating risks that are beyond our control which could affect our profitability and production levels.  Our surface mining operations could be disrupted or materially affected due to adverse weather or natural disasters such as heavy snow, strong winds, rain or flooding.Prices for some of our products and services as well as a portion of our operating costs are volatile and may cause our revenues and expenses to fluctuate significantly.A portion of our net income is attributable to sales of contract and off-system wholesale electricity and natural gas.  Energy prices are influenced by many factors outside our control, including, among other things, fuel prices, transmission constraints, supply and demand, weather, general economic conditions, and the rules, regulations and actions of system operators in those markets.  Moreover, unlike most other commodities, electricity cannot be stored and therefore must be produced concurrently with its use.  As a result, wholesale power markets may be subject to significant, unpredictable price fluctuations over relatively short periods of time.Our Mining operations require reliable supplies of replacement parts, explosives, fuel, tires and steel-related products.  If the cost of these increase significantly, or if sources of supplies and mining equipment become unavailable to meet our replacement demands, our productivity and profitability could be lower than our current expectations.Our revenues, results of operations and financial condition are impacted by customer growth and usage in our service territories and may fluctuate with current economic conditions, emerging technologies or responses to price increases.Our revenues, results of operations and financial condition are impacted by demand in our service territories.  Customer growth and usage may be impacted by a number of factors, including the voluntary reduction of consumption of electricity and natural gas by our customers in response to increases in prices and demand-side management programs, economic conditions impacting decreases in customers’ disposable income and the use of distributed generation resources or other emerging technologies.  Continued technological improvements may make customer and third-party distributed generation and energy storage systems, including fuel cells, micro-turbines, wind turbines, solar cells and batteries, more cost effective and feasible for our customers.  If more customers utilize their own generation, demand for energy from us would decline.  Such developments could affect the price of energy and delivery of energy, require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands and could make portions of our electric system power supply and transmission and/or distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives.  Each of these factors could materially affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Our operations rely on storage and transportation assets owned by third parties to satisfy our obligations.Our Electric Utilities, Gas Utilities and Power Generation segments rely on pipeline companies and other owners of gas storage facilities to deliver natural gas to customers, to supply our natural gas-fired power plants and to hedge commodity costs.  If storage capacity is inadequate or transportation is disrupted, our ability to satisfy our obligations may be hindered.  As a result,  34we may be responsible for damages incurred by our counterparties, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at then-current market rates, or for penalties imposed by state regulatory authorities.Our utilities are subject to pipeline safety and system integrity laws and regulations that may require significant capital expenditures or significant increases in operating costs.Compliance with pipeline safety and system integrity laws and regulations, or future changes in these laws and regulations, may result in increased capital, operating and other costs which may not be recoverable in a timely manner from customers in rates.  Failure to comply may result in fines, penalties, or injunctive measures that would not be recoverable from customers in rates and could result in a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Our energy production, transmission and distribution activities, and our storage facilities for our natural gas involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other catastrophic events that could give rise to additional costs and cause a substantial loss to us.Inherent in our natural gas and electricity transmission and distribution activities, as well as in our transportation and storage of natural gas and our Mining operations, are a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, blowouts, fires, releases of hazardous materials, explosions and operational problems.  These events could impact the safety of employees or others and result in injury or loss of human life, and cause significant damage to property or natural resources (including public lands), environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial financial losses to us.  Particularly for our transmission and distribution lines located near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering areas, the damages resulting from any such events could be substantial.  While we maintain liability and property insurance coverage, such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles.  The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Threats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt our businesses, or the businesses of third parties, may impact our operations in unpredictable ways.Terrorist acts or other similar events could harm our businesses by limiting their ability to generate, purchase or transmit power and by delaying their development and construction of new generating facilities and capital improvements to existing facilities.  These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair and insure our assets and could adversely affect our operations by contributing to disruption of supplies and markets for natural gas, oil and other fuels.  They could also impair our ability to raise capital by contributing to financial instability and lower economic activity.The implementation of security guidelines and measures and maintenance of insurance, to the extent available, addressing such activities could increase costs.  These types of events could materially adversely affect our financial results.  In addition, these types of events could require significant management attention and resources and could adversely affect our reputation among customers and the public.A cyber attack may disrupt our operations, or lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information and create a potential liability.We use and operate sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure.  In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we collect and retain sensitive information including personal information about our customers and employees.  Cyber attacks targeting our electronic control systems used at our generating facilities and for electric and gas distribution systems, could result in a full or partial disruption of our electric and/or gas operations.  Cyber attacks targeting other key information technology systems could further add to a full or partial disruption of our operations.  Any disruption of these operations could result in a loss of service to customers and a significant decrease in revenues, as well as significant expense to repair system damage and remedy security breaches.  Any theft, loss and/or fraudulent use of customer, shareowner, employee or proprietary data as a result of a cyber attack could subject us to significant litigation, liability and costs, as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators, among others.We have instituted security measures and safeguards to protect our operational systems and information technology assets, including certain safeguards required by FERC.  The security measures and safeguards we have implemented may not always be effective due to the evolving nature and sophistication of cyber attacks.  Despite our implementation of security measures and safeguards, all of our information technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access, including cyber attacks.  If our information technology systems were to fail or be breached by a cyber attack or a computer  35virus and be unable to recover in a timely way, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions and sensitive confidential and other data could be compromised which could have a material adverse effect not only on our financial results, but on our public reputation as well.Increased risks of regulatory penalties could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.Business activities in the energy sector are heavily regulated, primarily by agencies of the federal government.  Agencies that historically sought voluntary compliance, or issued non-monetary sanctions, now employ mandatory civil penalty structures for regulatory violations.  The FERC, NERC, CFTC, EPA, OSHA, SEC and MSHA may impose significant civil and criminal penalties to enforce compliance requirements relative to our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and/or our financial results.Certain Federal laws, including the Migratory Bird Act and the Endangered Species Act, provide special protection to certain designated species.  These laws and any state equivalents provide for significant civil and criminal penalties for non-permitted activities that result in harm to or harassment of certain protected animals, including damage to their habitats.  If such species are located in an area in which we conduct operations, or if additional species in those areas become subject to protection, our operations and development projects, particularly transmission, generation, wind and pipeline projects, could be restricted or delayed, or we could be required to implement expensive mitigation measures.Our current or future development and expansion activities may not be successful, which could impair our ability to execute our growth strategy.Execution of our growth plan is dependent on successful ongoing and future development and expansion activities.  We can provide no assurance that we will be able to complete development projects or expansion activities we undertake or continue to develop attractive opportunities for growth.  Factors that could cause our development and expansion activities to be unsuccessful include:•Our inability to obtain required governmental permits;•Our inability to secure adequate utility rates through regulatory proceedings;•Our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all;•The possibility that one or more credit rating agencies would downgrade our issuer credit rating to below investment grade, thus increasing our cost of doing business;•Our inability to attract and retain management or other key personnel;•Our inability to negotiate acceptable construction, fuel supply, power sales or other material agreements;•Reduced growth in the demand for utility services in the markets we serve;•Changes in federal, state, local or tribal laws and regulations, particularly those which would make it more difficult or costly to fully develop our coal reserves or our power generation capacity;•Fuel prices or fuel supply constraints;•Pipeline capacity and transmission constraints;•Competition within our industry and with producers of competing energy sources; and•Changes in tax rates and policies. 36UtilitiesRegulatory commissions may refuse to approve some or all of the utility rate increases we have requested or may request in the future, or may determine that amounts passed through to customers were not prudently incurred and therefore are not recoverable.Our regulated Electric Utilities and Gas Utilities are subject to cost-of-service regulation and earnings oversight from federal and state utility commissions.  This regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of desired earnings levels.  Our retail electric and gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding.  The rates that we are allowed to charge may or may not match our related costs and allowed return on invested capital at any given time.  While rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that the state public utility commissions will judge all of our costs, including our direct and allocated borrowing and debt service costs, to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that produce a full recovery of our costs and the return on invested capital allowed by the applicable state public utility commission.To some degree, each of our Electric and Gas Utilities are permitted to recover certain costs (such as increased fuel and purchased power costs) without having to file a rate case.  To the extent we are able to pass through such costs to our customers and a state public utility commission subsequently determines that such costs should not have been paid by the customers; we may be required to refund such costs.  Any such costs not recovered through rates, or any such refund, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.If market or other conditions adversely affect operations or require us to make changes to our business strategy in any of our utility businesses, we may be forced to record a non-cash goodwill impairment charge.  Any significant impairment of our goodwill related to these utilities would cause a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net income and shareholders’ equity.We had approximately $1.3 billion of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017.  A substantial portion of the goodwill is related to the SourceGas Acquisition and the Aquila Transaction.  If we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect operations in any of our businesses, we may be forced to record a non-cash impairment charge, which would reduce our reported assets, net income and shareholders’ equity.  Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.  If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill in the period the determination is made.  The testing of goodwill for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions.  These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including:  future business operating performance, changes in economic conditions and interest rates, regulatory, industry or market conditions, changes in business operations, changes in competition or changes in technologies.  Any changes in key assumptions, or actual performance compared with key assumptions, about our business and its future prospects could affect the fair value of one or more business segments, which may result in an impairment charge.Municipal governments may seek to limit or deny franchise privileges which could inhibit our ability to secure adequate recovery of our investment in assets subject to condemnation.Municipal governments within our utility service territories possess the power of condemnation and could establish a municipal utility within a portion of our current service territories by limiting or denying franchise privileges for our operations and exercising powers of condemnation over all or part of our utility assets within municipal boundaries.  Although condemnation is a process that is subject to constitutional protections requiring just and fair compensation, as with any judicial procedure, the outcome is uncertain.  If a municipality sought to pursue this course of action, we cannot assure that we would secure adequate recovery of our investment in assets subject to condemnation. 37MiningIf the assumptions underlying our reclamation and mine closure obligations are materially inaccurate, our costs could be significantly greater than anticipated or be incurred sooner than anticipated.We conduct surface mining operations that are subject to operations, reclamation and closure standards.  We estimate our total reclamation liabilities based on permit requirements, engineering studies and our engineering expertise related to these requirements.  The estimate of ultimate reclamation liability is reviewed periodically by our management and engineers and by government regulators.  The estimated liability can change significantly if actual costs vary from our original assumptions or if government regulations change significantly.  GAAP requires that asset retirement obligations be recorded as a liability based on fair value, which reflects the present value of the estimated future cash flows.  In estimating future cash flows, we consider the estimated current cost of reclamation and apply inflation rates.  The resulting estimated reclamation obligations could change significantly if actual amounts or the timing of these expenses change significantly from our assumptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.Estimates of the quality and quantity of our coal reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in three-dimensional structural modeling, and any inaccuracies in interpretation or modeling could materially affect the estimated quantity and quality of our reserves.The process of estimating coal reserves is uncertain and requires interpretations and modeling.  Significant inaccuracies in interpretation or modeling could materially affect the quantity and quality of our reserve estimates.  The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of engineering and geological interpretation, conditions encountered during actual reserve recovery and undetected deposit anomalies.  Variance from the assumptions used and drill hole modeling density could result in additions or deletions from our volume estimates.  In addition, future environmental, economic or geologic changes may occur or become known that require reserve revisions either upward or downward from prior reserve estimates.FINANCING RISKSOur credit ratings could be lowered below investment grade in the future.  If this were to occur, it could impact our access to capital, cost of capital and other operating costs.Our issuer credit rating is Baa2 (Stable outlook) by Moody’s; BBB (Stable outlook) by S&P; and BBB+ (Stable outlook) by Fitch.  Reduction of our credit ratings could impair our ability to refinance or repay our existing debt and to complete new financings on reasonable terms, or at all.  A credit rating downgrade, particularly to a sub-investment grade, could also result in counterparties requiring us to post additional collateral under existing or new contracts or trades.  In addition, a ratings downgrade would increase our interest expense under some of our existing debt obligations, including borrowings under our credit facilities.Derivatives regulations could impede our ability to manage business and financial risks by restricting our use of derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates.Dodd-Frank contains significant derivatives regulations, including a requirement that certain transactions be cleared resulting in a requirement to post cash collateral (commonly referred to as “margin”) for such transactions.  Dodd-Frank provides for a potential exception from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end-users such as utilities and it includes a number of defined terms that will be used in determining how this exception applies to particular derivative transactions and the parties to those transactions.We use natural gas derivative instruments for our hedging activities for our Gas and Electric Utilities’ operations.  We may also use interest rate derivative instruments to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations.  As a result of Dodd-Frank regulations promulgated by the CFTC, we may be required to post collateral to clearing entities for certain swap transactions we enter into.  In addition our exchange-traded futures contracts are subject to futures margin posting requirements, which could have a significant impact on our business by reducing our ability to execute derivative transactions to reduce commodity price and interest rate uncertainty and to protect cash flows.  Requirements to post collateral may cause significant liquidity issues by reducing our ability to use cash for investment or other corporate purposes, or may require us to increase our level of debt.  In addition, a requirement for our counterparties to post collateral could result in additional costs being passed on to us, thereby decreasing our profitability. 38Our hedging activities that are designed to protect against commodity price and financial market risks may cause fluctuations in reported financial results due to accounting requirements associated with such activities.We use various financial contracts and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps to manage commodity price and financial market risks.  The timing of the recognition of gains or losses on these economic hedges in accordance with GAAP does not always match up with the gains or losses on the commodities or assets being hedged.  The difference in accounting can result in volatility in reported results, even though the expected profit margin may be essentially unchanged from the dates the transactions were consummated.Our use of derivative financial instruments could result in material financial losses.From time to time, we have sought to limit a portion of the potential adverse effects resulting from changes in commodity prices and interest rates by using derivative financial instruments and other hedging mechanisms.  To the extent that we hedge our commodity price and interest rate exposures, we forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in our favor.  In addition, even though they are closely monitored by management, our hedging activities can result in losses.  Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the hedge arrangement, the hedge is economically imperfect, commodity prices or interest rates move unfavorably related to our physical or financial positions, or hedging policies and procedures are not followed.Market performance or changes in other assumptions could require us to make significant unplanned contributions to our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans.  Increasing costs associated with our defined benefit retirement plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.As discussed in Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have one defined benefit pension plan (the pension plan is closed to new employees and frozen for certain employees who did not meet age and service based criteria) and several defined post-retirement healthcare plans and non-qualified retirement plans that cover certain eligible employees.  Assumptions related to future costs, return on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on our funding requirements and the expense recognized related to these plans.  These estimates and assumptions may change based on actual return on plan assets, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations.We have a holding company corporate structure with multiple subsidiaries.  Corporate dividends and debt payments are dependent upon cash distributions to the holding company from the subsidiaries.As a holding company, our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets.  Our operating cash flow and ability to service our indebtedness depend on the operating cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends or advances.  Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available for that purpose, whether by dividends or otherwise.  In addition, each subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to us depends on any applicable contractual or regulatory restrictions that may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of cash, working capital, equity or debt service funds.There is no assurance as to the amount, if any, of future dividends because they depend on our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition and are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.  Our operating subsidiaries have certain restrictions on their ability to transfer funds in the form of dividends or loans to us.  See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these restrictions and their impact on our liquidity.We may be unable to obtain financing on reasonable terms needed to refinance debt, fund planned capital expenditures or otherwise execute our operating strategy.Our ability to execute our operating strategy is highly dependent upon our access to capital.  Historically, we have addressed our liquidity needs (including funds required to make scheduled principal and interest payments, refinance debt and fund working capital and planned capital expenditures) with operating cash flow, borrowings under credit facilities, proceeds of debt and equity offerings, and proceeds from asset sales.  Our ability to access the capital markets and the costs and terms of available financing depend on many factors, including changes in our credit ratings, changes in the federal or state regulatory environment affecting energy companies, volatility in commodity or electricity prices, and general economic and market conditions. 39In addition, because we are a holding company and our utility assets are owned by our subsidiaries, if we are unable to adequately access the credit markets, we could be required to take additional measures designed to ensure that our utility subsidiaries are adequately capitalized to provide safe and reliable service.  Possible additional measures would be evaluated in the context of then-prevailing market conditions, prudent financial management and any applicable regulatory requirements.National and regional economic conditions may cause increased counterparty credit risk, late payments and uncollectible accounts, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.A future recession may lead to an increase in late payments from retail, commercial and industrial utility customers, as well as from our non-utility customers.  If late payments and uncollectible accounts increase, earnings and cash flows from our continuing operations may be reduced.Our ability to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers.  Our insurance coverage may not provide protection against all significant losses.Our ability to obtain insurance, as well as the cost of such insurance, could be impacted by developments affecting insurance businesses, international, national, state or local events, as well as the financial condition of insurers.  Insurance coverage may not continue to be available at all, or at rates or on terms similar to those presently available to us.  A loss for which we are not fully insured could materially and adversely affect our financial results.  Our insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which the Company may be subject, including but not limited to environmental hazards, fire-related liability from natural events or inadequate facility maintenance, distribution property losses, cyber-security risks and dangers that exist in the gathering and transportation of gas in pipelines.Increasing costs associated with our health care plans and other benefits may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.The costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees have increased substantially in recent years.  We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs related to health care plans for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise.  Significant regulatory developments have, and likely will continue to, require changes to our current employee benefit plans and in our administrative and accounting processes, as well as changes to the cost of our plans, and the  increasing costs and funding requirements associated with our health care plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.Our electric and gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding.  Within our utility rates we have generally recovered the cost of providing employee benefits.  As benefit costs continue to rise, there can be no assurance that the state public utility commissions will allow recovery.An effective system of internal control may not be maintained, leading to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management to make an assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal controls.  Our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of these controls.  During their assessment of these controls, management or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify areas of weakness in control design or effectiveness, which may lead to the conclusion that a material weakness in internal control exists.  Any control deficiencies we identify in the future could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis, which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports or have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business or access sources of liquidity.A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. If we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, market perception of our business, operating results and stock price could be adversely affected. 40ENVIRONMENTAL RISKSFederal and state laws concerning GHG regulations and air emissions may materially increase our generation and production costs and could render some of our generating units uneconomical to operate and maintain.We own and operate regulated and non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants in South Dakota, Wyoming and Colorado.  Developments under federal and state laws and regulations governing air emissions from fossil-fuel generating plants may result in more stringent emission limitations, which could have a material impact on our costs of operations.  Various pending or final state and EPA regulations that will impact our facilities are also discussed in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the section “Environmental Matters.”Due to uncertainty as to the final outcome of federal climate change legislation, legal challenges, state clean power plan developments or regulatory changes under the Clean Air Act, we cannot definitively estimate the effect of GHG legislation or regulation on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.New or more stringent regulations or other energy efficiency requirements could require us to incur significant additional costs relating to, among other things, the installation of additional emission control equipment, the acceleration of capital expenditures, the purchase of additional emissions allowances or offsets, the acquisition or development of additional energy supply from renewable resources, the closure or reduction of load of coal-fired power generation facilities and potential increased load of our combined cycle natural gas-fired generation units.  To the extent our regulated fossil-fuel generating plants are included in rate base we will attempt to recover costs associated with complying with emission standards or other requirements.  We will also attempt to recover the emission compliance costs of our non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants from utility and other purchasers of the power generated by those non-regulated power plants.  Any unrecovered costs could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, future changes in environmental regulations governing air emissions could render some of our power generating units more expensive or uneconomical to operate and maintain.The costs to achieve or maintain compliance with existing or future governmental laws, regulations or requirements, and any failure to do so, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.Our business segments are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous waste.  These laws and regulations may result in increased capital, operating and other costs.  These laws and regulations generally require the business segments to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals.  Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may require significant expenditures, including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising from contaminated properties.  Failure to comply with environmental regulations may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive measures affecting operating assets. The business segments may not be successful in recovering capital and operating costs incurred to comply with new environmental regulations through existing regulatory rate structures and contracts with customers.  More stringent environmental laws or regulations could result in additional costs of operation for existing facilities or impede the development of new facilities.  Although it is not expected that the costs to comply with current environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on the business segments’ financial position, results of operations or cash flows, future environmental compliance costs could have a significant negative impact..The characteristics of coal may make it difficult for coal users to comply with various environmental standards related to coal combustion or utilization and the use of alternative energy sources for power generation as mandated by states could reduce coal consumption.Future regulations may require further reductions in emissions of mercury, hazardous pollutants, SO2, NOx, volatile organic compounds, particulate matter and GHG, which are released into the air when coal is burned.  These requirements could require the installation of costly emission control technology or the implementation of other measures.  Reductions in mercury emissions required by EPA’s MATS rule, will likely require some power plants to install new equipment, at substantial cost, or discourage the use of certain coals containing higher levels of mercury. Coal competes with other energy sources, such as natural gas, wind, solar and hydropower.  The EPA was directed to repeal, revise and replace the CPP rule.  At this time, it is not known what effect this will have on coal as a domestic energy source, and could have a significant impact on our mining operations. 41Existing or proposed legislation focusing on emissions enacted by the United States or individual states could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative for our customers and could impose a tax or fee on the producer of the coal.  If our customers decrease the volume of coal they purchase from us or switch to alternative fuels as a result of existing or future environmental regulations aimed at reducing emissions, our operations and financial results could be adversely impacted.Oil and Gas (Discontinued Operations)If the risks involved in our Oil and Gas operations are not appropriately managed or mitigated through final sale dates, or if the divestiture of this business segment does not occur as currently anticipated, we could incur costs and/or additional write-downs of the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties.As of February 23, 2018, we have either closed transactions or signed contracts to sell more than 90 percent of our oil and gas properties.  We expect to conclude the sale of all of our remaining oil and gas assets by mid-year 2018.  Until the sale transactions are final, we continue to own and operate these assets and are exposed to the risks associated with those operations.  In addition, while we have signed agreements for the significant majority of the properties, until the sales are closed, there is a risk that the transactions do not occur as planned.  Additional operating costs, additional write-down of carrying value or the non-closure of sale agreements as currently signed could result in an adverse impact to our financial results"
6,BKH,BLACK HILLS CORP,2017-02-27,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSThe nature of our business subjects us to a number of uncertainties and risks.  The following risk factors and other risk factors that we discuss in our periodic reports filed with the SEC should be considered for a better understanding of our Company.  These important factors and other matters discussed herein could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ materially.OPERATING RISKSOur current or future development, expansion and acquisition activities may not be successful, which could impair our ability to execute our growth strategy.Execution of our future growth plan is dependent on successful ongoing and future development, expansion and acquisition activities.  We can provide no assurance that we will be able to complete development projects or acquisitions we undertake or continue to develop attractive opportunities for growth.  Factors that could cause our development, expansion and acquisition activities to be unsuccessful include:•Our inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals or the imposition of adverse conditions upon the approval of any acquisition;•Our inability to secure adequate utility rates through regulatory proceedings;•Our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all;•The possibility that one or more credit rating agencies would downgrade our issuer credit rating to below investment grade, thus increasing our cost of doing business;•Our inability to successfully integrate any businesses we acquire;•Our inability to attract and retain management or other key personnel;•Our inability to negotiate acceptable acquisition, construction, fuel supply, power sales or other material agreements;•Reduced growth in the demand for utility services in the markets we serve;•Changes in federal, state, local or tribal laws and regulations, particularly those which would make it more difficult or costly to fully develop our coal reserves, our oil and gas reserves or our power generation capacity;•Fuel prices or fuel supply constraints;•Pipeline capacity and transmission constraints;•Competition within our industry and with producers of competing energy sources; and•Changes in tax rates and policies.The SourceGas Transaction may not achieve its intended results, including anticipated operating efficiencies and cost savings, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.While management expects that the SourceGas Transaction will result in various benefits, including a significant amount of operating efficiencies and other financial and operational benefits, there can be no assurance regarding when or the extent to which we will be able to realize these operating efficiencies or other benefits.  Events outside of our control, including but not limited to regulatory changes or developments, could also adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the transaction. 57Our financial performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities.  If the risks involved in our operations are not appropriately managed or mitigated, our operations may not be successful and this could adversely affect our results of operations.Operating electric generating facilities, oil and gas properties, the coal mine and electric and natural gas distribution systems involves risks, including:•Operational limitations imposed by environmental and other regulatory requirements;•Interruptions to supply of fuel and other commodities used in generation and distribution.  Our utilities purchase fuel from a number of suppliers.  Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the delivery of fuel due to various factors, including but not limited to, transportation delays, labor relations, weather and environmental regulations, which could limit our utilities’ ability to operate their facilities;•Breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, including those operated by PacifiCorp at the Wyodak plant;•Our ability to transition and replace our retirement-eligible utility employees.  At December 31, 2016, approximately 27% of our Electric Utilities and Gas Utilities employees were eligible for regular or early retirement;•Inability to recruit and retain skilled technical labor;•Disrupted transmission and distribution.  We depend on transmission and distribution facilities, including those operated by unaffiliated parties, to deliver the electricity and gas that we sell to our retail and wholesale customers.  If transmission is interrupted, our ability to sell or deliver product and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered;•Operating hazards such as leaks, mechanical problems and accidents, including explosions, affecting our natural gas distribution system which could impact public safety, reliability and customer confidence;•Electricity is dangerous for employees and the general public should they come in contact with power lines or electrical service facilities and equipment.  Natural conditions and other disasters such as wind, lightning and winter storms can cause wildfires, pole failures and associated property damage and outages;•Disruption in the functioning of our information technology and network infrastructure which are vulnerable to disability, failures and unauthorized access.  If our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions; and•Labor relations.  Approximately 27% of our employees are represented by a total of seven collective bargaining agreements.Construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve significant risks which could reduce profitability.The construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve many risks, including:•The inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals along with the cost of complying with or satisfying conditions imposed upon such approvals;•Contractual restrictions upon the timing of scheduled outages;•The cost of supplying or securing replacement power during scheduled and unscheduled outages;•The unavailability or increased cost of equipment;•The cost of recruiting and retaining or the unavailability of skilled labor;•Supply interruptions, work stoppages and labor disputes; 58•Increased capital and operating costs to comply with increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations;•Opposition by members of public or special-interest groups;•Weather interferences;•Availability and cost of fuel supplies;•Unexpected engineering, environmental and geological problems; and•Unanticipated cost overruns.The ongoing operation of our facilities involves many of the risks described above, in addition to risks relating to the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency.  New plants may employ recently developed and technologically complex equipment, including newer environmental emission control technology.  Any of these risks could cause us to operate below expected capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues, increase expenses or cause us to incur higher operating and maintenance costs and penalties.  While we maintain insurance, obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance and our rights under warranties or performance guarantees may not be timely or adequate to cover lost revenues, increased expenses, liability or liquidated damage payments.Operating results can be adversely affected by variations from normal weather conditions.Our utility businesses are seasonal businesses and weather patterns can have a material impact on our operating performance.  Demand for electricity is typically greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating.  Demand for natural gas depends heavily upon winter-weather patterns throughout our service territory and a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating seasons.  Accordingly, our utility operations have historically generated lower revenues and income when weather conditions are cooler than normal in the summer and warmer than normal in the winter.  Unusually mild summers and winters therefore could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our businesses are located in areas that could be subject to seasonal natural disasters such as severe snow and ice storms, flooding and wildfires.  These factors could result in interruption of our business, damage to our property such as power lines and substations, and repair and clean-up costs associated with these storms.  We may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring transmission and distribution property following these natural disasters through a change in our regulated rates thereby resulting in a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our Mining operations are subject to operating risks that are beyond our control which could affect our profitability and production levels.  Our surface mining operations could be disrupted or materially affected due to adverse weather or natural disasters such as heavy snow, strong winds, rain or flooding.While our planned activity related to our Oil and Gas segment is limited, weather conditions can also limit or temporarily halt our drilling, completion and producing activities at our crude oil and natural gas operations.  Primarily in the winter and spring, our operations can be curtailed because of cold, snow and wet conditions, and severe weather could exacerbate these operational issues.  In addition, weather conditions and other events could temporarily impair our ability to transport our crude oil and natural gas production. 59Prices for some of our products and services as well as a portion of our operating costs are volatile and may cause our revenues and expenses to fluctuate significantly.A portion of our net income is attributable to sales of contract and off-system wholesale electricity and natural gas.  Energy prices are influenced by many factors outside our control, including, among other things, fuel prices, transmission constraints, supply and demand, weather, general economic conditions, and the rules, regulations and actions of system operators in those markets.  Moreover, unlike most other commodities, electricity cannot be stored and therefore must be produced concurrently with its use.  As a result, wholesale power markets may be subject to significant, unpredictable price fluctuations over relatively short periods of time.The success of our crude oil and natural gas operations is affected by the prevailing market prices of crude oil and natural gas.  Crude oil and natural gas prices and markets historically have been, and are likely to continue to be, unpredictable.  A decrease in crude oil or natural gas prices not only reduces revenues and profits, but also reduces the quantity and value of reserves that are commercially recoverable and may result in charges to earnings for impairment of the net capitalized cost of these assets.  Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for crude oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control.The proliferation of domestic crude oil and natural gas shale plays in recent years has provided the market with an abundant new supply of crude oil and natural gas, which has driven prices down in recent years.  There is also risk that increased domestic resources could drive both crude oil and natural gas prices lower.Our mining operation requires reliable supplies of replacement parts, explosives, fuel, tires and steel-related products.  If the cost of these increase significantly, or if sources of supplies and mining equipment become unavailable to meet our replacement demands, our productivity and profitability could be lower than our current expectations.Our revenues, results of operations and financial condition are impacted by customer growth and usage in our service territories and may fluctuate with current economic conditions, emerging technologies or responses to price increases.Our revenues, results of operations and financial condition are impacted by demand in our service territories.  Customer growth and usage may be impacted by a number of factors, including: the voluntary reduction of consumption of electricity and natural gas by our customers in response to increases in prices and demand-side management programs, economic conditions impacting decreases in customers’ disposable income and the use of distributed generation resources or other emerging technologies.  Continued technological improvements may make customer and third-party distributed generation and energy storage systems, including fuel cells, micro-turbines, wind turbines, solar cells and batteries, more cost effective and feasible for our customers.  If more customers utilize their own generation, demand for energy from us would decline.  Such developments could affect the price of energy and delivery of energy, require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands and could make portions of our electric system power supply and transmission and/or distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives.  Each of these factors could materially affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Our operations rely on storage and transportation assets owned by third parties to satisfy our obligations.Our Electric Utilities, Gas Utilities and Power Generation segment rely on pipeline companies and other owners of gas storage facilities to deliver natural gas to ratepayers, to supply our natural gas-fired power plants and to hedge commodity costs.  If storage capacity is inadequate or transportation is disrupted, our ability to satisfy our obligations may be hindered.  As a result, we may be responsible for damages incurred by our counterparties, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at then-current market rates, or for penalties imposed by state regulatory authorities.Our utilities are subject to pipeline safety and system integrity laws and regulations that may require significant capital expenditures or significant increases in operating costs.Compliance with pipeline safety and system integrity laws and regulations, or future changes in these laws and regulations, may result in increased capital, operating and other costs which may not be recoverable in a timely manner from customers in rates.  Failure to comply may result in fines, penalties, or injunctive measures that would not be recoverable from customers in rates and could result in a material impact on our financial results. 60Our energy production, transmission and distribution activities, and our storage facilities for our natural gas involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other catastrophic events that could give rise to additional costs and cause a substantial loss to us.Inherent in our natural gas and electricity transmission and distribution activities, as well as in our production, transportation and storage of crude oil and natural gas and our Mining operations, are a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, blowouts, fires, releases of hazardous materials, explosions and operational problems.  These events could impact the safety of employees or others and result in injury or loss of human life, and cause significant damage to property or natural resources (including public lands), environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial financial losses to us.  Particularly for our transmission and distribution lines located near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering areas, the damages resulting from any such events could be substantial.  While we maintain liability and property insurance coverage, such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles.  The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Threats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt our businesses, or the businesses of third parties, may impact our operations in unpredictable ways.Terrorist acts or other similar events could harm our businesses by limiting their ability to generate, purchase or transmit power and by delaying their development and construction of new generating facilities and capital improvements to existing facilities.  These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair and insure our assets and could adversely affect our operations by contributing to disruption of supplies and markets for natural gas, oil and other fuels.  They could also impair our ability to raise capital by contributing to financial instability and lower economic activity.The implementation of security guidelines and measures and maintenance of insurance, to the extent available, addressing such activities could increase costs.  These types of events could materially adversely affect our financial results.  In addition, these types of events could require significant management attention and resources and could adversely affect our reputation among customers and the public.A cyber attack may disrupt our operations, or lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information and create a potential liability.We use and operate sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure.  In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we collect and retain sensitive information including personal information about our customers and employees.  Cyber attacks targeting our electronic control systems used at our generating facilities and for electric and gas distribution systems, could result in a full or partial disruption of our electric and/or gas operations.  Cyber attacks targeting other key information technology systems could further add to a full or partial disruption to our operations.  Any disruption of these operations could result in a loss of service to customers and a significant decrease in revenues, as well as significant expense to repair system damage and remedy security breaches.  Any theft, loss and/or fraudulent use of customer, shareowner, employee or proprietary data as a result of a cyber attack could subject us to significant litigation, liability and costs, as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators, among others.We have instituted security measures and safeguards to protect our operational systems and information technology assets, including certain safeguards required by FERC.  The security measures and safeguards we have implemented may not always be effective due to the evolving nature and sophistication of cyber attacks.  Despite our implementation of security measures and safeguards, all of our information technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access, including cyber attacks.  If our information technology systems were to fail or be breached by a cyber attack or a computer virus and be unable to recover in a timely way, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions and sensitive confidential and other data could be compromised which could have a material adverse effect not only on our financial results, but on our public reputation as well. 61Increased risks of regulatory penalties could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.Business activities in the energy sector are heavily regulated, primarily by agencies of the federal government.  Agencies that historically sought voluntary compliance, or issued non-monetary sanctions, now employ mandatory civil penalty structures for regulatory violations.  The FERC, NERC, CFTC, EPA, OSHA, SEC and MSHA may impose significant civil and criminal penalties to enforce compliance requirements relative to our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and/or our financial results.Certain Federal laws, including the Migratory Bird Act and the Endangered Species Act, provide special protection to certain designated species.  These laws and any state equivalents provide for significant civil and criminal penalties for non-permitted activities that result in harm to or harassment of certain protected animals, including damage to their habitats.  If such species are located in an area in which we conduct operations, or if additional species in those areas become subject to protection, our operations and development projects, particularly transmission, generation, wind, pipeline or drilling projects, could be restricted or delayed, or we could be required to implement expensive mitigation measures.UtilitiesRegulatory commissions may refuse to approve some or all of the utility rate increases we have requested or may request in the future, or may determine that amounts passed through to customers were not prudently incurred and therefore are not recoverable.Our regulated electric and gas utility operations are subject to cost-of-service regulation and earnings oversight from federal and state utility commissions.  This regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of desired earnings levels.  Our retail electric and gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding.  The rates that we are allowed to charge may or may not match our related costs and allowed return on invested capital at any given time.  While rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that the state public utility commissions will judge all of our costs, including our direct and allocated borrowing and debt service costs, to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that produce a full recovery of our costs and the return on invested capital allowed by the applicable state public utility commission.To some degree, each of our gas and electric utilities are permitted to recover certain costs (such as increased fuel and purchased power costs) without having to file a rate case.  To the extent we are able to pass through such costs to our customers and a state public utility commission subsequently determines that such costs should not have been paid by the customers; we may be required to refund such costs.  Any such costs not recovered through rates, or any such refund, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flow.If market or other conditions adversely affect operations or require us to make changes to our business strategy in any of our utility businesses, we may be forced to record a non-cash goodwill impairment charge.  Any significant impairment of our goodwill related to these utilities would cause a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net income and shareholders’ equity.We had approximately $1.3 billion of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016.  A substantial portion of the goodwill is related to the SourceGas Acquisition and the Aquila Transaction.  If we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect operations in any of our businesses, we may be forced to record a non-cash impairment charge, which would reduce our reported assets, net income and shareholders’ equity.  Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.  If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill in the period the determination is made.  The testing of goodwill for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions.  These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including:  future business operating performance, changes in economic conditions and interest rates, regulatory, industry or market conditions, changes in business operations, changes in competition or changes in technologies.  Any changes in key assumptions, or actual performance compared with key assumptions, about our business and its future prospects could affect the fair value of one or more business segments, which may result in an impairment charge. 62Municipal governments may seek to limit or deny franchise privileges which could inhibit our ability to secure adequate recovery of our investment in assets subject to condemnation.Municipal governments within our utility service territories possess the power of condemnation and could establish a municipal utility within a portion of our current service territories by limiting or denying franchise privileges for our operations and exercising powers of condemnation over all or part of our utility assets within municipal boundaries.  Although condemnation is a process that is subject to constitutional protections requiring just and fair compensation, as with any judicial procedure, the outcome is uncertain.  If a municipality sought to pursue this course of action, we cannot assure that we would secure adequate recovery of our investment in assets subject to condemnation.MiningIf the assumptions underlying our reclamation and mine closure obligations are materially inaccurate, our costs could be significantly greater than anticipated or be incurred sooner than anticipated.We conduct surface mining operations that are subject to operations, reclamation and closure standards.  We estimate our total reclamation liabilities based on permit requirements, engineering studies and our engineering expertise related to these requirements.  The estimate of ultimate reclamation liability is reviewed periodically by our management and engineers and by government regulators.  The estimated liability can change significantly if actual costs vary from our original assumptions or if government regulations change significantly.  GAAP requires that asset retirement obligations be recorded as a liability based on fair value, which reflects the present value of the estimated future cash flows.  In estimating future cash flows, we consider the estimated current cost of reclamation and apply inflation rates.  The resulting estimated reclamation obligations could change significantly if actual amounts or the timing of these expenses change significantly from our assumptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Estimates of the quality and quantity of our coal reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in three-dimensional structural modeling, and any inaccuracies in interpretation or modeling could materially affect the estimated quantity and quality of our reserves.The process of estimating coal reserves is uncertain and requires interpretations and modeling.  Significant inaccuracies in interpretation or modeling could materially affect the quantity and quality of our reserve estimates.  The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of engineering and geological interpretation, conditions encountered during actual reserve recovery and undetected deposit anomalies.  Variance from the assumptions used and drill hole modeling density could result in additions or deletions from our volume estimates.  In addition, future environmental, economic or geologic changes may occur or become known that require reserve revisions either upward or downward from prior reserve estimates.Oil and GasOur inability to successfully include our Oil and Gas segment core assets in utility Cost of Service Gas Programs may result in additional material impairments of our Oil and Gas assets.In our oil and gas business, we are actively divesting non-core assets while retaining those assets best suited for a Cost of Service Gas Program for our utilities and third-party utilities, and have refocused our professional staff on assisting with the implementation of a Cost of Service Gas Program.  The implementation of Cost of Service Gas Programs will provide a long-term physical hedge for a portion of a utility’s gas supply, enhancing the quality of the overall gas supply portfolio.  In addition to providing utility customers the potential benefits associated with more predictable and lower long-term natural gas prices, it also provides utilities an opportunity to increase earnings through investment in gas reserves.  Cost of Service Gas Programs require regulatory approval from state commissions that regulate utility participants in these programs.  Failure to obtain these approvals may result in additional impairments of our Oil and Gas assets, and could adversely affect the market perception of our business, operating results and stock price. 63Estimates of the quantity and value of our proved oil and gas reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves.  Significant inaccuracies in interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.The process of estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves requires interpretation of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors.  Significant variances in interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.  Actual prices, production, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves may vary significantly from those assumed in our estimates.  Any significant variance from the assumptions used could cause the actual quantity of our reserves and future net cash flow to be materially different from our estimates.  In addition, results of drilling, testing and production, changes in future capital expenditures and fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices after the date of the estimate may result in substantial upward or downward revisions that could adversely affect our results of operations.The potential adoption of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in restrictions which could increase costs and cause delays to the completion of certain oil and gas wells and potentially preclude the economic drilling and completion of wells in certain reservoirs.Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry used extensively for decades to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations.  We routinely apply hydraulic fracturing techniques on our crude oil and natural gas properties.  Hydraulic fracturing involves using mostly water, sand and a small amount of certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to enhance flow of hydrocarbons into the well-bore.  The process is typically regulated by state crude oil and natural gas commissions.  However, the EPA does assert federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities when diesel comprises part of the fracturing fluid.  In addition several agencies of the federal government including the EPA and the BLM are conducting studies of the fracturing stimulation process which may result in additional regulations.  In addition, legislation has been introduced before Congress, called the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act, to provide the federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process.In the event federal, state, local or municipal legal restrictions on the hydraulic fracturing are adopted in areas where we are conducting or in the future plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply with such regulations that may be significant, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from utilizing fracture stimulation and effectively preclude the drilling of wells.Exploratory and development drilling are speculative activities that may not result in commercially productive reserves.  Lack of drilling success could result in uneconomical investments.While our planned activity related to our Oil and Gas segment is limited, drilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered.  Drilling for oil and gas may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells, but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs.  The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain.  Our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including economic conditions, mechanical problems, pressure or irregularities in formations, title problems, weather conditions, compliance with governmental rules and regulations and shortages in or delays in the delivery of equipment and services.  Such equipment shortages and delays are caused by the high demand for rigs and other needed equipment by a large number of companies in active drilling basins.  Lack of drilling success could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We could incur additional write-downs of the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties, which would cause a decrease in our assets and stockholders' equity and could adversely impact our results of operations.We review the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties under the full cost accounting rules of the SEC on a quarterly basis, which is referred to as a ceiling test.  Under the ceiling test, capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects.  Two primary factors in the ceiling test are natural gas and crude oil reserve quantities, which are impacted by current commodity prices, and SEC-defined crude oil and gas prices, both of which impact the present value of estimated future net revenues.  We recorded non-cash impairment charges in 2016 and 2015 due to the full cost ceiling limitations.  See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 64FINANCING RISKSOur credit ratings could be lowered below investment grade in the future.  If this were to occur, it could impact our access to capital, our cost of capital and our other operating costs.Our issuer credit rating is Baa2 (Stable outlook) by Moody’s; BBB (Stable outlook) by S&P; and BBB+ (Negative outlook) by Fitch.  Reduction of our credit ratings could impair our ability to refinance or repay our existing debt and to complete new financings on reasonable terms, or at all.  A credit rating downgrade, particularly to a sub-investment grade, could also result in counterparties requiring us to post additional collateral under existing or new contracts or trades.  In addition, a ratings downgrade would increase our interest expense under some of our existing debt obligations, including borrowings under our credit facilities.Derivatives regulations included in current financial reform legislation could impede our ability to manage business and financial risks by restricting our use of derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates.Dodd-Frank contains significant derivatives regulations, including a requirement that certain transactions be cleared resulting in a requirement to post cash collateral (commonly referred to as “margin”) for such transactions.  Dodd-Frank provides for a potential exception from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end-users such as utilities and it includes a number of defined terms that will be used in determining how this exception applies to particular derivative transactions and the parties to those transactions.We use crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments for our hedging activities for our oil and gas production activities and our gas utility operations.  We also use interest rate derivative instruments to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations.  As a result of Dodd-Frank regulations promulgated by the CFTC, we may be required to post collateral to clearing entities for certain swap transactions we enter into.  In addition our exchange-traded futures contracts are subject to futures margin posting requirements, which could have a significant impact on our business by reducing our ability to execute derivative transactions to reduce commodity price and interest rate uncertainty and to protect cash flows.  Requirements to post collateral may cause significant liquidity issues by reducing our ability to use cash for investment or other corporate purposes, or may require us to increase our level of debt.  In addition, a requirement for our counterparties to post collateral could result in additional costs being passed on to us, thereby decreasing our profitability.Our hedging activities that are designed to protect against commodity price and financial market risks may cause fluctuations in reported financial results due to accounting requirements associated with such activities.We use various financial contracts and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps to manage commodity price and financial market risks.  The timing of the recognition of gains or losses on these economic hedges in accordance with GAAP does not always match up with the gains or losses on the commodities or assets being hedged.  The difference in accounting can result in volatility in reported results, even though the expected profit margin may be essentially unchanged from the dates the transactions were consummated.Our use of derivative financial instruments could result in material financial losses.From time to time, we have sought to limit a portion of the potential adverse effects resulting from changes in commodity prices and interest rates by using derivative financial instruments and other hedging mechanisms.  To the extent that we hedge our commodity price and interest rate exposures, we forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in our favor.  In addition, even though they are closely monitored by management, our hedging activities can result in losses.  Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the hedge arrangement, the hedge is economically imperfect, commodity prices or interest rates move unfavorably related to our physical or financial positions, or hedging policies and procedures are not followed. 65Market performance or changes in other assumptions could require us to make significant unplanned contributions to our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans.  Increasing costs associated with our defined benefit retirement plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.As discussed in Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have one defined benefit pension plan and several defined post-retirement healthcare plans and non-qualified retirement plans that cover certain eligible employees.  Assumptions related to future costs, return on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on our funding requirements and the expense recognized related to these plans.  These estimates and assumptions may change based on actual return on plan assets, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations.We have a holding company corporate structure with multiple subsidiaries.  Corporate dividends and debt payments are dependent upon cash distributions to the holding company from the subsidiaries.As a holding company, our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets.  Our operating cash flow and ability to service our indebtedness depend on the operating cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends or advances.  Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available for that purpose, whether by dividends or otherwise.  In addition, each subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to us depends on any applicable contractual or regulatory restrictions that may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of cash, working capital, equity or debt service funds.There is no assurance as to the amount, if any, of future dividends because they depend on our future earnings, capital requirements and financial conditions and are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.  Our operating subsidiaries have certain restrictions on their ability to transfer funds in the form of dividends or loans to us.  See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these restrictions and their impact on our liquidity.We may be unable to obtain financing on reasonable terms needed to refinance debt, fund planned capital expenditures or otherwise execute our operating strategy.Our ability to execute our operating strategy is highly dependent upon our access to capital.  Historically, we have addressed our liquidity needs (including funds required to make scheduled principal and interest payments, refinance debt and fund working capital and planned capital expenditures) with operating cash flow, borrowings under credit facilities, proceeds of debt and equity offerings, and proceeds from asset sales.  Our ability to access the capital markets and the costs and terms of available financing depend on many factors, including changes in our credit ratings, changes in the federal or state regulatory environment affecting energy companies, volatility in commodity or electricity prices, and general economic and market conditions.In addition, because we are a holding company and our utility assets are owned by our subsidiaries, if we are unable to adequately access the credit markets, we could be required to take additional measures designed to ensure that our utility subsidiaries are adequately capitalized to provide safe and reliable service.  Possible additional measures would be evaluated in the context of then-prevailing market conditions, prudent financial management and any applicable regulatory requirements.National and regional economic conditions may cause increased counterparty credit risk, late payments and uncollectible accounts, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.A future recession may lead to an increase in late payments from retail, commercial and industrial utility customers, as well as from our non-utility customers.  If late payments and uncollectible accounts increase, earnings and cash flows from our continuing operations may be reduced. 66Our ability to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers.  Our insurance coverage may not provide protection against all significant losses.Our ability to obtain insurance, as well as the cost of such insurance, could be affected by developments affecting insurance businesses, international, national, state or local events, as well as the financial condition of insurers.  Insurance coverage may not continue to be available at all, or at rates or on terms similar to those presently available to us.  A loss for which we are not fully insured could materially and adversely affect our financial results.  Our insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which the Company may be subject, including but not limited to environmental hazards, fire-related liability from natural events or inadequate facility maintenance, risks associated with our oil and gas exploration and production activities, distribution property losses, cyber-security risks and dangers that exist in the gathering and transportation of gas in pipelines.While we maintain insurance coverage for our operated wells and we participate in insurance coverage maintained by the operators of our wells, there can be no assurances that such coverage will be sufficient to prevent a material adverse effect to us if any of the foregoing events occur.Increasing costs associated with our health care plans and other benefits may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.The costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees have increased substantially in recent years.  We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs related to health care plans for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise.  Significant regulatory developments have, and likely will continue to, require changes to our current employee benefit plans and in our administrative and accounting processes, as well as changes to the cost of our plans, and the  increasing costs and funding requirements associated with our health care plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.Our electric and gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding.  Within our utility rates we have generally recovered the cost of providing employee benefits.  As benefit costs continue to rise, there can be no assurance that the state public utility commissions will allow recovery.An effective system of internal control may not be maintained, leading to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.Prior to the Acquisition, SourceGas was a private company, exempt from reporting and control requirements under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  As permitted by the guidance set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the acquired SourceGas businesses are not included in management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2016. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management to make an assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal controls.  Our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of these controls.  During their assessment of these controls, management or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify areas of weakness in control design or effectiveness, which may lead to the conclusion that a material weakness in internal control exists.  Any control deficiencies we identify in the future could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis, which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports or have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business or access sources of liquidity.A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met.  While we expect our control system to adequately integrate the SourceGas processes, we cannot be certain that our current design for internal control over financial reporting, or any additional changes to be made, will be sufficient to enable management to determine that our internal controls are effective for any period, or on an ongoing basis.  If we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, market perception of our business, operating results and stock price could be adversely affected. 67ENVIRONMENTAL RISKSFederal and state laws concerning greenhouse gas regulations and air emissions may materially increase our generation and production costs and could render some of our generating units uneconomical to operate and maintain.We own and operate regulated and non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants in South Dakota, Wyoming and Colorado.  Recent developments under federal and state laws and regulations governing air emissions from fossil-fuel generating plants may result in more stringent emission limitations, which could have a material impact on our costs of operations.  Various pending or final state and EPA regulations that will impact our facilities are also discussed in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption “Environmental Matters.”The GHG Tailoring Rule, effective June 2010, will impact us in the event of a major modification at an existing facility or in the event of a new major source as defined by EPA regulations.  Upon renewal of operating permits for existing facilities, monitoring and reporting requirements will be implemented.  New projects or major modifications to existing projects will result in a Best Available Control Technology review that could impose more stringent emissions control practices and technologies.  The EPA’s GHG New Source Performance Standard for new steam electric generating units, published October 2015, effectively prohibits new coal-fired units until carbon capture and sequestration becomes technically and economically feasible.On October 23, 2015, the EPA finalized the CPP to cut carbon emissions from existing electric generating units.  The design of the CPP is to decrease existing coal-fired generation, increase the utilization of existing gas generation, increase renewable energy and demand side management.  The rule, which does not propose to regulate individual emission sources, calls for each state to develop plans to meet the EPA-assigned statewide average emission rate target for that state by 2030.  The rule also allows states to formulate a regional approach whereby they would join with other states and be assigned a new single target for the group.  The U.S. Supreme Court entered an order staying the CPP in February 2016, pending appeal.  The effect of the order is to delay the CPP’s compliance deadlines until challenges to the CPP have been fully litigated and the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled.  In 2015 and again in 2016, we met with the staff of state air programs and public utility commissions on several occasions.  We will continue to work closely with state regulatory staff as these plans develop.Due to uncertainty as to the final outcome of federal climate change legislation, legal challenges, state clean power plan developments or regulatory changes under the Clean Air Act, we cannot definitively estimate the effect of GHG legislation or regulation on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.New or more stringent regulations or other energy efficiency requirements could require us to incur significant additional costs relating to, among other things, the installation of additional emission control equipment, the acceleration of capital expenditures, the purchase of additional emissions allowances or offsets, the acquisition or development of additional energy supply from renewable resources, the closure or reduction of load of coal generating facilities and potential increased load of our combined cycle natural gas fired units.  To the extent our regulated fossil-fuel generating plants are included in rate base we will attempt to recover costs associated with complying with emission standards or other requirements.  We will also attempt to recover the emission compliance costs of our non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants from utility and other purchasers of the power generated by those non-regulated power plants.  Any unrecovered costs could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, future changes in environmental regulations governing air emissions could render some of our power generating units more expensive or uneconomical to operate and maintain.The costs to achieve or maintain compliance with existing or future governmental laws, regulations or requirements, and any failure to do so, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.Our business is subject to extensive energy, environmental and other laws and regulations of federal, state, tribal and local authorities.  We generally must obtain and comply with a variety of regulations, licenses, permits and other approvals in order to operate, which can require significant capital expenditure and operating costs.  If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to civil or criminal liability and the imposition of penalties, liens or fines, claims for property damage or personal injury, or environmental clean-up costs.  In addition, existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities, which could require additional unexpected expenditures or cause us to reevaluate the feasibility of continued operations at certain sites and have a detrimental effect on our business. 68In connection with certain acquisitions, we assumed liabilities associated with the environmental condition of certain properties, regardless of when such liabilities arose, whether known or unknown, and in some cases agreed to indemnify the former owners of those properties for environmental liabilities.  Future steps to bring our facilities into compliance or to address contamination from legacy operations, if necessary, could be expensive and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Environmental compliance expenditures could be substantial in the future if the trend towards stricter standards, greater regulation, more extensive permitting requirements and an increase in the number of assets we operate continues.The characteristics of coal may make it difficult for coal users to comply with various environmental standards related to coal combustion or utilization and the use of alternative energy sources for power generation as mandated by states could reduce coal consumption.Future regulations may require further reductions in emissions of mercury, hazardous pollutants, SO2, NOx, volatile organic compounds, particulate matter and GHG, which are released into the air when coal is burned.  These requirements could require the installation of costly emission control technology or the implementation of other measures.  Reductions in mercury emissions required by EPA’s MATS rule described earlier, will likely require some power plants to install new equipment, at substantial cost, or discourage the use of certain coals containing higher levels of mercury.  The EPA’s October 23, 2015 CPP described earlier, which has been stayed pending appeal, is designed to reduce carbon emissions from existing electric generating units.  The basis of the CPP is to decrease existing coal-fired generation, increase the utilization of existing gas fired combined cycle generation, increase renewable energy and demand side management.  This rule could have a significant impact on our coal and natural gas generating fleet.  The rule calls for states to develop plans to meet their assigned emission rate targets by 2030.  The rule also allows states to formulate a regional approach whereby they would join with other states and be assigned a new single target for the group.Coal competes with other energy sources, such as natural gas, wind, solar and hydropower.  The CPP regulation is expected to have an adverse effect on coal as a domestic energy source, and could have a significant impact on our mining operations.Existing or proposed legislation focusing on emissions enacted by the United States or individual states could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative for our customers and could impose a tax or fee on the producer of the coal.  If our customers decrease the volume of coal they purchase from us or switch to alternative fuels as a result of existing or future environmental regulations aimed at reducing emissions, our operations and financial results could be adversely impacted"
0,BKH,BLACK HILLS CORP,2016-02-25,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSThe nature of our business subjects us to a number of uncertainties and risks.  The following risk factors and other risk factors that we discuss in our periodic reports filed with the SEC should be considered for a better understanding of our Company.  These important factors and other matters discussed herein could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ materially.OPERATING RISKSOur current or future development, expansion and acquisition activities may not be successful, which could impair our ability to execute our growth strategy.Execution of our future growth plan is dependent on successful ongoing and future development, expansion and acquisition activities.  We can provide no assurance that we will be able to complete development projects or acquisitions we undertake or continue to develop attractive opportunities for growth.  Factors that could cause our development, expansion and acquisition activities to be unsuccessful include:•Our inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals or the imposition of adverse conditions upon the approval of any acquisition;•Our inability to secure adequate utility rates through regulatory proceedings;•Our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all;•The possibility that one or more credit rating agencies would downgrade our issuer credit rating to below investment grade, thus increasing our cost of doing business;•Our inability to successfully integrate any businesses we acquire;•Our inability to attract and retain management or other key personnel;•Our inability to negotiate acceptable acquisition, construction, fuel supply, power sales or other material agreements;•The trend of utilities building their own generation or looking for developers to develop and build projects for sale to utilities under turnkey arrangements;•Reduced growth in the demand for utility services in the markets we serve;•Changes in federal, state, local or tribal laws and regulations, particularly those which would make it more difficult or costly to fully develop our coal reserves, our oil and gas reserves and our generation capacity;•Fuel prices or fuel supply constraints;•Pipeline capacity and transmission constraints; 54•Competition within our industry and with producers of competing energy sources; and•Changes in tax rates and policies.Our financial performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities.  If the risks involved in our operations are not appropriately managed or mitigated, our operations may not be successful and this could adversely affect our results of operations.Operating electric generating facilities, oil and gas properties, the coal mine and electric and natural gas distribution systems involves risks, including:•Operational limitations imposed by environmental and other regulatory requirements;•Interruptions to supply of fuel and other commodities used in generation and distribution.  The Utilities Group purchases fuel from a number of suppliers.  Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the delivery of fuel due to various factors, including but not limited to, transportation delays, labor relations, weather and environmental regulations, which could limit the Utilities Group’s ability to operate their facilities;•Breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, including those operated by PacifiCorp at the Wyodak plant;•Our ability to transition and replace our retirement-eligible utility employees.  At December 31, 2015, approximately 25% of our Utilities Group employees were eligible for regular or early retirement;•Inability to recruit and retain skilled technical labor;•Disrupted transmission and distribution.  We depend on transmission and distribution facilities, including those operated by unaffiliated parties, to deliver the electricity and gas that we sell to our retail and wholesale customers.  If transmission is interrupted, our ability to sell or deliver product and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered;•Operating hazards such as leaks, mechanical problems and accidents, including explosions, affecting our natural gas distribution system which could impact public safety, reliability and customer confidence;•Electricity is dangerous for employees and the general public should they come in contact with power lines or electrical service facilities and equipment.  Natural conditions and other disasters such as wind, lightning and winter storms can cause wildfires, pole failures and associated property damage and outages;•Disruption in the functioning of our information technology and network infrastructure which are vulnerable to disability, failures and unauthorized access.  If our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions; and•Labor relations.  Approximately 29% of our employees are represented by a total of six collective bargaining agreements.Construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve significant risks which could reduce profitability.The construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve many risks, including:•The inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals along with the cost of complying with or satisfying conditions imposed upon such approvals;•Contractual restrictions upon the timing of scheduled outages;•The cost of supplying or securing replacement power during scheduled and unscheduled outages;•The unavailability or increased cost of equipment; 55•The cost of recruiting and retaining or the unavailability of skilled labor;•Supply interruptions, work stoppages and labor disputes;•Increased capital and operating costs to comply with increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations;•Opposition by members of public or special-interest groups;•Weather interferences;•Availability and cost of fuel supplies;•Unexpected engineering, environmental and geological problems; and•Unanticipated cost overruns.The ongoing operation of our facilities involves many of the risks described above, in addition to risks relating to the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency.  New plants may employ recently developed and technologically complex equipment, including newer environmental emission control technology.  Any of these risks could cause us to operate below expected capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues, increase expenses or cause us to incur higher operating and maintenance costs and penalties.  While we maintain insurance, obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance and our rights under warranties or performance guarantees may not be timely or adequate to cover lost revenues, increased expenses, liability or liquidated damage payments.Operating results can be adversely affected by variations from normal weather conditions.Our utility businesses are seasonal businesses and weather patterns can have a material impact on our operating performance.  Demand for electricity is typically greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating.  Because natural gas is primarily used for residential and commercial heating, the demand for this product depends heavily upon winter weather patterns throughout our service territory and a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating seasons.  Accordingly, our utility operations have historically generated lower revenues and income when weather conditions are cooler than normal in the summer and warmer than normal in the winter.  Unusually mild summers and winters therefore could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our businesses are located in areas that could be subject to seasonal natural disasters such as severe snow and ice storms, flooding and wildfires.  These factors could result in interruption of our business, damage to our property such as power lines and substations and repair and clean-up costs associated with these storms.  We may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring transmission and distribution property following these natural disasters through a change in our regulated rates thereby resulting in a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our coal mining operations are subject to operating risks that are beyond our control which could affect our profitability and production levels.  Our surface mining operations could be disrupted or materially affected due to adverse weather or natural disasters such as heavy snow, strong winds, rain or flooding.  Additionally, weather patterns can also affect electricity demand.  Extreme temperatures, both hot and cold, cause increased power usage, and therefore, increased generating requirements and the use of coal.  Conversely, mild temperatures could result in lower electrical demand.Weather conditions can also limit or temporarily halt our drilling, completion and producing activities and other crude oil and natural gas operations.  Primarily in the winter and spring, our operations can be curtailed because of cold, snow and wet conditions.  Severe weather could further curtail these operations, including drilling, and completion of new wells or production from existing wells.  In addition, weather conditions and other events could temporarily impair our ability to transport our crude oil and natural gas production. 56Prices for some of our products and services as well as a portion of our operating costs are volatile and may cause our revenues and expenses to fluctuate significantly.A portion of our net income is attributable to sales of contract and off-system wholesale electricity and natural gas.  Energy prices are influenced by many factors outside our control, including, among other things, fuel prices, transmission constraints, supply and demand, weather, general economic conditions, and the rules, regulations and actions of system operators in those markets.  Moreover, unlike most other commodities, electricity cannot be stored and therefore must be produced concurrently with its use.  As a result, wholesale power markets may be subject to significant, unpredictable price fluctuations over relatively short periods of time.The success of our crude oil and natural gas operations is affected by the prevailing market prices of crude oil and natural gas.  Crude oil and natural gas prices and markets historically have been, and are likely to continue to be, unpredictable.  A decrease in crude oil or natural gas prices would not only reduce revenues and profits, but would also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable and may result in charges to earnings for impairment of the net capitalized cost of these assets.  Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for crude oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control.The proliferation of domestic crude oil and natural gas shale plays in recent years has provided the market with an abundant new supply of crude oil and natural gas.  The increase in domestic natural gas supply has driven prices down in recent years.  The ratio of crude oil to natural gas prices remains at high levels, far in excess of the six to one heating value equivalent ratio.  There is also risk that the increased domestic crude oil resources could drive crude oil prices lower.Our mining operation requires reliable supplies of replacement parts, explosives, fuel, tires and steel-related products.  If the cost of these increase significantly, or if sources of supplies and mining equipment become unavailable to meet our replacement demands, our productivity and profitability could be lower than our current expectations.  In recent years, industry-wide demand growth exceeded supply growth for certain surface mining equipment and off-the-road tires.  As a result, lead times for procuring some items generally increased to several months and prices for these items increased significantly.Our operations rely on storage and transportation assets owned by third parties to satisfy our obligations.  If storage capacity is inadequate or transportation is disrupted, our ability to satisfy our obligations may be hindered.Our Utilities Group and Power Generation segment rely on pipeline companies and other owners of gas storage facilities to deliver natural gas to ratepayers, to supply our natural gas-fired power plants and to hedge commodity costs.  If storage capacity is inadequate or transportation is disrupted, our ability to satisfy our obligations may be hindered.  As a result, we may be responsible for damages incurred by our counterparties, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at then-current market rates, or for penalties imposed by state regulatory authorities.Threats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt our businesses, or the businesses of third parties, may impact our operations in unpredictable ways and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.We are subject to the potentially adverse operating and financial effects of terrorist acts and threats and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups.  Our generation, transmission and distribution facilities, fuel storage facilities, information technology systems and other infrastructure facilities and systems and physical assets, could be direct targets of, or indirectly affected by, such activities.  Terrorist acts or other similar events could harm our businesses by limiting their ability to generate, purchase or transmit power and by delaying their development and construction of new generating facilities and capital improvements to existing facilities.  These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair and insure our assets and could adversely affect our operations by contributing to disruption of supplies and markets for natural gas, oil and other fuels.  They could also impair our ability to raise capital by contributing to financial instability and lower economic activity.The implementation of security guidelines and measures and maintenance of insurance, to the extent available, addressing such activities could increase costs.  These types of events could materially adversely affect our financial results.  In addition, these types of events could require significant management attention and resources and could adversely affect our reputation among customers and the public. 57A disruption of the regional electric transmission grid, natural gas pipeline infrastructure or other fuel sources, could negatively impact our business.  Because generation, transmission systems and natural gas pipelines are part of an interconnected system, we face the risk of possible loss of business due to a disruption caused by the impact of an event on the interconnected system (such as severe weather or a generator or transmission facility outage, pipeline rupture, or a sudden significant increase or decrease in wind generation) within our system or within a neighboring system.  Any such disruption could have a material impact on our financial results.A cyber attack may disrupt our operations, or lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information and create a potential liability.We operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continuous use and operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure.  In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we collect and retain sensitive information including personal information about our customers and employees.  Cyber attacks targeting our electronic control systems used at our generating facilities and for electric and gas distribution systems, could result in a full or partial disruption of our electric and/or gas operations.  Cyber attacks targeting other key information technology systems could further add to a full or partial disruption to our operations.  Any disruption of these operations could result in a loss of service to customers and a significant decrease in revenues, as well as significant expense to repair system damage and remedy security breaches.  Any theft, loss and/or fraudulent use of customer, shareowner, employee or proprietary data as a result of a cyber attack could subject us to significant litigation, liability and costs, as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators, among others.We have instituted security measures and safeguards to protect our operational systems and information technology assets.  FERC, through the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, requires certain safeguards be implemented to deter cyber attacks.  The security measures and safeguards we have implemented may not always be effective due to the evolving nature and sophistication of cyber attacks.  Despite our implementation of security measures and safeguards, all of our information technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access, including cyber attacks.  If our information technology systems were to fail or be breached by a cyber attack or a computer virus and be unable to recover in a timely way, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions and sensitive confidential and other data could be compromised which could have a material adverse effect not only on our financial results, but on our public reputation as well.Increased risks of regulatory penalties could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.Business activities in the energy sector are heavily regulated, primarily by agencies of the federal government.  Agencies that historically sought voluntary compliance, or issued non-monetary sanctions, now employ mandatory civil penalty structures for regulatory violations.  The FERC, CFTC, EPA, OSHA, SEC and MSHA may impose significant civil and criminal penalties to enforce compliance requirements relative to our business.  In addition, FERC delegated certain aspects of authority for enforcement of electric system reliability standards to the NERC, with similar penalty authority for violations.  If a serious regulatory violation occurred and penalties were imposed by FERC or another federal agency, this action could have a material adverse effect on our operations and/or our financial results.Certain Federal laws, including the Migratory Bird Act and the Endangered Species Act, provide special protection to certain designated species.  These laws and any state equivalents provide for significant civil and criminal penalties for non-permitted activities that result in harm to or harassment of certain protected animals, including damage to their habitats.  If such species are located in an area in which we conduct operations, or if additional species in those areas become subject to protection, our operations and development projects, particularly transmission, generation, wind, pipeline or drilling projects, could be restricted or delayed, or we could be required to implement expensive mitigation measures. 58Our energy production, transmission and distribution activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other catastrophic events.  These events could disrupt or impair our operations, create additional costs and cause substantial loss to us.Inherent in our natural gas and electricity transmission and distribution activities, as well as our production, transportation and storage of crude oil and natural gas and our coal mining operations, are a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, blow-outs, fires, releases of hazardous materials, explosions and mechanical problems that could cause substantial adverse financial impacts.  These events could result in injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property or natural resources (including public parks), environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us.  In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses.  The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.  Particularly for our transmission and distribution lines located near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering areas, the damages resulting from any such events could be significant.UtilitiesRegulatory commissions may refuse to approve some or all of the utility rate increases we have requested or may request in the future, or may determine that amounts passed through to customers were not prudently incurred and therefore are not recoverable, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.Our regulated electric and gas utility operations are subject to cost-of-service regulation and earnings oversight from federal and state utility commissions.  This regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of desired earnings levels.  Our retail electric and gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding.  The rates that we are allowed to charge may or may not match our related costs and allowed return on invested capital at any given time.  While rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that the state public utility commissions will judge all of our costs, including our direct and allocated borrowing and debt service costs, to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that produce a full recovery of our costs and the return on invested capital allowed by the applicable state public utility commission.To some degree, each of our gas and electric utilities are permitted to recover certain costs (such as increased fuel and purchased power costs) without having to file a rate case.  To the extent we are able to pass through such costs to our customers and a state public utility commission subsequently determines that such costs should not have been paid by the customers; we may be required to refund such costs.  Any such costs not recovered through rates, or any such refund, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flow.If regulatory commissions refuse to approve the implementation of a Cost of Service Gas Program to serve our natural gas utilities and the fuel needs of our electric utilities, it could adversely affect future operations or require us to make changes to our business strategy.We have submitted applications with respective state utility regulators seeking approval for a Cost of Service Gas Program in Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, Colorado and Wyoming.  The implementation of a Cost of Service Gas Program supports our natural gas and electric utilities and provides longer-term price stability for our regulated customers by enhancing our current utility gas supply portfolio, through the addition of affiliate owned natural gas production and reserves.  In addition to providing our customers the benefits associated with more predictable long-term natural gas prices, it also provides additional opportunities for increased earnings.  We will require regulatory approval from our state commissions to implement this program.  If regulatory commissions refuse to approve the program, we may have to reconsider our long-term oil and gas strategy. 59If market or other conditions adversely affect operations or require us to make changes to our business strategy in any of our utility businesses, we may be forced to record a non-cash goodwill impairment charge.  Any significant impairment of our goodwill related to these utilities would cause a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net income and shareholders’ equity.We had approximately $360 million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015.  A substantial portion of the goodwill is related to the Aquila Transaction.  If we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect operations in any of our businesses, we may be forced to record a non-cash impairment charge, which would reduce our reported assets, net income and shareholders’ equity.  Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.  If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill in the period the determination is made.  The testing of goodwill for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions.  These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including:  future business operating performance, changes in economic conditions and interest rates, regulatory, industry or market conditions, changes in business operations, changes in competition or changes in technologies.  Any changes in key assumptions, or actual performance compared with key assumptions, about our business and its future prospects could affect the fair value of one or more business segments, which may result in an impairment charge.Municipal governments may seek to limit or deny franchise privileges which could inhibit our ability to secure adequate recovery of our investment in assets subject to condemnation.Municipal governments within our utility service territories possess the power of condemnation and could establish a municipal utility within a portion of our current service territories by limiting or denying franchise privileges for our operations and exercising powers of condemnation over all or part of our utility assets within municipal boundaries.  Although condemnation is a process that is subject to constitutional protections requiring just and fair compensation, as with any judicial procedure, the outcome is uncertain.  If a municipality sought to pursue this course of action, we cannot assure that we would secure adequate recovery of our investment in assets subject to condemnation.Coal MiningIf the assumptions underlying our reclamation and mine closure obligations are materially inaccurate, our costs could be significantly greater than anticipated or be incurred sooner than anticipated.Our mining consists of surface mining operations.  The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and similar state laws and regulation establish operations, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining.  We estimate our total reclamation liabilities based on permit requirements, engineering studies and our engineering expertise related to these requirements.  The estimate of ultimate reclamation liability is reviewed periodically by our management and engineers and by government regulators.  The estimated liability can change significantly if actual costs vary from our original assumptions or if government regulations change significantly.  GAAP requires that asset retirement obligations be recorded as a liability based on fair value, which reflects the present value of the estimated future cash flows.  In estimating future cash flows, we consider the estimated current cost of reclamation and apply inflation rates.  The resulting estimated reclamation obligations could change significantly if actual amounts or the timing of these expenses change significantly from our assumptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Estimates of the quality and quantity of our coal reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in three dimensional structural modeling.  Significant inaccuracies in interpretation or modeling could materially affect the estimated quantity and quality of our reserve which could adversely affect our results of operations.There are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of coal reserves.  The process of coal volume estimation requires interpretations of drill hole log data and subsequent computer modeling of the intersected deposit.  Significant inaccuracies in interpretation or modeling could materially affect the quantity and quality of our reserve estimates.  The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of engineering and geological interpretation, conditions encountered during actual reserve recovery and undetected deposit anomalies.  Variance from the assumptions used and drill hole modeling density could result in additions or deletions from our volume estimates.  In addition, future environmental, economic or geologic changes may occur or become known that require reserve revisions either upward or downward from prior reserve estimates. 60Oil and GasEstimates of the quantity and value of our proved oil and gas reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves.  Significant inaccuracies in interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves which could adversely affect our results of operations.There are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and their associated value.  The process of estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves requires interpretation of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors.  Significant inaccuracies in interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.  The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretations and judgment and the assumptions used regarding quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves, future capital expenditures and prices for crude oil and natural gas.  Actual prices, production, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves may vary from those assumed in our estimates.  These variances may be significant.  Any significant variance from the assumptions used could cause the actual quantity of our reserves and future net cash flow to be materially different from our estimates.  In addition, results of drilling, testing and production, changes in future capital expenditures and fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices after the date of the estimate may result in substantial upward or downward revisions.The potential adoption of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in restrictions which could increase costs and cause delays to the completion of certain oil and gas wells and potentially preclude the economic drilling and completion of wells in certain reservoirs.Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry used extensively for decades to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations.  We routinely apply hydraulic fracturing techniques on our crude oil and natural gas properties.  Hydraulic fracturing involves using mostly water, sand and a small amount of certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to enhance flow of hydrocarbons into the well-bore.  The process is typically regulated by state crude oil and natural gas commissions; however, the EPA does assert federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities when diesel comprises part of the fracturing fluid.  In addition several agencies of the federal government including the EPA and the BLM are conducting studies of the fracturing stimulation process which may result in additional regulations.  On March 20, 2015 the U.S. Department of Interior's BLM issued a final rule regulating the use of hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian Lands.  Subsequently on September 30, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming issued a preliminary injunction preventing the BLM from enforcing the final rule.  In addition, legislation has been introduced before Congress, called the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act, to provide the federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process.Certain states have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether.  In the event federal, state, local or municipal legal restrictions on the hydraulic fracturing are adopted in areas where we are conducting or in the future plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply with such regulations that may be significant, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from utilizing fracture stimulation and effectively preclude the drilling of wells. 61Exploratory and development drilling are speculative activities that may not result in commercially productive reserves.  Lack of drilling success could result in uneconomical investments and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Drilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered.  There can be no assurance that new wells drilled by us or in which we have an interest will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment.  Drilling for oil and gas may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells, but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs.  The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain.  Our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including economic conditions, mechanical problems, pressure or irregularities in formations, title problems, weather conditions, compliance with governmental rules and regulations and shortages in or delays in the delivery of equipment and services.  Such equipment shortages and delays are caused by the high demand for rigs and other needed equipment by a large number of companies in active drilling basins.  High activity in some basins may cause shortages of rigs and equipment in other basins.  Our future drilling activities may not be successful.  Lack of drilling success could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We could incur additional and substantial write-downs of the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties, which would cause a decrease in our assets and stockholders' equity and could adversely impact our results of operations.We review the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties under the full cost accounting rules of the SEC on a quarterly basis.  This quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test.  Under the ceiling test, capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects.  In calculating future net revenues, SEC-defined commodity prices and recent costs are utilized.  Such prices and costs are utilized except when different prices and costs are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts.  Two primary factors in the ceiling test are natural gas and crude oil reserve quantities and SEC-defined crude oil and gas prices, both of which impact the present value of estimated future net revenues.  Revisions to estimates of natural gas and crude oil reserves, or an increase or decrease in prices, can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues.  The amount by which net book value, less deferred income tax, exceeds the tax adjusted net present value of reserves is written off as an expense.We recorded a non-cash impairment charge in 2015 due to the full cost ceiling limitations.  Using our year-end reserve information and holding all other variables constant, a price sensitivity analysis indicates it is probable a ceiling impairment charge will occur in 2016 if crude oil and natural gas prices remain at or near the low levels experienced in late 2015 and early 2016.  See Note 13 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.FINANCING RISKSOur credit ratings could be lowered below investment grade in the future.  If this were to occur, it could impact our access to capital, our cost of capital and our other operating costs.Our issuer credit rating is Baa1 (Negative outlook) by Moody’s; BBB (Stable outlook) by S&P; and BBB+ (Negative outlook) by Fitch.  Reduction of our credit ratings could impair our ability to refinance or repay our existing debt and to complete new financings on reasonable terms, or at all.  A credit rating downgrade, particularly to a sub-investment grade, could also result in counterparties requiring us to post additional collateral under existing or new contracts or trades.  In addition, a ratings downgrade would increase our interest expense under some of our existing debt obligations, including borrowings under our credit facilities.Derivatives regulations included in current financial reform legislation could impede our ability to manage business and financial risks by restricting our use of derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates.In July 2010, Dodd-Frank was passed by Congress and signed into law.  Dodd-Frank contains significant derivatives regulations, including a requirement that certain transactions be cleared resulting in a requirement to post cash collateral (commonly referred to as “margin”) for such transactions.  Dodd-Frank provides for a potential exception from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end-users such as utilities and it includes a number of defined terms that will be used in determining how this exception applies to particular derivative transactions and the parties to those transactions. 62We use crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments for our hedging activities for our oil and gas production activities and our gas utility operations.  We also use interest rate derivative instruments to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations.  As a result of Dodd-Frank regulations promulgated by the CFTC, we may be required to post collateral to clearing entities for certain swap transactions we enter into.  In addition, many of the transactions which were previously classified as swaps have been converted to exchange-traded futures contracts, which are subject to futures margin posting requirements.  Such a requirement could have a significant impact on our business by reducing our ability to execute derivative transactions to reduce commodity price and interest rate uncertainty and to protect cash flows.  Requirements to post collateral may cause significant liquidity issues by reducing our ability to use cash for investment or other corporate purposes, or may require us to increase our level of debt.  In addition, a requirement for our counterparties to post collateral could result in additional costs being passed on to us, thereby decreasing our profitability.Our hedging activities that are designed to protect against commodity price and financial market risks may cause fluctuations in reported financial results due to accounting requirements associated with such activities.We use various financial contracts and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps to manage commodity price and financial market risks.  The timing of the recognition of gains or losses on these economic hedges in accordance with GAAP does not always match up with the gains or losses on the commodities or assets being hedged.  The difference in accounting can result in volatility in reported results, even though the expected profit margin may be essentially unchanged from the dates the transactions were consummated.Our use of derivative financial instruments could result in material financial losses.From time to time, we have sought to limit a portion of the potential adverse effects resulting from changes in commodity prices and interest rates by using derivative financial instruments and other hedging mechanisms.  To the extent that we hedge our commodity price and interest rate exposures, we forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in our favor.  In addition, even though they are closely monitored by management, our hedging activities can result in losses.  Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the hedge arrangement, the hedge is economically imperfect, commodity prices or interest rates move unfavorably related to our physical or financial positions, or hedging policies and procedures are not followed.Market performance or changes in other assumptions could require us to make significant unplanned contributions to our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans.  Increasing costs associated with our defined benefit retirement plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.We have two defined benefit pension plans and three non-pension postretirement plans that cover certain eligible employees.  Assumptions related to future costs, return on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on our funding requirements and the expense recognized related to these plans.  These estimates and assumptions may change based on actual return on plan assets, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations.We have a holding company corporate structure with multiple subsidiaries.  Corporate dividends and debt payments are dependent upon cash distributions to the holding company from the subsidiaries.  The subsidiaries may not be allowed or may be unable to make dividend payments or loan funds to the holding company, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations or pay dividends to our shareholders.We are a holding company.  Our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets.  Our operating cash flow and ability to service our indebtedness depend on the operating cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends or advances.  Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available for that purpose, whether by dividends or otherwise.  In addition, each subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to us depends on any applicable contractual or regulatory restrictions that may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of cash, working capital, equity or debt service funds.We expect to continue our policy of paying regular cash dividends.  However, there is no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on our future earnings, capital requirements and financial conditions and are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.  Our operating subsidiaries have certain restrictions on their ability to transfer funds in the form of dividends or loans to us.  See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these restrictions and their impact on our liquidity. 63We may be unable to obtain the financing needed to refinance debt, fund planned capital expenditures or otherwise execute our operating strategy.  Lack of credit at reasonable rates would have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.Our ability to execute our operating strategy is highly dependent upon our access to capital.  Historically, we have addressed our liquidity needs (including funds required to make scheduled principal and interest payments, refinance debt and fund working capital and planned capital expenditures) with operating cash flow, borrowings under credit facilities, proceeds of debt and equity offerings and proceeds from asset sales.  Our ability to access the capital markets and the costs and terms of available financing depend on many factors, including changes in our credit ratings, changes in the federal or state regulatory environment affecting energy companies, volatility in commodity or electricity prices and general economic and market conditions.In addition, because we are a holding company and our utility assets are owned by our subsidiaries, if we are unable to adequately access the credit markets, we could be required to take additional measures designed to ensure that our utility subsidiaries are adequately capitalized to provide safe and reliable service.  Possible additional measures would be evaluated in the context of then-prevailing market conditions, prudent financial management and any applicable regulatory requirements.National and regional economic conditions may cause increased counterparty credit risk, late payments and uncollectible accounts, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.A future recession may lead to an increase in late payments from retail, commercial and industrial utility customers, as well as our non-utility customers.  If late payments and uncollectible accounts increase, earnings and cash flows from our continuing operations may be reduced.Our ability to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers.  Our insurance coverage may not provide protection against all significant losses.Our ability to obtain insurance, as well as the cost of such insurance, could be affected by developments affecting insurance businesses, international, national, state or local events, as well as the financial condition of insurers.  Insurance coverage may not continue to be available at all, or at rates or on terms similar to those presently available to us.  A loss for which we are not fully insured could materially and adversely affect our financial results.  Our insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which the Company may be subject, including but not limited to environmental hazards, fire-related liability from natural events or inadequate facility maintenance, risks associated with our oil and gas exploration and production activities, distribution property losses, cyber-security risks and dangers that exist in the gathering and transportation in pipelines.Our operations are also subject to all the hazards and risks normally incident to the development, exploitation, production and transportation of, and the exploration for, oil and gas, including unusual or unexpected geologic formations, pressures, down hole fires, mechanical failures, blowouts, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, gas or well fluids, pollution and other environmental risks.  These hazards could result in substantial losses to us due to injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution and other environmental damage and suspension of operations.  We maintain insurance coverage for our operated wells and we participate in insurance coverage maintained by the operators of our wells, although there can be no assurances that such coverage will be sufficient to prevent a material adverse effect to us if any of the foregoing events occur.Increasing costs associated with our health care plans and other benefits may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.The costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees have increased substantially in recent years.  We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs related to health care plans for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise.  The increasing costs and funding requirements associated with our health care plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 64In March 2010, the President of the United States signed PPACA as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “2010 Acts”).  The 2010 Acts will have a substantial impact on health care providers, insurers, employers and individuals.  The 2010 Acts will impact employers and businesses differently depending on the size of the organization and the specific impacts on a company’s employees.  Certain provisions of the 2010 Acts are effective while other provisions of the 2010 Acts will be effective in future years.  The 2010 Acts could require, among other things, changes to our current employee benefit plans and in our administrative and accounting processes, as well as changes to the cost of our plans.  The ultimate extent and cost of these changes cannot be determined at this time and are being evaluated and updated as related regulations and interpretations of the 2010 Acts become available.Our electric and gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding.  Within our utility rates we have generally recovered the cost of providing employee benefits.  As benefit costs continue to rise, there can be no assurance that the state public utility commissions will allow recovery.We have deferred a substantial amount of income tax related to various tax planning strategies, including the deferral of a gain associated with the assets sold in the 2008 IPP Transaction.  If the Internal Revenue Service successfully challenges these tax positions, our results of operations, financial position or liquidity could be adversely affected.We have deferred a substantial amount of tax payments through various tax planning strategies including the deferral of approximately $125 million in income taxes associated with a like-kind exchange related to the IPP Transaction and the Aquila Transaction.The IRS has challenged our position with respect to the like-kind exchange.  As stated in a revised Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) received from the IRS in April 2013, their position is to disallow a significant portion of the gain deferred as reported on our originally filed 2008 tax return.  A 30 Day Letter along with a Revenue Agent's Report were received on July 30, 2014, indicating no change in the IRS’ position.  We disagree with such a position and will pursue all available IRS and/or legal channels to challenge the proposed adjustment.  A protest was timely filed with IRS Appeals in August 2014.   In the event we are unsuccessful in our challenge, the amount of deferred income tax on a worst case basis that could be accelerated into a current taxes payable based on the revised NOPA would be approximately $88 million.  However, we would be entitled to a cash tax benefit associated with the additional tax depreciation that would result from increasing the depreciable cost for tax purposes in the assets acquired.  This net current tax liability would accrue interest, which is estimated to be approximately $21 million before income tax effect.In certain circumstances, the IRS may assess penalties when challenging our tax positions.  If we were unsuccessful in defending against these penalties, it may have a material impact on our results of operations.  No penalties have been assessed by the IRS in connection with the like-kind exchange transaction.An effective system of internal control may not be maintained, leading to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management to make an assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal controls.  Our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of these controls.  During their assessment of these controls, management or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify areas of weakness in control design or effectiveness, which may lead to the conclusion that a material weakness in internal control exists.  Any control deficiencies we identify in the future could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis, which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports or have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business or access sources of liquidity. 65ENVIRONMENTAL RISKSFederal and state laws concerning greenhouse gas regulations and air emissions may materially increase our generation and production costs and could render some of our generating units uneconomical to operate and maintain.We own and operate regulated and non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants in South Dakota, Wyoming and Colorado.  Recent developments under federal and state laws and regulations governing air emissions from fossil-fuel generating plants will likely result in more stringent emission limitations, which could have a material impact on our costs of operations.  Various pending or final state and EPA regulations that will impact our facilities are also discussed in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption “Environmental Matters.”On February 16, 2012, the EPA published MATS in the Federal Register with an effective date of April 16, 2012.  Affected units had a compliance deadline of April 16, 2015, with a pathway defined to apply for a one year extension due to certain circumstances.  We applied for and received a one year extension for mercury only, with the remaining aspects of the MATS rule remaining in effect.  All our impacted plants (Neil Simpson II, Wygen I, Wygen II, Wygen III and the Wyodak Plant) are in compliance with the applicable rule provisions.The GHG Tailoring Rule, implementing regulations of GHG for permitting purposes, became effective in June 2010.  This rule will impact us in the event of a major modification at an existing facility or in the event of a new major source as defined by EPA regulations.  Upon renewal of operating permits for existing facilities, monitoring and reporting requirements will be implemented.  New projects or major modifications to existing projects will result in a Best Available Control Technology review that could impose more stringent emissions control practices and technologies.  The EPA’s GHG New Source Performance Standard for new steam electric generating units was published October 23, 2015.  That rule effectively prohibits new coal fired units until carbon capture and sequestration becomes technically and economically feasible.On October 23, 2015, the EPA finalized the CPP to cut carbon emissions from existing electric generating units.  The design of the CPP is to decrease existing coal-fired generation, increase the utilization of existing gas generation, increase renewable energy and demand side management.  This rule may have a significant impact on our coal and natural gas generating fleet.  The rule, which does not propose to regulate individual emission sources, calls for each state to develop plans to meet the EPA-assigned statewide average emission rate target for that state by 2030.  The rule also allows states to formulate a regional approach whereby they would join with other states and be assigned a new single target for the group.  On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court entered an order staying the CPP. The stay of the CPP will remain in place until the U.S. Supreme Court either denies a petition for certiorari following the U.S. Court of Appeals’ decision on the substantive challenges to the CPP, if one is submitted, or until the U.S. Supreme Court enters judgment following grant of a petition for certiorari. The effect of the order is to delay the CPP’s compliance deadlines until challenges to the CPP have been fully litigated and the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled. We do not expect a final judicial decision on challenges to the CPP earlier than mid-2017.  In 2015, we met with state air programs and public utility commissions on several occasions.  We will continue to work closely with state regulatory staff as these plans develop.Due to uncertainty as to the final outcome of federal climate change legislation, legal challenges, state clean power plan developments or regulatory changes under the Clean Air Act, we cannot definitively estimate the effect of GHG legislation or regulation on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.  The impact of GHG legislation or regulation on our company will depend upon many factors, including but not limited to, the timing of implementation, state clean power plan requirements, the GHG sources that are regulated, the overall GHG emissions cap level and the availability of technologies to control or reduce GHG emissions.  If an allowance or credit trading structure is implemented, the impact will depend on the allocation of emission allowances to specific sources, the costs of those allowances or credits and the effect of carbon regulation on natural gas and coal prices.New or more stringent regulations or other energy efficiency requirements could require us to incur significant additional costs relating to, among other things, the installation of additional emission control equipment, the acceleration of capital expenditures, the purchase of additional emissions allowances or offsets, the acquisition or development of additional energy supply from renewable resources, the closure or reduction of load of coal generating facilities and potential increased load of our combined cycle natural gas fired units.  To the extent our regulated fossil-fuel generating plants are included in rate base we will attempt to recover costs associated with complying with emission standards or other requirements.  We will also attempt to recover the emission compliance costs of our non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants from utility and other purchasers of the power generated by those non-regulated power plants.  Any unrecovered costs could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, future changes in environmental regulations governing air emissions could render some of our power generating units more expensive or uneconomical to operate and maintain. 66The failure to achieve or maintain compliance with existing or future governmental laws, regulations or requirements could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.  Additionally, the potentially high cost of complying with such requirements or addressing environmental liabilities could also adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.Our business is subject to extensive energy, environmental and other laws and regulations of federal, state, tribal and local authorities.  We generally must obtain and comply with a variety of regulations, licenses, permits and other approvals in order to operate, which can require significant capital expenditure and operating costs.  If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to civil or criminal liability and the imposition of penalties, liens or fines, claims for property damage or personal injury, or environmental clean-up costs.  In addition, existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities, which could require additional unexpected expenditures or cause us to reevaluate the feasibility of continued operations at certain sites and have a detrimental effect on our business.In connection with certain acquisitions, we assumed liabilities associated with the environmental condition of certain properties, regardless of when such liabilities arose, whether known or unknown, and in some cases agreed to indemnify the former owners of those properties for environmental liabilities.  Future steps to bring our facilities into compliance or to address contamination from legacy operations, if necessary, could be expensive and could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.  We expect our environmental compliance expenditures to be substantial in the future due to the continuing trends toward stricter standards, greater regulation, more extensive permitting requirements and an increase in the number of assets we operate.The characteristics of coal may make it difficult for coal users to comply with various environmental standards related to coal combustion or utilization and the use of alternative energy sources for power generation as mandated by states could reduce coal consumption.  As a result, coal users may switch to other fuels, which would affect the volume of our sales and the price of our products.Coal contains impurities, including but not limited to sulfur, mercury, chlorine, carbon and other elements or compounds, many of which are released into the air when coal is burned.  More stringent environmental regulations of emissions from coal-fueled power plants could increase the costs of using coal, thereby reducing demand for coal as a fuel source and the volume and price of our coal sales.  Renewable energy requirements and changes to regulations could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative in the planning and building of power plants in the future.Future regulations may require further reductions in emissions of mercury, hazardous pollutants, SO2, NOx, volatile organic compounds, particulate matter, and GHG.  These requirements could require the installation of costly emission control technology or the implementation of other measures.  Reductions in mercury emissions required by EPA’s MATS rule described earlier, will likely require some power plants to install new equipment, at substantial cost, or discourage the use of certain coals containing higher levels of mercury.  The EPA’s October 23, 2015 CPP described earlier, is designed to cut carbon emissions from existing electric generating units.  The basis of the CPP is to decrease existing coal-fired generation, increase the utilization of existing gas fired combined cycle generation, increase renewable energy and demand side management.  This rule could have a significant impact on our coal and natural gas generating fleet.  The rule calls for states to develop plans to meet their assigned emission rate targets by 2030.  The rule also allows states to formulate a regional approach whereby they would join with other states and be assigned a new single target for the group.  On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court entered an order staying the CPP. The stay of the CPP will remain in place until the U.S. Supreme Court either denies a petition for certiorari following the U.S. Court of Appeals’ decision on the substantive challenges to the CPP, if one is submitted, or until the U.S. Supreme Court enters judgment following grant of a petition for certiorari. The effect of the order is to delay the CPP’s compliance deadlines until challenges to the CPP have been fully litigated and the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled. We do not expect a final judicial decision on challenges to the CPP earlier than mid-2017.  At this time we cannot predict the impact on operations.Coal competes with other energy sources, such as natural gas, wind, solar and hydropower.  The CPP regulation is expected to have an adverse effect on coal as a domestic energy source, and could have a significant impact on our coal mining operations.Existing or proposed legislation focusing on emissions enacted by the United States or individual states could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative for our customers and could impose a tax or fee on the producer of the coal.  If our customers decrease the volume of coal they purchase from us or switch to alternative fuels as a result of existing or future environmental regulations aimed at reducing emissions, our operations and financial results could be adversely impacted. 67RISKS RELATED TO THE SOURCEGAS ACQUISITIONThe Transaction may not achieve its intended results, including anticipated operating efficiencies and cost savings, and integration efforts may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, which may negatively affect the market price of our notes or common stock.While management currently anticipates that the Transaction will be accretive to our earnings per share beginning in 2017, this expectation is based on preliminary estimates which may materially change.  In addition, although we expect that the Transaction will result in various other benefits, including a significant amount of operating efficiencies and other financial and operational benefits, there can be no assurance regarding when or the extent to which we will be able to realize these operating efficiencies or other benefits.  Achieving the anticipated benefits is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the businesses acquired can be operated in the manner we intend.  Events outside of our control, including but not limited to regulatory changes or developments, could also adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the Transaction.  Thus the integration of SourceGas’s business may be unpredictable, subject to delays or changed circumstances, and we can give no assurance that the acquired businesses will perform in accordance with our expectations or that our expectations with respect to integration or operating efficiencies as a result of the Transaction will materialize.  In addition, our anticipated transaction costs and costs to achieve the integration of SourceGas may differ significantly from our current estimates.  The integration may place an additional burden on our management and internal resources, and the diversion of management’s attention during the integration process could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and expected operating results.  Any of these factors could cause a decrease in the price of our notes or common stock.The Transaction may subject us to other risks.The Transaction subjects us to a number of additional risks, including the following:•Uncertainty about the effect of the Transaction on employees, customers, vendors and others may have an adverse effect on us.  Although we intend to take steps designed to reduce any adverse effects, these uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Transaction is completed, and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause vendors and others that deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships.•We cannot be assured that our credit ratings will not be lowered as a result of the Transaction or for any other reason.  Any reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our access to capital, our cost of capital and our other operating costs, and our ability to refinance or repay our existing debt and complete new financings.The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations or the trading price of our notes or common stock.We incurred and assumed significant debt to provide permanent financing for the Transaction and, as a result, we are subject to market risks including market demand for debt offerings, interest rate volatility, and adverse impacts on our credit ratings.We funded the cash consideration and out-of-pocket expenses payable in connection with the Transaction using the net proceeds (after deducting discounts and fees on the notes) from our $546 million debt offering on January 13, 2016, together with the approximately $535.7 million of net proceeds (after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions but before offering expenses) from our offerings of common stock and equity units in November 2015, other cash on hand and draws under our revolving credit facility.  We assumed approximately $760 million of SourceGas’s debt at the closing of the Transaction, reducing the cash consideration payable at closing.Among other risks, the issuance of the debt may:•make it more difficult for us to repay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions;•limit our flexibility to pursue other strategic opportunities or react to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and, consequently, place us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors with less debt; 68•require an increased portion of our cash flows from operations to be used for debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments and other general corporate purposes;•result in a downgrade in the credit rating of our indebtedness, which could limit our ability to borrow additional funds or increase the interest rates applicable to our indebtedness;•result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in market interest rates for both long‑term debt as well as short‑term commercial paper, bank loans or borrowings under our line of credit at variable rates;•reduce the amount of credit available to support hedging activities; and•require that additional terms, conditions or covenants be placed on us.We will record goodwill that could become impaired and adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations.We expect to record a significant amount of goodwill associated with the SourceGas Transaction.  If we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect operations in any of our businesses, we may be forced to record a non-cash impairment charge, which would reduce our reported assets, net income and shareholders’ equity.  Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.  If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill in the period the determination is made.  The testing of goodwill for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions.  These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including:  future business operating performance, changes in economic conditions and interest rates, regulatory, industry or market conditions, changes in business operations, changes in competition or changes in technologies.  Any changes in key assumptions, or actual performance compared with key assumptions, about our business and its future prospects could affect the fair value of one or more business segments, which may result in an impairment charge.We incurred significant transaction and acquisition‑related costs in connection with the Transaction.We have incurred significant costs associated with the Transaction and we expect to incur significantly more costs as we combine the operations of the two companies, including costs to achieve targeted cost‑savings. The substantial majority of the expenses resulting from the Transaction are composed of transaction costs, systems consolidation costs, and business integration and employment‑related costs.  We also incurred transaction fees and costs related to formulating integration plans.  Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies’ businesses.  Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow us to offset incremental transaction and acquisition‑related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.Failure to complete future refinancing for our assumed SourceGas debt on favorable terms could have a negative affect on our stock price, and could affect our future business and financial results.In connection with the Transaction, we are assuming approximately $760 million of SourceGas’s indebtedness, which had terms that are less favorable than we believe we can generally obtain in the debt markets.  If we are able to refinance the debt, we will incur transaction costs related to the refinancing, and if we are not able to refinance the debt on more favorable terms, it may negatively affect our stock price"
7,BKH,BLACK HILLS CORP,2015-02-25,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSThe nature of our business subjects us to a number of uncertainties and risks.  The following risk factors and other risk factors that we discuss in our periodic reports filed with the SEC should be considered for a better understanding of our Company.  These important factors and other matters discussed herein could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ materially.OPERATING RISKSOur current or future development, expansion and acquisition activities may not be successful, which could impair our ability to execute our growth strategy.Execution of our future growth plan is dependent on successful ongoing and future development, expansion and acquisition activities.  We can provide no assurance that we will be able to complete development projects or acquisitions we undertake or continue to develop attractive opportunities for growth.  Factors that could cause our development, expansion and acquisition activities to be unsuccessful include:•Our inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals or the imposition of adverse conditions upon the approval of any acquisition;•Our inability to secure adequate utility rates through regulatory proceedings;•Our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all;•The possibility that one or more credit rating agencies would downgrade our issuer credit rating to below investment grade, thus increasing our cost of doing business;•Our inability to successfully integrate any businesses we acquire;•Our inability to attract and retain management or other key personnel;•Our inability to negotiate acceptable acquisition, construction, fuel supply, power sales or other material agreements;•The trend of utilities building their own generation or looking for developers to develop and build projects for sale to utilities under turnkey arrangements;•Reduced growth in the demand for utility services in the markets we serve;•Changes in federal, state, local or tribal laws and regulations, particularly those which would make it more difficult or costly to fully develop our coal reserves, our oil and gas reserves and our generation capacity;•Fuel prices or fuel supply constraints;•Pipeline capacity and transmission constraints; •Competition within our industry and with producers of competing energy sources; and•Changes in tax rates and policies. 53Our financial performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities.  If the risks involved in our operations are not appropriately managed or mitigated, our operations may not be successful and this could adversely affect our results of operations.Operating electric generating facilities, oil and gas properties, the coal mine and electric and natural gas distribution systems involves risks, including:•Operational limitations imposed by environmental and other regulatory requirements;•Interruptions to supply of fuel and other commodities used in generation and distribution.  The Utilities Group purchases fuel from a number of suppliers.  Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the delivery of fuel due to various factors, including but not limited to, transportation delays, labor relations, weather and environmental regulations, which could limit the Utilities Group’s ability to operate their facilities;•Breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, including those operated by PacifiCorp at the Wyodak plant;•Inability to recruit and retain skilled technical labor;•Disrupted transmission and distribution.  We depend on transmission and distribution facilities, including those operated by unaffiliated parties, to deliver the electricity and gas that we sell to our retail and wholesale customers.  If transmission is interrupted, our ability to sell or deliver product and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered;•Operating hazards such as leaks, mechanical problems and accidents, including explosions, affecting our natural gas distribution system which could impact public safety, reliability and customer confidence;•Electricity is dangerous for employees and the general public should they come in contact with power lines or electrical equipment.  Natural conditions and other disasters such as wind, lightning and winter storms can cause wildfires, pole failures and associated property damage and outages.  For example, as described in more detail under “Legal Proceedings,” a fire investigator concluded that a forest and grassland fire in the western Black Hills of Wyoming and South Dakota in 2012 was caused by the failure of a transmission structure owned, operated and maintained by Black Hills Power, and claims have been made against us related to the fire;•Disruption in the functioning of our information technology and network infrastructure which are vulnerable to disability, failures and unauthorized access.  If our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions; and•Labor relations.  Approximately 30% of our employees are represented by a total of six collective bargaining agreements.Construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve significant risks which could reduce profitability.The construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve many risks, including:•The inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals along with the cost of complying with or satisfying conditions imposed upon such approvals;•Contractual restrictions upon the timing of scheduled outages;•The cost of supplying or securing replacement power during scheduled and unscheduled outages;•The unavailability or increased cost of equipment;•The cost of recruiting and retaining or the unavailability of skilled labor;•Supply interruptions, work stoppages and labor disputes; 54•Increased capital and operating costs to comply with increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations;•Opposition by members of public or special-interest groups;•Weather interferences;•Availability and cost of fuel supplies;•Unexpected engineering, environmental and geological problems; and•Unanticipated cost overruns.The ongoing operation of our facilities involves many of the risks described above, in addition to risks relating to the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency.  New plants may employ recently developed and technologically complex equipment, including newer environmental emission control technology.  Any of these risks could cause us to operate below expected capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues, increase expenses or cause us to incur higher operating and maintenance costs and penalties.  While we maintain insurance, obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance and our rights under warranties or performance guarantees may not be timely or adequate to cover lost revenues, increased expenses, liability or liquidated damage payments.Operating results can be adversely affected by variations from normal weather conditions.Our utility businesses are seasonal businesses and weather patterns can have a material impact on our operating performance.  Demand for electricity is typically greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating.  Because natural gas is primarily used for residential and commercial heating, the demand for this product depends heavily upon winter weather patterns throughout our service territory and a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating seasons.  Accordingly, our utility operations have historically generated lower revenues and income when weather conditions are cooler than normal in the summer and warmer than normal in the winter.  Unusually mild summers and winters therefore could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our businesses are located in areas that could be subject to seasonal natural disasters such as severe snow and ice storms, flooding and wildfires.  These factors could result in interruption of our business, damage to our property such as power lines and substations and repair and clean-up costs associated with these storms.  We may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring transmission and distribution property following these natural disasters through a change in our regulated rates thereby resulting in a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our coal mining operations are subject to operating risks that are beyond our control which could affect our profitability and production levels.  Our surface mining operations could be disrupted or materially affected due to adverse weather or natural disasters such as heavy snow, strong winds, rain or flooding.  Additionally, weather patterns can also affect electricity demand.  Extreme temperatures, both hot and cold, cause increased power usage, and therefore, increased generating requirements and the use of coal.  Conversely, mild temperatures could result in lower electrical demand.Weather conditions can also limit or temporarily halt our drilling, completion and producing activities and other crude oil and natural gas operations.  Primarily in the winter and spring, our operations can be curtailed because of cold, snow and wet conditions.  Severe weather could further curtail these operations, including drilling, and completion of new wells or production from existing wells.  In addition, weather conditions and other events could temporarily impair our ability to transport our crude oil and natural gas production. 55Prices for some of our products and services as well as a portion of our operating costs are volatile and may cause our revenues and expenses to fluctuate significantly.A portion of our net income is attributable to sales of contract and off-system wholesale electricity and natural gas.  Energy prices are influenced by many factors outside our control, including, among other things, fuel prices, transmission constraints, supply and demand, weather, general economic conditions, and the rules, regulations and actions of system operators in those markets.  Moreover, unlike most other commodities, electricity cannot be stored and therefore must be produced concurrently with its use.  As a result, wholesale power markets may be subject to significant, unpredictable price fluctuations over relatively short periods of time.The success of our crude oil and natural gas operations is affected by the prevailing market prices of crude oil and natural gas.  Crude oil and natural gas prices and markets historically have been, and are likely to continue to be, unpredictable.  A decrease in crude oil or natural gas prices would not only reduce revenues and profits, but would also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable and may result in charges to earnings for impairment of the net capitalized cost of these assets.  Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for crude oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control.The proliferation of domestic crude oil and natural gas shale plays in recent years has provided the market with an abundant new supply of crude oil and natural gas.  The increase in domestic natural gas supply has driven prices down in recent years.  The ratio of crude oil to natural gas prices remains at high levels, far in excess of the six to one heating value equivalent ratio.  There is also risk that the increased domestic crude oil resources could drive crude oil prices lower.Our mining operation requires reliable supplies of replacement parts, explosives, fuel, tires and steel-related products.  If the cost of these increase significantly, or if sources of supplies and mining equipment become unavailable to meet our replacement demands, our productivity and profitability could be lower than our current expectations.  In recent years, industry-wide demand growth exceeded supply growth for certain surface mining equipment and off-the-road tires.  As a result, lead times for procuring some items generally increased to several months and prices for these items increased significantly.Our operations rely on storage and transportation assets owned by third parties to satisfy our obligations.  If storage capacity is inadequate or transportation is disrupted, our ability to satisfy our obligations may be hindered.Our Utilities Group and Power Generation segment rely on pipeline companies and other owners of gas storage facilities to deliver natural gas to ratepayers, to supply our natural gas-fired power plants and to hedge commodity costs.  If storage capacity is inadequate or transportation is disrupted, our ability to satisfy our obligations may be hindered.  As a result, we may be responsible for damages incurred by our counterparties, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at then-current market rates, or for penalties imposed by state regulatory authorities.Threats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt our businesses, or the businesses of third parties, may impact our operations in unpredictable ways and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.We are subject to the potentially adverse operating and financial effects of terrorist acts and threats and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups.  Our generation, transmission and distribution facilities, fuel storage facilities, information technology systems and other infrastructure facilities and systems and physical assets, could be direct targets of, or indirectly affected by, such activities.  Terrorist acts or other similar events could harm our businesses by limiting their ability to generate, purchase or transmit power and by delaying their development and construction of new generating facilities and capital improvements to existing facilities.  These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair and insure our assets and could adversely affect our operations by contributing to disruption of supplies and markets for natural gas, oil and other fuels.  They could also impair our ability to raise capital by contributing to financial instability and lower economic activity.The implementation of security guidelines and measures and maintenance of insurance, to the extent available, addressing such activities could increase costs.  These types of events could materially adversely affect our financial results.  In addition, these types of events could require significant management attention and resources and could adversely affect our reputation among customers and the public. 56A disruption of the regional electric transmission grid, natural gas pipeline infrastructure or other fuel sources, could negatively impact our business.  Because generation, transmission systems and natural gas pipelines are part of an interconnected system, we face the risk of possible loss of business due to a disruption caused by the impact of an event on the interconnected system (such as severe weather or a generator or transmission facility outage, pipeline rupture, or a sudden significant increase or decrease in wind generation) within our system or within a neighboring system.  Any such disruption could have a material impact on our financial results.A cyber attack may disrupt our operations, or lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information and create a potential liability.We operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continuous use and operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure.  In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we collect and retain sensitive information including personal information about our customers and employees.  Cyber attacks targeting our electronic control systems used at our generating facilities and for electric and gas distribution systems, could result in a full or partial disruption of our electric and/or gas operations.  Cyber attacks targeting other key information technology systems could further add to a full or partial disruption to our operations. Any disruption of these operations could result in a loss of service to customers and a significant decrease in revenues, as well as significant expense to repair system damage and remedy security breaches.  Any theft, loss and/or fraudulent use of customer, shareowner, employee or proprietary data as a result of a cyber attack could subject us to significant litigation, liability and costs, as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators, among others.We have instituted security measures and safeguards to protect our operational systems and information technology assets.  FERC, through the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, requires certain safeguards be implemented to deter cyber attacks.  The security measures and safeguards we have implemented may not always be effective due to the evolving nature and sophistication of cyber attacks. Despite our implementation of security measures and safeguards, all of our information technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access, including cyber attacks.  If our information technology systems were to fail or be breached by a cyber attack or a computer virus and be unable to recover in a timely way, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions and sensitive confidential and other data could be compromised which could have a material adverse effect not only on our financial results, but on our public reputation as well.Increased risks of regulatory penalties could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.Business activities in the energy sector are heavily regulated, primarily by agencies of the federal government.  Agencies that historically sought voluntary compliance, or issued non-monetary sanctions, now employ mandatory civil penalty structures for regulatory violations.  The FERC, CFTC, EPA, OSHA, SEC and MSHA may impose significant civil and criminal penalties to enforce compliance requirements relative to our business.  In addition, FERC delegated certain aspects of authority for enforcement of electric system reliability standards to the NERC, with similar penalty authority for violations.  If a serious regulatory violation occurred and penalties were imposed by FERC or another federal agency, this action could have a material adverse effect on our operations and/or our financial results.Certain Federal laws, including the Migratory Bird Act and the Endangered Species Act, provide special protection to certain designated species.  These laws and any state equivalents provide for significant civil and criminal penalties for non-permitted activities that result in harm to or harassment of certain protected animals, including damage to their habitats.  If such species are located in an area in which we conduct operations, or if additional species in those areas become subject to protection, our operations and development projects, particularly transmission, generation, wind, pipeline or drilling projects, could be restricted or delayed, or we could be required to implement expensive mitigation measures. 57Our energy production, transmission and distribution activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other catastrophic events.  These events could disrupt or impair our operations, create additional costs and cause substantial loss to us.Inherent in our natural gas and electricity transmission and distribution activities, as well as our production, transportation and storage of crude oil and natural gas and our coal mining operations, are a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, blow-outs, fires, releases of hazardous materials, explosions and mechanical problems that could cause substantial adverse financial impacts.  These events could result in injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property or natural resources (including public parks), environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us.  In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses.  The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.  Particularly for our transmission and distribution lines located near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering areas, the damages resulting from any such events could be significant.UtilitiesRegulatory commissions may refuse to approve some or all of the utility rate increases we have requested or may request in the future, or may determine that amounts passed through to customers were not prudently incurred and therefore are not recoverable, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.Our regulated electric and gas utility operations are subject to cost-of-service regulation and earnings oversight from federal and state utility commissions.  This regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of desired earnings levels.  Our retail electric and gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding.  The rates that we are allowed to charge may or may not match our related costs and allowed return on invested capital at any given time.  While rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that the state public utility commissions will judge all of our costs, including our direct and allocated borrowing and debt service costs, to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that produce a full recovery of our costs and the return on invested capital allowed by the applicable state public utility commission.To some degree, each of our gas and electric utilities are permitted to recover certain costs (such as increased fuel and purchased power costs) without having to file a rate case.  To the extent we are able to pass through such costs to our customers and a state public utility commission subsequently determines that such costs should not have been paid by the customers; we may be required to refund such costs.  Any such costs not recovered through rates, or any such refund, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flow.If regulatory commissions refuse to approve the implementation of a cost of service gas program to serve our natural gas utilities and the fuel needs of our electric utilities, it could adversely affect future operations or require us to make changes to our business strategy.We are evaluating the implementation of a program supporting our natural gas and electric utilities that can provide longer-term price stability for our regulated customers by enhancing our current utility gas supply portfolio, through the addition of utility or affiliate owned natural gas production and reserves.  In addition to providing our customers the benefits associated with more predictable long-term commodity prices, it also provides additional opportunities for increased earnings.  We will require regulatory approval from our state commissions to implement this program.  If regulatory commissions refuse to approve the program, we may have to reconsider our long-term strategy, including the potential for vertical integration of our oil and gas operations in support of this program. 58If market or other conditions adversely affect operations or require us to make changes to our business strategy in any of our utility businesses, we may be forced to record a non-cash goodwill impairment charge.  Any significant impairment of our goodwill related to these utilities would cause a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net income and shareholders’ equity.We had approximately $353 million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2014.  A substantial portion of the goodwill is related to the Aquila Transaction.  If we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect operations in any of our businesses, we may be forced to record a non-cash impairment charge, which would reduce our reported assets, net income and shareholders’ equity.  Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.  If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill in the period the determination is made.  The testing of goodwill for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions.  These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including:  future business operating performance, changes in economic conditions and interest rates, regulatory, industry or market conditions, changes in business operations, changes in competition or changes in technologies.  Any changes in key assumptions, or actual performance compared with key assumptions, about our business and its future prospects could affect the fair value of one or more business segments, which may result in an impairment charge.Municipal governments may seek to limit or deny franchise privileges which could inhibit our ability to secure adequate recovery of our investment in assets subject to condemnation.Municipal governments within our utility service territories possess the power of condemnation and could establish a municipal utility within a portion of our current service territories by limiting or denying franchise privileges for our operations and exercising powers of condemnation over all or part of our utility assets within municipal boundaries.  Although condemnation is a process that is subject to constitutional protections requiring just and fair compensation, as with any judicial procedure, the outcome is uncertain.  If a municipality sought to pursue this course of action, we cannot assure that we would secure adequate recovery of our investment in assets subject to condemnation.Power GenerationOur ability to execute the purchase option for the sale of Wygen I to Cheyenne Light Fuel & Power could adversely affect our Power Generation segment.  Black Hills Wyoming has a power sales agreement with Cheyenne Light which expires in December 2022.  This power sales agreement includes an option for Cheyenne Light to purchase Black Hills Wyoming’s ownership interest in the Wygen I facility until 2019.  This purchase by Cheyenne Light, estimated to be approximately $154 million at December 31, 2014, would be subject to WPSC approval in order to obtain regulatory treatment.  The inability to obtain power sales contracts at reasonable rates to fully utilize these assets subsequent to the expiration of long-term contracts could affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.Coal MiningIf the assumptions underlying our reclamation and mine closure obligations are materially inaccurate, our costs could be significantly greater than anticipated or be incurred sooner than anticipated.Our mining consists of surface mining operations.  The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and similar state laws and regulation establish operations, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining.  We estimate our total reclamation liabilities based on permit requirements, engineering studies and our engineering expertise related to these requirements.  The estimate of ultimate reclamation liability is reviewed periodically by our management and engineers and by government regulators.  The estimated liability can change significantly if actual costs vary from our original assumptions or if government regulations change significantly.  GAAP requires that asset retirement obligations be recorded as a liability based on fair value, which reflects the present value of the estimated future cash flows.  In estimating future cash flows, we consider the estimated current cost of reclamation and apply inflation rates.  The resulting estimated reclamation obligations could change significantly if actual amounts or the timing of these expenses change significantly from our assumptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 59Estimates of the quality and quantity of our coal reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in three dimensional structural modeling.  Significant inaccuracies in interpretation or modeling could materially affect the estimated quantity and quality of our reserve which could adversely affect our results of operations.There are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of coal reserves.  The process of coal volume estimation requires interpretations of drill hole log data and subsequent computer modeling of the intersected deposit.  Significant inaccuracies in interpretation or modeling could materially affect the quantity and quality of our reserve estimates.  The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of engineering and geological interpretation, conditions encountered during actual reserve recovery and undetected deposit anomalies.  Variance from the assumptions used and drill hole modeling density could result in additions or deletions from our volume estimates.  In addition, future environmental, economic or geologic changes may occur or become known that require reserve revisions either upward or downward from prior reserve estimates.Oil and GasEstimates of the quantity and value of our proved oil and gas reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves.  Significant inaccuracies in interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves which could adversely affect our results of operations.There are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and their associated value.  The process of estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves requires interpretation of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors.  Significant inaccuracies in interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.  The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretations and judgment and the assumptions used regarding quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves, future capital expenditures and prices for crude oil and natural gas.  Actual prices, production, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves may vary from those assumed in our estimates.  These variances may be significant.  Any significant variance from the assumptions used could cause the actual quantity of our reserves and future net cash flow to be materially different from our estimates.  In addition, results of drilling, testing and production, changes in future capital expenditures and fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices after the date of the estimate may result in substantial upward or downward revisions.The potential adoption of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in restrictions which could increase costs and cause delays to the completion of certain oil and gas wells and potentially preclude the economic drilling and completion of wells in certain reservoirs.Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry used extensively for decades to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations.  We routinely apply hydraulic fracturing techniques on our crude oil and natural gas properties.  Hydraulic fracturing involves using mostly water, sand and a small amount of certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to enhance flow of hydrocarbons into the well-bore.  The process is typically regulated by state crude oil and natural gas commissions; however, the EPA does assert federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities when diesel comprises part of the fracturing fluid.  In addition several agencies of the federal government including the EPA and the BLM are conducting studies of the fracturing stimulation process which may result in additional regulations.  In May 2013, the U.S. Department of the Interior re-proposed rules regulating the use of hydraulic fracturing on Federal and Indian Lands, with final action expected in 2015.  In addition, legislation has been introduced before Congress, called the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act, to provide the federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process.Certain states have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether.  In the event federal, state, local or municipal legal restrictions on the hydraulic fracturing are adopted in areas where we are conducting or in the future plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply with such regulations that may be significant, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from utilizing fracture stimulation and effectively preclude the drilling of wells. 60Exploratory and development drilling are speculative activities that may not result in commercially productive reserves.  Lack of drilling success could result in uneconomical investments and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Drilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered.  There can be no assurance that new wells drilled by us or in which we have an interest will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment.  Drilling for oil and gas may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells, but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs.  The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain.  Our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including economic conditions, mechanical problems, pressure or irregularities in formations, title problems, weather conditions, compliance with governmental rules and regulations and shortages in or delays in the delivery of equipment and services.  Such equipment shortages and delays are caused by the high demand for rigs and other needed equipment by a large number of companies in active drilling basins.  High activity in some basins may cause shortages of rigs and equipment in other basins.  Our future drilling activities may not be successful.  Lack of drilling success could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We could incur additional and substantial write-downs of the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties, which would cause a decrease in our assets and stockholders' equity and could adversely impact our results of operations.We review the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties under the full cost accounting rules of the SEC on a quarterly basis.  This quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test.  Under the ceiling test, capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects.  In calculating future net revenues, SEC-defined commodity prices and recent costs are utilized.  Such prices and costs are utilized except when different prices and costs are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts.  Two primary factors in the ceiling test are natural gas and crude oil reserve quantities and SEC-defined crude oil and gas prices, both of which impact the present value of estimated future net revenues.  Revisions to estimates of natural gas and crude oil reserves, or an increase or decrease in prices, can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues.  The amount by which net book value, less deferred income tax, exceeds the tax adjusted net present value of reserves is written off as an expense.We recorded a non-cash impairment charge in the second quarter of 2012 due to the full cost ceiling limitations. Using our year-end reserve information and holding all other variables constant, a price sensitivity analysis indicates it is probable a ceiling impairment charge will occur in 2015 if crude oil and natural gas prices remain at or near the low levels experienced in late 2014 and early 2015.  See Note 12 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.FINANCING RISKSOur credit ratings could be lowered below investment grade in the future.  If this were to occur, it could impact our access to capital, our cost of capital and our other operating costs.Our issuer credit rating is Baa1 (Stable outlook) by Moody’s; BBB (Stable outlook) by S&P; and BBB+ (Stable outlook) by Fitch.  Reduction of our credit ratings could impair our ability to refinance or repay our existing debt and to complete new financings on reasonable terms, or at all.  A credit rating downgrade, particularly to a sub-investment grade, could also result in counterparties requiring us to post additional collateral under existing or new contracts or trades.  In addition, a ratings downgrade would increase our interest expense under some of our existing debt obligations, including borrowings under our credit facilities.Derivatives regulations included in current financial reform legislation could impede our ability to manage business and financial risks by restricting our use of derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates.In July 2010, Dodd-Frank was passed by Congress and signed into law.  Dodd-Frank contains significant derivatives regulations, including a requirement that certain transactions be cleared resulting in a requirement to post cash collateral (commonly referred to as “margin”) for such transactions.  Dodd-Frank provides for a potential exception from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end-users such as utilities and it includes a number of defined terms that will be used in determining how this exception applies to particular derivative transactions and the parties to those transactions. 61We use crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments for our hedging activities for our oil and gas production activities and our gas utility operations.  We also use interest rate derivative instruments to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations.  As a result of Dodd-Frank regulations promulgated by the CFTC, we may be required to post collateral to clearing entities for certain swap transactions we enter into.  In addition, many of the transactions which were previously classified as swaps have been converted to exchange-traded futures contracts, which are subject to futures margin posting requirements.  Such a requirement could have a significant impact on our business by reducing our ability to execute derivative transactions to reduce commodity price and interest rate uncertainty and to protect cash flows.  Requirements to post collateral may cause significant liquidity issues by reducing our ability to use cash for investment or other corporate purposes, or may require us to increase our level of debt.  In addition, a requirement for our counterparties to post collateral could result in additional costs being passed on to us, thereby decreasing our profitability.Our hedging activities that are designed to protect against commodity price and financial market risks may cause fluctuations in reported financial results due to accounting requirements associated with such activities.We use various financial contracts and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps to manage commodity price and financial market risks.  The timing of the recognition of gains or losses on these economic hedges in accordance with GAAP does not always match up with the gains or losses on the commodities or assets being hedged.  The difference in accounting can result in volatility in reported results, even though the expected profit margin may be essentially unchanged from the dates the transactions were consummated.Our use of derivative financial instruments could result in material financial losses.From time to time, we have sought to limit a portion of the potential adverse effects resulting from changes in commodity prices and interest rates by using derivative financial instruments and other hedging mechanisms.  To the extent that we hedge our commodity price and interest rate exposures, we forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in our favor.  In addition, even though they are closely monitored by management, our hedging activities can result in losses.  Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the hedge arrangement, the hedge is economically imperfect, commodity prices or interest rates move unfavorably related to our physical or financial positions, or hedging policies and procedures are not followed.Market performance or changes in other assumptions could require us to make significant unplanned contributions to our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans.  Increasing costs associated with our defined benefit retirement plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.We have two defined benefit pension plans and three non-pension postretirement plans that cover certain eligible employees.  Assumptions related to future costs, return on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on our funding requirements and the expense recognized related to these plans.  These estimates and assumptions may change based on actual return on plan assets, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations.We have a holding company corporate structure with multiple subsidiaries.  Corporate dividends and debt payments are dependent upon cash distributions to the holding company from the subsidiaries.  The subsidiaries may not be allowed or may be unable to make dividend payments or loan funds to the holding company, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations or pay dividends to our shareholders.We are a holding company.  Our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets.  Our operating cash flow and ability to service our indebtedness depend on the operating cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends or advances.  Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available for that purpose, whether by dividends or otherwise.  In addition, each subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to us depends on any applicable contractual or regulatory restrictions that may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of cash, working capital or debt service funds.We expect to continue our policy of paying regular cash dividends.  However, there is no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on our future earnings, capital requirements and financial conditions and are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.  Our operating subsidiaries have certain restrictions on their ability to transfer funds in the form of dividends or loans to us.  See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these restrictions and their impact on our liquidity. 62We may be unable to obtain the financing needed to refinance debt, fund planned capital expenditures or otherwise execute our operating strategy.  Lack of credit at reasonable rates would have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.Our ability to execute our operating strategy is highly dependent upon our access to capital.  Historically, we have addressed our liquidity needs (including funds required to make scheduled principal and interest payments, refinance debt and fund working capital and planned capital expenditures) with operating cash flow, borrowings under credit facilities, proceeds of debt and equity offerings and proceeds from asset sales.  Our ability to access the capital markets and the costs and terms of available financing depend on many factors, including changes in our credit ratings, changes in the federal or state regulatory environment affecting energy companies, volatility in commodity or electricity prices and general economic and market conditions.In addition, because we are a holding company and our utility assets are owned by our subsidiaries, if we are unable to adequately access the credit markets, we could be required to take additional measures designed to ensure that our utility subsidiaries are adequately capitalized to provide safe and reliable service.  Possible additional measures would be evaluated in the context of then-prevailing market conditions, prudent financial management and any applicable regulatory requirements.National and regional economic conditions may cause increased counterparty credit risk, late payments and uncollectible accounts, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.A future recession may lead to an increase in late payments from retail, commercial and industrial utility customers, as well as our non-utility customers.  If late payments and uncollectible accounts increase, earnings and cash flows from our continuing operations may be reduced.Our ability to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers.  Our insurance coverage may not provide protection against all significant losses.Our ability to obtain insurance, as well as the cost of such insurance, could be affected by developments affecting insurance businesses, international, national, state or local events, as well as the financial condition of insurers.  Insurance coverage may not continue to be available at all, or at rates or on terms similar to those presently available to us.  A loss for which we are not fully insured could materially and adversely affect our financial results.  Our insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which the Company may be subject, including but not limited to environmental hazards, fire-related liability from natural events or inadequate facility maintenance, risks associated with our oil and gas exploration and production activities, distribution property losses, cyber-security risks and dangers that exist in the gathering and transportation in pipelines.Our operations are also subject to all the hazards and risks normally incident to the development, exploitation, production and transportation of, and the exploration for, oil and gas, including unusual or unexpected geologic formations, pressures, down hole fires, mechanical failures, blowouts, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, gas or well fluids, pollution and other environmental risks.  These hazards could result in substantial losses to us due to injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution and other environmental damage and suspension of operations.  We maintain insurance coverage for our operated wells and we participate in insurance coverage maintained by the operators of our wells, although there can be no assurances that such coverage will be sufficient to prevent a material adverse effect to us if any of the foregoing events occur.Increasing costs associated with our health care plans and other benefits may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.The costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees have increased substantially in recent years.  We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs related to health care plans for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise.  The increasing costs and funding requirements associated with our health care plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 63In March 2010, the President of the United States signed PPACA as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “2010 Acts”).  The 2010 Acts will have a substantial impact on health care providers, insurers, employers and individuals.  The 2010 Acts will impact employers and businesses differently depending on the size of the organization and the specific impacts on a company’s employees.  Certain provisions of the 2010 Acts are effective while other provisions of the 2010 Acts will be effective in future years.  The 2010 Acts could require, among other things, changes to our current employee benefit plans and in our administrative and accounting processes, as well as changes to the cost of our plans.  The ultimate extent and cost of these changes cannot be determined at this time and are being evaluated and updated as related regulations and interpretations of the 2010 Acts become available.Our electric and gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding.  Within our utility rates we have generally recovered the cost of providing employee benefits.  As benefit costs continue to rise, there can be no assurance that the state public utility commissions will allow recovery.We have deferred a substantial amount of income tax related to various tax planning strategies, including the deferral of a gain associated with the assets sold in the IPP Transaction.  If the Internal Revenue Service successfully challenges these tax positions, our results of operations, financial position or liquidity could be adversely affected.We have deferred a substantial amount of tax payments through various tax planning strategies including the deferral of approximately $125 million in income taxes associated with a like-kind exchange related to the IPP Transaction and the Aquila Transaction.The IRS has challenged our position with respect to the like-kind exchange.  As stated in a revised Notice of Proposed Adjustment received from the IRS in April 2013, their position is to disallow a significant portion of the gain deferred as reported on our originally filed 2008 tax return.  A 30 Day Letter along with a Revenue Agent's Report were received on July 30, 2014, indicating no change in the IRS' position.  We disagree with such a position and will pursue all available IRS and/or legal channels to challenge the proposed adjustment.  A protest was timely filed with IRS Appeals in August 2014.  In the event we are unsuccessful in our challenge, the amount of deferred income tax on a worst case basis that could be accelerated into a current taxes payable based on the revised NOPA would be approximately $88 million.  However, we would be entitled to a cash tax benefit associated with the additional tax depreciation that would result from increasing the depreciable cost for tax purposes in the assets acquired.  This net current tax liability would accrue interest, which is estimated to be approximately $19 million before income tax effect.In certain circumstances, the IRS may assess penalties when challenging our tax positions.  If we were unsuccessful in defending against these penalties, it may have a material impact on our results of operations.  No penalties have been assessed by the IRS in connection with the like-kind exchange transaction.An effective system of internal control may not be maintained, leading to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management to make an assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal controls.  Our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of these controls.  During their assessment of these controls, management or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify areas of weakness in control design or effectiveness, which may lead to the conclusion that a material weakness in internal control exists.  Any control deficiencies we identify in the future could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis, which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports or have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business or access sources of liquidity.ENVIRONMENTAL RISKSFederal and state laws concerning greenhouse gas regulations and air emissions may materially increase our generation and production costs and could render some of our generating units uneconomical to operate and maintain.We own and operate regulated and non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants in South Dakota, Wyoming and Colorado.  Recent developments under federal and state laws and regulations governing air emissions from fossil-fuel generating plants will likely result in more stringent emission limitations, which could have a material impact on our costs of operations.  Various pending or final state and EPA regulations that will impact our facilities are also discussed in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption “Environmental Matters.” 64On May 20, 2011, with amendments on December 21, 2012, the EPA’s Industrial and Commercial Boiler regulations became effective, which provide for hazardous air pollutant-related emission limits and monitoring requirements.  The compliance deadline for this rule was March 21, 2014.  Engineering evaluations were completed and confirmed the significant impact on our Neil Simpson I, Osage and Ben French facilities.  These units were permanently retired on March 21, 2014.  We have requested recovery for the remaining net book values of these plants and prudent decommissioning costs of these units.  The WPSC granted approval to our request in the Wyoming rate case approved in August 2014, and our request with the SDPUC is pending with a decision expected in March 2015.On February 16, 2012, the EPA published in the Federal Register the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from Coal and Oil Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units (MATS), with an effective date of April 16, 2012.  Affected units have a compliance deadline of April 16, 2015, with a pathway defined to apply for a one year extension due to certain circumstances.  It is expected that all of our plants will be in compliance by the initial 2015 deadline, with the primary impacts to Neil Simpson II, Wygen I, Wygen II, Wygen III and the Wyodak Plant including installation of mercury sorbent injection systems, along with additional monitoring and testing requirements.The GHG Tailoring Rule, implementing regulations of GHG for permitting purposes, became effective in June 2010.  This rule will impact us in the event of a major modification at an existing facility or in the event of a new major source as defined by EPA regulations.  Upon renewal of operating permits for existing facilities, monitoring and reporting requirements will be implemented.  New projects or major modifications to existing projects will result in a Best Available Control Technology review that could impose more stringent emissions control practices and technologies.  The EPA’s GHG New Source Performance Standard for new steam electric generating units was expected to be final by the end of 2014.  As proposed, it effectively prohibits new coal fired units until carbon capture and sequestration becomes technically and economically feasible.  It also effectively prohibits simple cycle natural gas combustion turbines from generating more than one-third of their capacity, averaged over a three year period.  The rule was not finalized in 2014 and may be delayed to June 2015 to coincide with issuance of the Clean Power Plan regulations.On June 2, 2014, the EPA proposed the Clean Power Plan to cut carbon emissions from existing electric generating units.  The design of the Clean Power Plan is to decrease existing coal-fired generation, increase the utilization of existing gas generation, increase renewable energy and demand side management.  This rule could have a significant impact on our coal and natural gas generating fleet.  The rule calls for states to develop plans to meet their assigned emission rate targets by 2030.   The rule also allows states to formulate a regional approach whereby they would join with other states and be assigned a new single target for the group.  We are currently evaluating this proposal, but cannot predict the impact on operations as this rule is expected to be final in June 2015.  State plans are expected to be due at the earliest in June 2016, with extensions possible to 2017 and 2018.Due to uncertainty as to the final outcome of federal climate change legislation, or regulatory changes under the Clean Air Act, we cannot definitively estimate the effect of GHG legislation or regulation on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.  The impact of GHG legislation or regulation on our company will depend upon many factors, including but not limited to, the timing of implementation, the GHG sources that are regulated, the overall GHG emissions cap level and the availability of technologies to control or reduce GHG emissions.  If a “cap and trade” structure is implemented, the impact will depend on the degree to which offsets are allowed, the allocation of emission allowances to specific sources and the effect of carbon regulation on natural gas and coal prices.New or more stringent regulations or other energy efficiency requirements could require us to incur significant additional costs relating to, among other things, the installation of additional emission control equipment, the acceleration of capital expenditures, the purchase of additional emissions allowances or offsets, the acquisition or development of additional energy supply from renewable resources and the closure of certain generating facilities.  To the extent our regulated fossil-fuel generating plants are included in rate base we will attempt to recover costs associated with complying with emission standards or other requirements.  We will also attempt to recover the emission compliance costs of our non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants from utility and other purchasers of the power generated by those non-regulated power plants.  Any unrecovered costs could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, future changes in environmental regulations governing air emissions could render some of our power generating units more expensive or uneconomical to operate and maintain. 65The failure to achieve or maintain compliance with existing or future governmental laws, regulations or requirements could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.  Additionally, the potentially high cost of complying with such requirements or addressing environmental liabilities could also adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.Our business is subject to extensive energy, environmental and other laws and regulations of federal, state, tribal and local authorities.  We generally must obtain and comply with a variety of regulations, licenses, permits and other approvals in order to operate, which can require significant capital expenditure and operating costs.  If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to civil or criminal liability and the imposition of penalties, liens or fines, claims for property damage or personal injury, or environmental clean-up costs.  In addition, existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities, which could require additional unexpected expenditures or cause us to reevaluate the feasibility of continued operations at certain sites and have a detrimental effect on our business.In connection with certain acquisitions, we assumed liabilities associated with the environmental condition of certain properties, regardless of when such liabilities arose, whether known or unknown, and in some cases agreed to indemnify the former owners of those properties for environmental liabilities.  Future steps to bring our facilities into compliance or to address contamination from legacy operations, if necessary, could be expensive and could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.  We expect our environmental compliance expenditures to be substantial in the future due to the continuing trends toward stricter standards, greater regulation, more extensive permitting requirements and an increase in the number of assets we operate.The characteristics of coal may make it difficult for coal users to comply with various environmental standards related to coal combustion or utilization and the use of alternative energy sources for power generation as mandated by states could reduce coal consumption.  As a result, coal users may switch to other fuels, which would affect the volume of our sales and the price of our products.Coal contains impurities, including but not limited to sulfur, mercury, chlorine, carbon and other elements or compounds, many of which are released into the air when coal is burned.  More stringent environmental regulations of emissions from coal-fueled power plants could increase the costs of using coal, thereby reducing demand for coal as a fuel source and the volume and price of our coal sales.  Renewable energy requirements and changes to regulations could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative in the planning and building of power plants in the future.Proposed reductions in emissions of mercury, sulfur dioxides, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, or greenhouse gases may require the installation of costly emission control technology or the implementation of other measures.  For example, in order to meet the federal Clean Air Act limits for SO2 emission from power plants, coal users may need to install scrubbers, use SO2 emission allowances (some of which they may purchase), blend high-sulfur coal with low-sulfur coal or switch to other fuels.  Reductions in mercury emission required by certain states and the EPA will likely require some power plants to install new equipment, at substantial cost, or discourage the use of certain coals containing higher levels of mercury.  On June 2, 2014, the EPA proposed the Clean Power Plan to cut carbon emissions from existing electric generating units.  The design of the Clean Power Plan is to decrease existing coal-fired generation, increase the utilization of existing gas generation, increase renewable energy and demand side management.  This rule could have a significant impact on our coal and natural gas generating fleet.  The rule calls for states to develop plans to meet their assigned emission rate targets by 2030.  The rule also allows states to formulate a regional approach whereby they would join with other states and be assigned a new single target for the group.  We are currently evaluating this proposal, but cannot predict the impact on operations as this rule is expected to be final in June 2015.  State plans are expected to be due at the earliest in June 2016, with extensions possible to 2017 and 2018.Coal competes with other energy sources, such as natural gas, wind, solar and hydropower.  If the Clean Power Plan Rule regulations were to have an adverse effect on coal as a domestic energy source, this rule could have a significant impact on our coal mining operations.Existing or proposed legislation focusing on emissions enacted by the United States or individual states could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative for our customers and could impose a tax or fee on the producer of the coal.  If our customers decrease the volume of coal they purchase from us or switch to alternative fuels as a result of existing or future environmental regulations aimed at reducing emissions, our operations and financial results could be adversely impacted. 66"
14,BKH,BLACK HILLS CORP,2014-02-26,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSThe nature of our business subjects us to a number of uncertainties and risks. The following risk factors and other risk factors that we discuss in our periodic reports filed with the SEC should be considered for a better understanding of our Company. These important factors and other matters discussed herein could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ materially.OPERATING RISKSOur current or future development, expansion and acquisition activities may not be successful, which could impair our ability to execute our growth strategy.Execution of our future growth plan is dependent on successful ongoing and future development, expansion and acquisition activities. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to complete development projects or acquisitions we undertake or continue to develop attractive opportunities for growth. Factors that could cause our development, expansion, and acquisition activities to be unsuccessful include:•Our inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals or the imposition of adverse conditions upon the approval of any acquisition;•Our inability to secure adequate rates through regulatory proceedings;•Our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all;•The possibility that one or more credit rating agencies would downgrade our issuer credit rating to below investment grade, thus increasing our cost of doing business;•Our inability to successfully integrate any businesses we acquire;•Our inability to retain management or other key personnel;•Our inability to negotiate acceptable acquisition, construction, fuel supply, power sales or other material agreements;•The trend of utilities building their own generation or looking for developers to develop and build projects for sale to utilities under turnkey arrangements;•Reduced growth in the demand for utility services in the markets we serve;•Changes in federal, state, local or tribal laws and regulations, particularly those which would make it more difficult or costly to fully develop our coal reserves, our oil and gas reserves and our generation capacity;•Fuel prices or fuel supply constraints;•Pipeline capacity and transmission constraints; •Competition within our industry and with producers of competing energy sources; and•Changes in tax rates and policies. 51Our financial performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities. If the risks involved in our operations are not appropriately managed or mitigated, our operations may not be successful and this could adversely affect our results of operations.Operating electric generating facilities, oil and gas properties, the coal mine and electric and natural gas distribution systems involves risks, including:•Operational limitations imposed by environmental and other regulatory requirements;•Interruptions to supply of fuel and other commodities used in generation and distribution. The Utilities Group purchases fuel from a number of suppliers. Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the delivery of fuel due to various factors, including but not limited to, transportation delays, labor relations, weather, and environmental regulations, which could limit the Utilities Group’s ability to operate their facilities;•Breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, including those operated by PacifiCorp at the Wyodak plant;•Inability to recruit and retain skilled technical labor;•Disrupted transmission and distribution. We depend on transmission and distribution facilities, including those operated by unaffiliated parties, to deliver the electricity and gas that we sell to our retail and wholesale customers. If transmission is interrupted, our ability to sell or deliver product and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered;•Operating hazards such as leaks, mechanical problems and accidents, including explosions, affecting our natural gas distribution system which could impact public safety, reliability and customer confidence;•Electricity is dangerous for employees and the general public should they come in contact with power lines or electrical equipment. Natural conditions and other disasters such as wind, lightning and winter storms can cause wildfires, pole failures and associated property damage and outages. For example, as described in more detail under “Legal Proceedings,” a fire investigator concluded that a forest and grassland fire in the western Black Hills of Wyoming and South Dakota in 2012 was caused by the failure of a transmission structure owned, operated and maintained by Black Hills Power, and claims have been made against us related to the fire;   •Disruption in the functioning of our information technology and network infrastructure which are vulnerable to disability, failures and unauthorized access. If our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions; and •Labor relations. Approximately 31 percent of our employees are represented by a total of six collective bargaining agreements.Construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve significant risks which could reduce profitability.The construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve many risks, including:•The inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals along with the cost of complying with or satisfying conditions imposed upon such approvals;•Contractual restrictions upon the timing of scheduled outages;•The cost of supplying or securing replacement power during scheduled and unscheduled outages;•The unavailability or increased cost of equipment;•The cost of recruiting and retaining or the unavailability of skilled labor;•Supply interruptions, work stoppages and labor disputes; 52•Increased capital and operating costs to comply with increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations;•Opposition by members of public or special-interest groups;•Weather interferences;•Availability and cost of fuel supplies;•Unexpected engineering, environmental and geological problems; and•Unanticipated cost overruns.The ongoing operation of our facilities involves many of the risks described above, in addition to risks relating to the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency. New plants may employ recently developed and technologically complex equipment, including newer environmental emission control technology. Any of these risks could cause us to operate below expected capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues, increase expenses or cause us to incur higher operating and maintenance costs and penalties. While we maintain insurance, obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance and our rights under warranties or performance guarantees may not be timely or adequate to cover lost revenues, increased expenses, liability or liquidated damage payments.Operating results can be adversely affected by variations from normal weather conditions.Our utility businesses are seasonal businesses, and weather patterns can have a material impact on our operating performance. Demand for electricity is typically greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating. Because natural gas is primarily used for residential and commercial heating, the demand for this product depends heavily upon winter weather patterns throughout our service territory and a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating seasons. Accordingly, our utility operations have historically generated lower revenues and income when weather conditions are cooler than normal in the summer and warmer than normal in the winter. Unusually mild summers and winters therefore could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  Our businesses are located in areas that could be subject to seasonal natural disasters such as severe snow and ice storms, flooding and wildfires. These factors could result in interruption of our business, damage to our property such as power lines and substations, and repair and clean-up costs associated with these storms.  We may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring transmission and distribution property following these natural disasters through a change in our regulated rates thereby resulting in a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.   Our coal mining operations are subject to operating risks that are beyond our control which could affect our profitability and production levels. Our surface mining operations could be disrupted or materially affected due to adverse weather or natural disasters such as heavy snow, strong winds, rain or flooding. Additionally, weather patterns can also affect electricity demand. Extreme temperatures, both hot and cold, cause increased power usage, and therefore, increased generating requirements and the use of coal. Conversely, mild temperatures could result in lower electrical demand.Weather conditions can also limit or temporarily halt our drilling, completion, and producing activities and other crude oil and natural gas operations. Primarily in the winter and spring, our operations can be curtailed because of cold, snow, and wet conditions.  Severe weather could further curtail these operations, including drilling, and completion of new wells or production from existing wells. In addition, weather conditions and other events could temporarily impair our ability to transport our crude oil and natural gas production. 53Prices for some of our products and services as well as a portion of our operating costs are volatile and may cause our revenues and expenses to fluctuate significantly.A portion of our net income is attributable to sales of contract and off-system wholesale electricity and natural gas. Energy prices are influenced by many factors outside our control, including, among other things, fuel prices, transmission constraints, supply and demand, weather, general economic conditions, and the rules, regulations and actions of system operators in those markets. Moreover, unlike most other commodities, electricity cannot be stored and therefore must be produced concurrently with its use. As a result, wholesale power markets are subject to significant, unpredictable price fluctuations over relatively short periods of time.The success of our crude oil and natural gas operations is affected by the prevailing market prices of crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices and markets historically have also been, and are likely to continue to be, unpredictable. A decrease in crude oil or natural gas prices would not only reduce revenues and profits, but would also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable, and may result in charges to earnings for impairment of the net capitalized cost of these assets. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for crude oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control.The proliferation of domestic crude oil and natural gas shale plays in recent years has provided the market with an abundant new supply of crude oil and natural gas. The increase in domestic natural gas supply has driven prices down in recent years. The ratio of crude oil to natural gas prices is near all-time high levels, far in excess of the six to one heating value equivalent ratio. There is also risk that the increased domestic crude oil resources could drive crude oil prices lower. Our mining operation requires reliable supplies of replacement parts, explosives, fuel, tires and steel-related products. If the cost of these increase significantly, or if sources of supplies and mining equipment become unavailable to meet our replacement demands, our productivity and profitability could be lower than our current expectations. In recent years, industry-wide demand growth exceeded supply growth for certain surface mining equipment and off-the-road tires. As a result, lead times for procuring some items generally increased to several months and prices for these items increased significantly.Our operations rely on storage and transportation assets owned by third parties to satisfy our obligations. If storage capacity is inadequate or transportation is disrupted, our ability to satisfy our obligations may be hindered.Our Utilities Group and Power Generation segment rely on pipeline companies and other owners of gas storage facilities to deliver natural gas to ratepayers, to supply our natural gas-fired power plants and to hedge commodity costs. If storage capacity is inadequate or transportation is disrupted, our ability to satisfy our obligations may be hindered. As a result, we may be responsible for damages incurred by our counterparties, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at then-current market rates, or for penalties imposed by state regulatory authorities.Threats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism, cyber-attacks, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt our businesses, or the businesses of third parties, may impact our operations in unpredictable ways and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.We are subject to the potentially adverse operating and financial effects of terrorist acts and threats, as well as cyber-attacks and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups. Our generation, transmission and distribution facilities, fuel storage facilities, information technology systems and other infrastructure facilities and systems and physical assets, could be direct targets of, or indirectly affected by, such activities. Terrorist acts or other similar events could harm our businesses by limiting their ability to generate, purchase or transmit power and by delaying their development and construction of new generating facilities and capital improvements to existing facilities. These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair and insure our assets, and could adversely affect our operations by contributing to disruption of supplies and markets for natural gas, oil and other fuels. They could also impair our ability to raise capital by contributing to financial instability and lower economic activity.We operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite our implementation of security measures, all of our technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access, including cyber-attacks. If our technology systems were to fail or be breached and be unable to recover in a timely way, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive confidential and other data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect not only on our financial results, but on our public reputation as well. 54The implementation of security guidelines and measures and maintenance of insurance, to the extent available, addressing such activities could increase costs. These types of events could materially adversely affect our financial results. In addition, these types of events could require significant management attention and resources, and could adversely affect our reputation among customers and the public.A disruption of the regional electric transmission grid, natural gas pipeline infrastructure or other fuel sources, could negatively impact our business. Because generation, transmission systems and natural gas pipelines are part of an interconnected system, we face the risk of possible loss of business due to a disruption caused by the impact of an event on the interconnected system (such as severe weather or a generator or transmission facility outage, pipeline rupture, or a sudden significant increase or decrease in wind generation) within our system or within a neighboring system. Any such disruption could have a material impact on our financial results.Increased risks of regulatory penalties could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.Business activities in the energy sector are heavily regulated, primarily by agencies of the federal government. Agencies that historically sought voluntary compliance, or issued non-monetary sanctions, now employ mandatory civil penalty structures for regulatory violations. The FERC, CFTC, EPA, OSHA, SEC and MSHA may impose significant and sometimes punitive civil penalties to enforce compliance requirements relative to our business. In addition, FERC delegated certain aspects of authority for enforcement of electric system reliability standards to the NERC, with similar penalty authority for violations. If a serious regulatory violation occurred, and penalties were imposed by FERC or another federal agency, this action could have a material adverse effect on our operations and/or our financial results.Certain Federal laws, including the Migratory Bird Act and the Endangered Species Act, provide special protection to certain designated species.  These laws and any state equivalents provide for significant civil and criminal penalties for non-permitted activities that result in harm to or harassment of certain protected animals, including damage to their habitats.  If such species are located in an area in which we conduct operations, or if additional species in those areas become subject to protection, our operations and development projects, particularly transmission, generation, wind, pipeline or drilling projects, could be restricted or delayed, or we could be required to implement expensive mitigation measures.Our energy production, transmission and distribution activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other catastrophic events. These events could disrupt or impair our operations, create additional costs and cause substantial loss to us.Inherent in our natural gas and electricity transmission and distribution activities, as well as our production, transportation and storage of crude oil and natural gas and our coal mining operations, are a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, blow-outs, fires, releases of hazardous materials, explosions and mechanical problems that could cause substantial adverse financial impacts. These events could result in injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property or natural resources (including public parks), environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, and substantial losses to us. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Particularly for our transmission and distribution lines located near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering areas, the damages resulting from any such events could be significant. 55UtilitiesRegulatory commissions may refuse to approve some or all of the utility rate increases we have requested or may request in the future, or may determine that amounts passed through to customers were not prudently incurred and therefore are not recoverable, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.Our regulated electric and gas utility operations are subject to cost-of-service regulation and earnings oversight from federal and state utility commissions. This regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of desired earnings levels. Our retail electric and gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding. The rates that we are allowed to charge may or may not match our related costs and allowed return on invested capital at any given time. While rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that the state public utility commissions will judge all of our costs, including our direct and allocated borrowing and debt service costs, to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that produce a full recovery of our costs and the return on invested capital allowed by the applicable state public utility commission.To some degree, each of our gas and electric utilities are permitted to recover certain costs (such as increased fuel and purchased power costs) without having to file a rate case. To the extent we are able to pass through such costs to our customers and a state public utility commission subsequently determines that such costs should not have been paid by the customers; we may be required to refund such costs. Any such costs not recovered through rates, or any such refund, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flow.If market or other conditions adversely affect operations or require us to make changes to our business strategy in any of our utility businesses, we may be forced to record a non-cash goodwill impairment charge. Any significant impairment of our goodwill related to these utilities would cause a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net income and shareholders’ equity.We had approximately $353 million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets as of Dec. 31, 2013. A substantial portion of the goodwill is related to the Aquila Transaction. If we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect operations in any of our businesses, we may be forced to record a non-cash impairment charge, which would reduce our reported assets, net income and shareholders’ equity. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill in the period the determination is made. The testing of goodwill for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including: future business operating performance; changes in economic conditions, and interest rates, regulatory, industry or market conditions, changes in business operations, changes in competition or changes in technologies. Any changes in key assumptions, or actual performance compared with key assumptions, about our business and its future prospects could affect the fair value of one or more business segments, which may result in an impairment charge.Municipal governments may seek to limit or deny franchise privileges which could inhibit our ability to secure adequate recovery of our investment in assets subject to condemnation.Municipal governments within our utility service territories possess the power of condemnation and could establish a municipal utility within a portion of our current service territories by limiting or denying franchise privileges for our operations, and exercising powers of condemnation over all or part of our utility assets within municipal boundaries. Although condemnation is a process that is subject to constitutional protections requiring just and fair compensation, as with any judicial procedure, the outcome is uncertain. If a municipality sought to pursue this course of action, we cannot assure that we would secure adequate recovery of our investment in assets subject to condemnation. 56Power GenerationOur ability to successfully complete the sale of CTII to the City of Gillette and execute the purchase option for the sale of Wygen I to Cheyenne Light Fuel & Power could adversely affect our Power Generation segment.  The inability to obtain power sales contracts at reasonable rates to fully utilize these assets subsequent to the expiration of long-term contracts could affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.Black Hills Wyoming entered into an agreement to sell its 40 megawatt CTII to the City of Gillette in August 2014 upon expiration of an existing power sales agreement under which Black Hills Power sells the output of the CTII to Cheyenne Light.  This sale is subject to FERC approval and certain other requirements included in the contract.Black Hills Wyoming has a power sales agreement with Cheyenne Light which expires in December 2022. This power sales agreement includes an option for Cheyenne Light to purchase Black Hills Wyoming’s ownership interest in the Wygen I facility between 2013 and 2019. This purchase by Cheyenne Light would be subject to WPSC approval in order to obtain regulatory treatment. Coal MiningIf the assumptions underlying our reclamation and mine closure obligations are materially inaccurate, our costs could be significantly greater than anticipated or be incurred sooner than anticipated.Our mining consists of surface mining operations. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and similar state laws and regulation establish operations, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining. We estimate our total reclamation liabilities based on permit requirements, engineering studies, and our engineering expertise related to these requirements. The estimate of ultimate reclamation liability is reviewed periodically by our management and engineers, and by government regulators. The estimated liability can change significantly if actual costs vary from our original assumptions or if government regulations change significantly. GAAP requires that asset retirement obligations be recorded as a liability based on fair value, which reflects the present value of the estimated future cash flows. In estimating future cash flows, we consider the estimated current cost of reclamation and apply inflation rates. The resulting estimated reclamation obligations could change significantly if actual amounts or the timing of these expenses change significantly from our assumptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Estimates of the quality and quantity of our coal reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in three dimensional structural modeling. Significant inaccuracies in interpretation or modeling could materially affect the estimated quantity and quality of our reserve which could adversely affect our results of operations.There are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of coal reserves. The process of coal volume estimation requires interpretations of drill hole log data and subsequent computer modeling of the intersected deposit. Significant inaccuracies in interpretation or modeling could materially affect the quantity and quality of our reserve estimates. The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of engineering and geological interpretation, conditions encountered during actual reserve recovery and undetected deposit anomalies. Variance from the assumptions used and drill hole modeling density could result in additions or deletions from our volume estimates. In addition, future environmental, economic or geologic changes may occur or become known that require reserve revisions either upward or downward from prior reserve estimates. 57Oil and GasEstimates of the quantity and value of our proved oil and gas reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves. Significant inaccuracies in interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves which could adversely affect our results of operations.There are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and their associated value. The process of estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves requires interpretation of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Significant inaccuracies in interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves. The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretations and judgment, and the assumptions used regarding quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves, future capital expenditures and prices for crude oil and natural gas. Actual prices, production, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves may vary from those assumed in our estimates. These variances may be significant. Any significant variance from the assumptions used could cause the actual quantity of our reserves, and future net cash flow, to be materially different from our estimates. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production, changes in future capital expenditures and fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices after the date of the estimate may result in substantial upward or downward revisions.The potential adoption of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in restrictions which could increase costs and cause delays to the completion of certain oil and gas wells, and potentially preclude the economic drilling and completion of wells in certain reservoirs.Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry used extensively for decades to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. We routinely apply hydraulic fracturing techniques on our crude oil and natural gas properties. Hydraulic fracturing involves using mostly water, sand, and a small amount of certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to enhance flow of hydrocarbons into the well-bore. The process is typically regulated by state crude oil and natural gas commissions; however, the EPA does assert federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities when diesel comprises part of the fracturing fluid. In addition several agencies of the federal government including the EPA and the BLM are conducting studies of the fracturing stimulation process which may result in additional regulations. In May 2013, the U.S. Department of the Interior re-proposed rules regulating the use of hydraulic fracturing on Federal and Indian Lands, with final action expected in 2014. In addition, legislation has been introduced before Congress, called the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act, to provide the federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process.Certain states have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure, and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. In the event federal, state, local or municipal legal restrictions on the hydraulic fracturing are adopted in areas where we are conducting or in the future plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply with such regulations that may be significant, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from utilizing fracture stimulation and effectively preclude the drilling of wells.Exploratory and development drilling are speculative activities that may not result in commercially productive reserves. Lack of drilling success could result in uneconomical investments and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Drilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered. There can be no assurance that new wells drilled by us or in which we have an interest will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment. Drilling for oil and gas may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells, but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain. Our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including economic conditions, mechanical problems, pressure or irregularities in formations, title problems, weather conditions, compliance with governmental rules and regulations and shortages in or delays in the delivery of equipment and services. Such equipment shortages and delays are caused by the high demand for rigs and other needed equipment by a large number of companies in active drilling basins. High activity in some basins may cause shortages of rigs and equipment in other basins. Our future drilling activities may not be successful. Lack of drilling success could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 58We could incur additional and substantial write-downs of the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties, which would cause a decrease in our assets and stockholders' equity and could adversely impact our results of operations.We review the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties under the full cost accounting rules of the SEC on a quarterly basis. This quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test. Under the ceiling test, capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects. In calculating future net revenues, SEC-defined commodity prices and recent costs are utilized. Such prices and costs are utilized except when different prices and costs are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts. Two primary factors in the ceiling test are natural gas and crude oil reserve quantities and SEC-defined crude oil and gas prices, both of which impact the present value of estimated future net revenues. Revisions to estimates of natural gas and crude oil reserves, or an increase or decrease in prices, can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues. Any excess of the net book value, less deferred income taxes, is generally written off as an expense.We recorded a non-cash impairment charge in the second quarter of 2012 due to the full cost ceiling limitations. We may have to record additional non-cash impairment charges in the future if commodity prices drive the SEC-defined prices below levels that precipitated the 2012 impairment. See Note 12 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.FINANCING RISKSOur credit ratings could be lowered below investment grade in the future. If this were to occur, it could impact our access to capital, our cost of capital and our other operating costs.Our issuer credit rating is Baa2 (Positive outlook) by Moody’s; BBB (Stable outlook) by S&P; and BBB (Positive outlook) by Fitch. Reduction of our credit ratings could impair our ability to refinance or repay our existing debt and to complete new financings on reasonable terms, or at all. A downgrade could also result in counterparties requiring us to post additional collateral under existing or new contracts or trades. In addition, a ratings downgrade would increase our interest expense under some of our existing debt obligations, including borrowings under our credit facilities.Derivatives regulations included in current financial reform legislation could impede our ability to manage business and financial risks by restricting our use of derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates.In July 2010, Dodd-Frank was passed by Congress and signed into law. Dodd-Frank contains significant derivatives regulations, including a requirement that certain transactions be cleared resulting in a requirement to post cash collateral (commonly referred to as “margin”) for such transactions. Dodd-Frank provides for a potential exception from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end-users such as utilities and it includes a number of defined terms that will be used in determining how this exception applies to particular derivative transactions and the parties to those transactions. We use crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments for our hedging activities for our oil and gas production activities and our gas utility operations. We also use interest rate derivative instruments to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations. As a result of Dodd-Frank regulations promulgated by the CFTC, we may be required to post collateral to clearing entities for certain swap transactions we enter into. In addition, many of the transactions which were previously classified as swaps have been converted to exchange-traded futures contracts, which are subject to futures margin posting requirements. Such a requirement could have a significant impact on our business by reducing our ability to execute derivative transactions to reduce commodity price and interest rate uncertainty and to protect cash flows. Requirements to post collateral may cause significant liquidity issues by reducing our ability to use cash for investment or other corporate purposes, or may require us to increase our level of debt. In addition, a requirement for our counterparties to post collateral could result in additional costs being passed on to us, thereby decreasing our profitability. 59Our hedging activities that are designed to protect against commodity price and financial market risks may cause fluctuations in reported financial results due to accounting requirements associated with such activities.We use various financial contracts and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps to manage commodity price and financial market risks. The timing of the recognition of gains or losses on these economic hedges in accordance with GAAP does not always match up with the gains or losses on the commodities or assets being hedged. The difference in accounting can result in volatility in reported results, even though the expected profit margin may be essentially unchanged from the dates the transactions were consummated.Our use of derivative financial instruments could result in material financial losses.From time to time, we have sought to limit a portion of the potential adverse effects resulting from changes in commodity prices and interest rates by using derivative financial instruments and other hedging mechanisms. To the extent that we hedge our commodity price and interest rate exposures, we forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in our favor. In addition, even though they are closely monitored by management, our hedging activities can result in losses. Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the hedge arrangement, the hedge is economically imperfect, commodity prices or interest rates move unfavorably related to our physical or financial positions, or hedging policies and procedures are not followed.Market performance or changes in other assumptions could require us to make significant unplanned contributions to our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. Increasing costs associated with our defined benefit retirement plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.We have two defined benefit pension plans and three non-pension postretirement plans that cover certain eligible employees. Assumptions related to future costs, return on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on our funding requirements and the expense recognized related to these plans. These estimates and assumptions may change based on actual return on plan assets, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations.We rely on cash distributions from our subsidiaries to make and maintain dividends and debt payments. Our subsidiaries may not be allowed or may be unable to make dividend payments or loan funds to us, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations or pay dividends to our shareholders.We are a holding company. Our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets. Our operating cash flow and ability to service our indebtedness depend on the operating cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends or advances. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available for that purpose, whether by dividends or otherwise. In addition, each subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to us depends on any applicable contractual or regulatory restrictions that may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of cash, working capital or debt service funds.We expect to continue our policy of paying regular cash dividends. However, there is no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on our future earnings, capital requirements, and financial conditions, and are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Our operating subsidiaries have certain restrictions on their ability to transfer funds in the form of dividends or loans to us. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these restrictions and their impact on our liquidity.We may be unable to obtain the financing needed to refinance debt, fund planned capital expenditures or otherwise execute our operating strategy. Lack of credit at reasonable rates would have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.Our ability to execute our operating strategy is highly dependent upon our access to capital. Historically, we have addressed our liquidity needs (including funds required to make scheduled principal and interest payments, refinance debt and fund working capital and planned capital expenditures) with operating cash flow, borrowings under credit facilities, proceeds of debt and equity offerings and proceeds from asset sales. Our ability to access the capital markets and the costs and terms of available financing depend on many factors, including changes in our credit ratings, changes in the federal or state regulatory environment affecting energy companies, volatility in commodity or electricity prices and general economic and market conditions. 60In addition, because we are a holding company and our utility assets are owned by our subsidiaries, if we are unable to adequately access the credit markets, we could be required to take additional measures designed to ensure that our utility subsidiaries are adequately capitalized to provide safe and reliable service. Possible additional measures would be evaluated in the context of then-prevailing market conditions, prudent financial management and any applicable regulatory requirements.National and regional economic conditions may cause increased counterparty credit risk, late payments and uncollectible accounts, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.A future recession may lead to an increase in late payments from retail, commercial and industrial utility customers, as well as our non-utility customers. If late payments and uncollectible accounts increase, earnings and cash flows from our continuing operations may be reduced.Our ability to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. Our insurance coverage may not provide protection against all significant losses.Our ability to obtain insurance, as well as the cost of such insurance, could be affected by developments affecting insurance businesses, international, national, state or local events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. Insurance coverage may not continue to be available at all, or at rates or on terms similar to those presently available to us. A loss for which we are not fully insured could materially and adversely affect our financial results. Our insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which the Company may be subject, including but not limited to environmental hazards, fire-related liability from natural events or inadequate facility maintenance, risks associated with our oil and gas exploration and production activities, distribution property losses, cyber-security risks and dangers that exist in the gathering and transportation in pipelines.Our operations are also subject to all the hazards and risks normally incident to the development, exploitation, production and transportation of, and the exploration for, oil and gas, including unusual or unexpected geologic formations, pressures, down hole fires, mechanical failures, blowouts, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, gas or well fluids, pollution and other environmental risks. These hazards could result in substantial losses to us due to injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution and other environmental damage and suspension of operations. We maintain insurance coverage for our operated wells and we participate in insurance coverage maintained by the operators of our wells, although there can be no assurances that such coverage will be sufficient to prevent a material adverse effect to us if any of the foregoing events occur.Increasing costs associated with our health care plans and other benefits may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.The costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees have increased substantially in recent years. We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs related to health care plans for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise. The increasing costs and funding requirements associated with our health care plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.In March 2010, the President of the United States signed PPACA as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “2010 Acts”). The 2010 Acts will have a substantial impact on health care providers, insurers, employers and individuals. The 2010 Acts will impact employers and businesses differently depending on the size of the organization and the specific impacts on a company’s employees. Certain provisions of the 2010 Acts are effective while other provisions of the 2010 Acts will be effective in future years. The 2010 Acts could require, among other things, changes to our current employee benefit plans and in our administrative and accounting processes, as well as changes to the cost of our plans. The ultimate extent and cost of these changes cannot be determined at this time and are being evaluated and updated as related regulations and interpretations of the 2010 Acts become available.Our electric and gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding. Within our utility rates we have generally recovered the cost of providing employee benefits. As benefit costs continue to rise, there can be no assurance that the state public utility commissions will allow recovery. 61We have deferred a substantial amount of income tax related to various tax planning strategies, including the deferral of a gain associated with the assets sold in the IPP Transaction. If the Internal Revenue Service successfully challenges these tax positions, our results of operations, financial position or liquidity could be adversely affected.We have deferred a substantial amount of tax payments through various tax planning strategies including the deferral of approximately $125 million in income taxes associated with the IPP Transaction and the Aquila Transaction.The IRS has challenged our position with respect to the like-kind exchange. As stated in a revised Notice of Proposed Adjustment received from the IRS in April 2013, their position is to disallow a significant portion of the gain deferred as reported on our originally filed 2008 tax return. We disagree with such a position and will pursue all available IRS and/or legal channels to challenge the proposed adjustment.  In the event we are unsuccessful in our challenge, the amount of deferred income tax on a worst case basis that could be accelerated into a current tax payable would be approximately $125 million. However, we would be entitled to a tax benefit associated with the additional tax depreciation that would result from increasing the depreciable cost for tax purposes in the assets acquired. This net current tax liability would accrue interest, which is estimated to be approximately $23 million before income tax effect.In certain circumstances, the IRS may assess penalties when challenging our tax positions. If we were unsuccessful in defending against these penalties, it may have a material impact on our results of operations. No penalties have been assessed by the IRS in connection with the like-kind exchange transaction.An effective system of internal control may not be maintained, leading to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management to make an assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal controls. Our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of these controls. During their assessment of these controls, management or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify areas of weakness in control design or effectiveness, which may lead to the conclusion that a material weakness in internal control exists. Any control deficiencies we identify in the future could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis, which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports or have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business or access sources of liquidity.ENVIRONMENTAL RISKSFederal and state laws concerning greenhouse gas regulations and air emissions may materially increase our generation and production costs and could render some of our generating units uneconomical to operate and maintain.We own and operate regulated and non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants in South Dakota, Wyoming, and Colorado. Recent developments under federal and state laws and regulations governing air emissions from fossil-fuel generating plants will likely result in more stringent emission limitations, which could have a material impact on our costs of operations. Various pending or final state and EPA regulations that will impact our facilities are also discussed in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption “Environmental Matters.”On May 20, 2011, with amendments on Dec. 21, 2012, the EPA’s Industrial and Commercial Boiler regulations became effective, which provide for hazardous air pollutant-related emission limits and monitoring requirements. The compliance deadline for this rule is March 21, 2014. Engineering evaluations were completed and confirmed the significant impact on our Neil Simpson I, Osage and Ben French facilities. These units will be retired on or before the March 21, 2014 compliance deadline. Although we will seek recovery for the remaining net book values of these plants and prudent decommissioning costs of these units, we cannot be assured of this recovery.On Feb. 16, 2012, the EPA published in the Federal Register the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from Coal and Oil Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units (MATS), with an effective date of April 16, 2012. Affected units have a compliance deadline of April 16, 2015, with a pathway defined to apply for a one year extension due to certain circumstances. It is expected that all of our plants will be in compliance by the initial 2015 deadline, with the primary impacts to Neil Simpson II, Wygen I, Wygen II, Wygen III and the Wyodak Plant including installation of mercury sorbent injection systems, along with additional monitoring and testing requirements. 62The GHG Tailoring Rule, implementing regulations of GHG for permitting purposes, became effective in June 2010. This rule will impact us in the event of a major modification at an existing facility or in the event of a new major source as defined by EPA regulations. Upon renewal of operating permits for existing facilities monitoring and reporting requirements will be implemented. New projects or major modifications to existing projects will result in a Best Available Control Technology review that could impose more stringent emissions control practices and technologies. The EPA’s GHG New Source Performance Standard for new steam electric generating units was re-proposed in September 2013 and is expected to be final in the spring of 2014. As proposed, it effectively prohibits new coal fired units until carbon capture and sequestration becomes technically and economically feasible. It also effectively prohibits simple cycle natural gas combustion turbines from generating more than one-third of their capacity, averaged over a three year period. In 2014, we expect the EPA, to propose regulations for GHG emissions from existing steam electric generating units. This rule could have a significant impact on our coal and natural gas generating fleet.Due to uncertainty as to the final outcome of federal climate change legislation, or regulatory changes under the Clean Air Act, we cannot definitively estimate the effect of GHG legislation or regulation on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The impact of GHG legislation or regulation on our company will depend upon many factors, including but not limited to the timing of implementation, the GHG sources that are regulated, the overall GHG emissions cap level, and the availability of technologies to control or reduce GHG emissions. If a “cap and trade” structure is implemented, the impact will depend on the degree to which offsets are allowed, the allocation of emission allowances to specific sources, and the effect of carbon regulation on natural gas and coal prices.New or more stringent regulations or other energy efficiency requirements could require us to incur significant additional costs relating to, among other things, the installation of additional emission control equipment, the acceleration of capital expenditures, the purchase of additional emissions allowances or offsets, the acquisition or development of additional energy supply from renewable resources, and the closure of certain generating facilities. To the extent our regulated fossil-fuel generating plants are included in rate base we will attempt to recover costs associated with complying with emission standards or other requirements. We will also attempt to recover the emission compliance costs of our non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants from utility and other purchasers of the power generated by those non-regulated power plants. Any unrecovered costs could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, future changes in environmental regulations governing air emissions could render some of our power generating units more expensive or uneconomical to operate and maintain.The failure to achieve or maintain compliance with existing or future governmental laws, regulations or requirements could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Additionally, the potentially high cost of complying with such requirements or addressing environmental liabilities could also adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.Our business is subject to extensive energy, environmental and other laws and regulations of federal, state, tribal and local authorities. We generally must obtain and comply with a variety of regulations, licenses, permits and other approvals in order to operate, which can require significant capital expenditure and operating costs. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to civil or criminal liability and the imposition of penalties, liens or fines, claims for property damage or personal injury, or environmental clean-up costs. In addition, existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted, and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities, which could require additional unexpected expenditures or cause us to reevaluate the feasibility of continued operations at certain sites, and have a detrimental effect on our business.In connection with certain acquisitions, we assumed liabilities associated with the environmental condition of certain properties, regardless of when such liabilities arose, whether known or unknown, and in some cases agreed to indemnify the former owners of those properties for environmental liabilities. Future steps to bring our facilities into compliance or to address contamination from legacy operations, if necessary, could be expensive and could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition. We expect our environmental compliance expenditures to be substantial in the future due to the continuing trends toward stricter standards, greater regulation, more extensive permitting requirements and an increase in the number of assets we operate. 63The characteristics of coal may make it difficult for coal users to comply with various environmental standards related to coal combustion or utilization and the use of alternative energy sources for power generation as mandated by states could reduce coal consumption. As a result, coal users may switch to other fuels, which could affect the volume of our sales and the price of our products.Coal contains impurities, including but not limited to sulfur, mercury, chlorine, carbon and other elements or compounds, many of which are released into the air when coal is burned. More stringent environmental regulations of emissions from coal-fueled power plants could increase the costs of using coal, thereby reducing demand for coal as a fuel source and the volume and price of our coal sales. Renewable energy requirements and changes to regulations could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative in the planning and building of power plants in the future.Proposed reductions in emissions of mercury, sulfur dioxides, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, or greenhouse gases may require the installation of costly emission control technology or the implementation of other measures. For example, in order to meet the federal Clean Air Act limits for SO2 emission from power plants, coal users may need to install scrubbers, use SO2 emission allowances (some of which they may purchase), blend high-sulfur coal with low-sulfur coal or switch to other fuels. Reductions in mercury emission required by certain states and the EPA will likely require some power plants to install new equipment, at substantial cost, or discourage the use of certain coals containing higher levels of mercury. EPA is scheduled to propose GHG regulations for existing sources in June 2014 which are expected to contain state-specific goals for overall emission reductions. These rules could have a significant impact on our coal fired generating assets and on our coal mine. Existing or proposed legislation focusing on emissions enacted by the United States or individual states could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative for our customers and could impose a tax or fee on the producer of the coal. If our customers decrease the volume of coal they purchase from us or switch to alternative fuels as a result of existing or future environmental regulations aimed at reducing emissions, our operations and financial results could be adversely impacted"
2,BKH,BLACK HILLS CORP,2013-02-25,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSThe nature of our business subjects us to a number of uncertainties and risks. The following risk factors and other risk factors that we discuss in our periodic reports filed with the SEC should be considered for a better understanding of our Company. These important factors and other matters discussed herein could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ materially.OPERATING RISKSOur current or future development, expansion and acquisition activities may not be successful, which could impair our ability to execute our growth strategy.Execution of our future growth plan is dependent on successful ongoing and future development, expansion and acquisition activities. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to complete development projects or acquisitions we undertake or continue to develop attractive opportunities for growth. Factors that could cause our activities to be unsuccessful include:•Our inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals or the imposition of adverse conditions upon the approval of any acquisition;•Our inability to secure adequate rates through regulatory proceedings;•Our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all;•The possibility that one or more credit rating agencies would downgrade our issuer credit rating to below investment grade, thus increasing our cost of doing business;•Our inability to successfully integrate any businesses we acquire;•Our inability to retain management or other key personnel;•Our inability to negotiate acceptable acquisition, construction, fuel supply, power sales or other material agreements;•The trend of utilities building their own generation or looking for developers to develop and build projects for sale to utilities under turnkey arrangements;•Reduced growth in the demand for utility services in the markets we serve;•Changes in federal, state, local or tribal laws and regulations, particularly those which would make it more difficult or costly to fully develop our coal reserves, our oil and gas reserves and our generation capacity;•Fuel prices or fuel supply constraints;•Pipeline capacity and transmission constraints; and•Competition within our industry and with producers of competing energy sources.Our financial performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities. If the risks involved in our operations are not appropriately managed or mitigated, our operations may not be successful and this could adversely affect our results of operations.Operating electric generating facilities, oil and gas properties, the coal mine and electric and natural gas distribution systems involves risks, including:•Operational limitations imposed by environmental and other regulatory requirements;•Interruptions to supply of fuel and other commodities used in generation and distribution. The Utilities Group purchases fuel from a number of suppliers. Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the delivery of fuel due to various factors, including but not limited to, transportation delays, labor relations, weather, and environmental regulations, which could limit the Utilities Groups’ ability to operate their facilities;48•Breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, including those operated by PacifiCorp at the Wyodak plant;•Inability to recruit and retain skilled technical labor;•Disrupted transmission and distribution. We depend on transmission and distribution facilities, including those operated by unaffiliated parties, to deliver the electricity and gas that we sell to our retail and wholesale customers. If transmission is interrupted, our ability to sell or deliver product and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered;•Operating hazards such as leaks, mechanical problems and accidents, including explosions, affecting our natural gas distribution system which could impact public safety, reliability and customer confidence;•Electricity is dangerous for employees and the general public should they come in contact with power lines or electrical equipment.  Natural conditions and other disasters such as wind, lightning and winter storms can cause wildfires, pole failures and associated property damage and outages;   •Disruption in the functioning of our information technology and network infrastructure which are vulnerable to disability, failures and unauthorized access. If our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions; and •Labor relations. Approximately 33 percent of our employees are represented by a total of six collective bargaining agreements.Construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve significant risks which could reduce profitability.The construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve many risks, including:•The inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals along with the cost of complying with or satisfying conditions imposed upon such approvals;•Contractual restrictions upon the timing of scheduled outages;•Cost of supplying or securing replacement power during scheduled and unscheduled outages;•The unavailability or increased cost of equipment;•The cost of recruiting and retaining or the unavailability of skilled labor;•Supply interruptions, work stoppages and labor disputes;•Increased capital and operating costs to comply with increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations;•Opposition by members of public or special-interest groups;•Weather interferences;•Availability and cost of fuel supplies;•Unexpected engineering, environmental and geological problems; and•Unanticipated cost overruns.49The ongoing operation of our facilities involves many of the risks described above, in addition to risks relating to the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency. New plants may employ recently developed and technologically complex equipment, including newer environmental emission control technology. Any of these risks could cause us to operate below expected capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues, increase expenses or cause us to incur higher operating and maintenance costs and penalties. While we maintain insurance, obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance and our rights under warranties or performance guarantees may not be timely or adequate to cover lost revenues, increased expenses or liquidated damage payments.Operating results can be adversely affected by variations from normal weather conditions.Our utility businesses are seasonal businesses, and weather patterns can have a material impact on our operating performance. Demand for electricity is typically greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating. Because natural gas is primarily used for residential and commercial heating, the demand for this product depends heavily upon winter weather patterns throughout our service territory and a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating seasons. Accordingly, our utility operations have historically generated lower revenues and income when weather conditions are cooler than normal in the summer and warmer than normal in the winter. Unusually mild summers and winters therefore could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  Our coal mining operations are subject to operating risks that are beyond our control which could affect our profitability and production levels. Our surface mining operations could be disrupted or materially affected due to adverse weather or natural disasters such as heavy snow, rain or flooding. Additionally, weather patterns can also affect electricity demand. Extreme temperatures, both hot and cold, cause increased power usage, and therefore, increased generating requirements and the use of coal. Conversely, mild temperatures could result in lower electrical demand.Weather conditions can also limit or temporarily halt our drilling and producing activities and other crude oil and natural gas operations.  Primarily in the winter and spring, our operations can be curtailed because of cold, snow, and wet conditions.  Severe weather could further curtail these operations, including drilling of new wells or production from existing wells.  In addition, weather conditions and other events could temporarily impair our ability to transport our crude oil and natural gas production.Prices for some of our products and services as well as a portion of our operating costs are volatile and may cause our revenues and expenses to fluctuate significantly.A portion of our net income is attributable to sales of contract and off-system wholesale electricity and natural gas. Energy prices are influenced by many factors outside our control, including, among other things, fuel prices, transmission constraints, supply and demand, weather, general economic conditions, and the rules, regulations and actions of system operators in those markets. Moreover, unlike most other commodities, electricity cannot be stored and therefore must be produced concurrently with its use. As a result, wholesale power markets are subject to significant, unpredictable price fluctuations over relatively short periods of time.The success of our crude oil and natural gas operations is affected by the prevailing market prices of crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices and markets historically have also been, and are likely to continue to be, unpredictable. A decrease in crude oil or natural gas prices would not only reduce revenues and profits, but would also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable, and may result in charges to earnings for impairment of the net capitalized cost of these assets. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for crude oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control.The proliferation of domestic crude oil and natural gas shale plays in recent years has provided the market with an abundant new supply of crude oil and natural gas. Combined with lower demand from the economic downturn, this new and abundant supply source has created record volumes of natural gas in storage, and reduced domestic natural gas prices. In fact, the ratio of crude oil to natural gas prices is at an all-time high, far in excess of the six to one heating value equivalent ratio. This trend is likely to continue for the foreseeable future given the expected further development of domestic shale gas reserves.50Our mining operation requires reliable supplies of replacement parts, explosives, fuel, tires and steel-related products. If the cost of these increase significantly, or if sources of supplies and mining equipment become unavailable to meet our replacement demands, our productivity and profitability could be lower than our current expectations. In recent years, industry-wide demand growth exceeded supply growth for certain surface mining equipment and off-the-road tires. As a result, lead times for procuring some items generally increased to several months and prices for these items increased significantly.Our operations rely on storage and transportation assets owned by third parties to satisfy our obligations. If storage capacity is inadequate or transportation is disrupted, our ability to satisfy our obligations may be hindered.Our Utilities Group and Power Generation segment rely on pipeline companies and other owners of gas storage facilities to deliver natural gas to ratepayers, to supply our natural gas-fired power plants and to hedge commodity costs. If storage capacity is inadequate or transportation is disrupted, our ability to satisfy our obligations may be hindered. As a result, we may be responsible for damages incurred by our counterparties, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at then-current market rates, or for penalties imposed by state regulatory authorities.Threats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism, cyber-attacks, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt our businesses, or the businesses of third parties, may impact our operations in unpredictable ways and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.We are subject to the potentially adverse operating and financial effects of terrorist acts and threats, as well as cyber-attacks and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups. Our generation, transmission and distribution facilities, fuel storage facilities, information technology systems and other infrastructure facilities and systems and physical assets, could be direct targets of, or indirectly affected by, such activities. Terrorist acts or other similar events could harm our businesses by limiting their ability to generate, purchase or transmit power and by delaying their development and construction of new generating facilities and capital improvements to existing facilities. These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair and insure our assets, and could adversely affect our operations by contributing to disruption of supplies and markets for natural gas, oil and other fuels. They could also impair our ability to raise capital by contributing to financial instability and lower economic activity.We operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite our implementation of security measures, all of our technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access, including cyber-attacks. If our technology systems were to fail or be breached and be unable to recover in a timely way, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive confidential and other data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.The implementation of security guidelines and measures and maintenance of insurance, to the extent available, addressing such activities could increase costs. These types of events could materially adversely affect our financial results. In addition, these types of events could require significant management attention and resources, and could adversely affect our reputation among customers and the public.A disruption of the regional electric transmission grid, natural gas pipeline infrastructure or other fuel sources, could negatively impact our business. Because generation, transmission systems and natural gas pipelines are part of an interconnected system, we face the risk of possible loss of business due to a disruption caused by the impact of an event on the interconnected system (such as severe weather or a generator or transmission facility outage, pipeline rupture, or a sudden significant increase or decrease in wind generation) within our system or within a neighboring system. Any such disruption could have a material impact on our financial results.Increased risks of regulatory penalties could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.Business activities in the energy sector are heavily regulated, primarily by agencies of the federal government. Agencies that historically sought voluntary compliance, or issued non-monetary sanctions, now employ mandatory civil penalty structures for regulatory violations. The FERC, CFTC, EPA, OSHA, SEC and MSHA can increasingly impose significant civil penalties to enforce compliance requirements relative to our business. In addition, FERC has delegated certain aspects of authority for enforcement of electric system reliability standards to the NERC, with similar penalty authority for violations. If a serious regulatory violation did occur, and penalties were imposed by FERC or another federal agency, this action could have a material adverse effect on our operations and/or our financial results.51Our energy production, transmission and distribution activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other catastrophic events. These events could disrupt or impair our operations, create additional costs and cause substantial loss to us.Inherent in our natural gas and electricity distribution activities, as well as our production, transportation and storage of crude oil and natural gas and our coal mining operations, are a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, blow-outs, fires, releases of hazardous materials, explosions and mechanical problems that could cause substantial adverse financial impacts. These events could result in injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property or natural resources (including public parks), environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, and substantial losses to us. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Particularly for our distribution lines located near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering areas, the damages resulting from any such events could be significant.UtilitiesRegulatory commissions may refuse to approve some or all of the utility rate increases we have requested or may request in the future, or may determine that amounts passed through to customers were not prudently incurred and therefore are not recoverable, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.Our regulated electric and gas utility operations are subject to cost-of-service regulation and earnings oversight from federal and state utility commissions. This regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of desired earnings levels. Our retail electric and gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding. The rates that we are allowed to charge may or may not match our related costs and allowed return on invested capital at any given time. While rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that the state public utility commissions will judge all of our costs, including our direct and allocated borrowing and debt service costs, to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that produce a full recovery of our costs and the return on invested capital allowed by the applicable state public utility commission.To some degree, each of our gas and electric utilities are permitted to recover certain costs (such as increased fuel and purchased power costs) without having to file a rate case. To the extent we are able to pass through such costs to our customers and a state public utility commission subsequently determines that such costs should not have been paid by the customers; we may be required to refund such costs. Any such costs not recovered through rates, or any such refund, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flow.If market or other conditions adversely affect operations or require us to make changes to our business strategy in any of our utility businesses, we may be forced to record a non-cash goodwill impairment charge. Any significant impairment of our goodwill related to these utilities would cause a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net income and shareholders’ equity.We had approximately $353.4 million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2012. A substantial portion of the goodwill is related to the Aquila Transaction. If we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect operations in any of our businesses, we may be forced to record a non-cash impairment charge, which would reduce our reported assets, net income and shareholders’ equity. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill in the period the determination is made. The testing of goodwill for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including future business operating performance, changes in economic and interest rates, regulatory, industry or market conditions, changes in business operations, changes in competition or changes in technologies. Any changes in key assumptions, or actual performance compared with key assumptions, about our business and its future prospects could affect the fair value of one or more business segments, which may result in an impairment charge.52Municipal governments may seek to limit or deny franchise privileges which could inhibit our ability to secure adequate recovery of our investment in assets subject to condemnation.Municipal governments within our utility service territories possess the power of condemnation and could establish a municipal utility within a portion of our current service territories by limiting or denying franchise privileges for our operations, and exercising powers of condemnation over all or part of our utility assets within municipal boundaries. Although condemnation is a process that is subject to constitutional protections requiring just and fair compensation, as with any judicial procedure, the outcome is uncertain. If a municipality sought to pursue this course of action, we cannot assure that we would secure adequate recovery of our investment in assets subject to condemnation.Coal MiningIf the assumptions underlying our reclamation and mine closure obligations are materially inaccurate, our costs could be significantly greater than anticipated or be incurred sooner than anticipated.Our mining consists of surface mining operations. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and similar state laws and regulation establish operations, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining. We estimate our total reclamation liabilities based on permit requirements, engineering studies, and our engineering expertise related to these requirements. The estimate of ultimate reclamation liability is reviewed periodically by our management and engineers, and by government regulators. The estimated liability can change significantly if actual costs vary from our original assumptions or if government regulations change significantly. GAAP requires that asset retirement obligations be recorded as a liability based on fair value, which reflects the present value of the estimated future cash flows. In estimating future cash flows, we consider the estimated current cost of reclamation and apply inflation rates. The resulting estimated reclamation obligations could change significantly if actual amounts or the timing of these expenses change significantly from our assumptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Estimates of the quality and quantity of our coal reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in three dimensional structural modeling. Significant inaccuracies in interpretation or modeling could materially affect the estimated quantity and quality of our reserve which could adversely affect our results of operations.There are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of coal reserves. The process of coal volume estimation requires interpretations of drill hole log data and subsequent computer modeling of the intersected deposit. Significant inaccuracies in interpretation or modeling could materially affect the quantity and quality of our reserve estimates. The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of engineering and geological interpretation, conditions encountered during actual reserve recovery and undetected deposit anomalies. Variance from the assumptions used and drill hole modeling density could result in additions or deletions from our volume estimates. In addition, future environmental, economic or geologic changes may occur or become known that require reserve revisions either upward or downward from prior reserve estimates.Oil and GasEstimates of the quantity and value of our proved oil and gas reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves. Significant inaccuracies in interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves which could adversely affect our results of operations.There are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and their associated value. The process of estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves requires interpretation of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Significant inaccuracies in interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves. The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretations and judgment, and the assumptions used regarding quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves, future capital expenditures and prices for crude oil and natural gas. Actual prices, production, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves may vary from those assumed in our estimates. These variances may be significant. Any significant variance from the assumptions used could cause the actual quantity of our reserves, and future net cash flow, to be materially different from our estimates. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production, changes in future capital expenditures and fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices after the date of the estimate may result in substantial upward or downward revisions.53The potential adoption of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in restrictions which could increase costs and cause delays to the completion of certain oil and gas wells, and potentially preclude the economic drilling and completion of wells in certain reservoirs.Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry used extensively for decades to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. We routinely apply hydraulic fracturing techniques on our crude oil and natural gas properties. Hydraulic fracturing involves using mostly water, sand, and a small amount of certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to enhance flow of hydrocarbons into the well-bore. The process is typically regulated by state crude oil and natural gas commissions; however, the EPA does assert federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities when diesel comprises part of the fracturing fluid. In addition several agencies of the federal government including the EPA and the BLM are conducting studies of the fracturing stimulation process which may result in additional regulations. In 2012 the BLM has proposed regulations governing the use of hydraulic fracturing. In addition, legislation has been introduced before Congress, called the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act, to provide the federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process.Certain states have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure, and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. In the event federal, state, local or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where we are conducting or in the future plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply with such regulations that may be significant, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from utilizing fracture stimulation and effectively preclude the drilling of wells.Exploratory and development drilling are speculative activities that may not result in commercially productive reserves. Lack of drilling success could result in uneconomical investments and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Drilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered. There can be no assurance that new wells drilled by us or in which we have an interest will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment. Drilling for oil and gas may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells, but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain. Our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including economic conditions, mechanical problems, pressure or irregularities in formations, title problems, weather conditions, compliance with governmental rules and regulations and shortages in or delays in the delivery of equipment and services. Such equipment shortages and delays are caused by the high demand for rigs and other needed equipment by a large number of companies in active drilling basins. High activity in some basins may cause shortages of rigs and equipment in other basins. Our future drilling activities may not be successful. Lack of drilling success could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We could incur additional and substantial write-downs of the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties, which would cause a decrease in our assets and stockholders' equity and could adversely impact our results of operations.We review the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties under the full cost accounting rules of the SEC on a quarterly basis. This quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test. Under the ceiling test, capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects. In calculating future net revenues, SEC-defined commodity prices and recent costs are utilized. Such prices and costs are utilized except when different prices and costs are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts. Two primary factors in the ceiling test are natural gas and crude oil reserve quantities and SEC-defined crude oil and gas prices, both of which impact the present value of estimated future net revenues. Revisions to estimates of natural gas and crude oil reserves, or an increase or decrease in prices, can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues. Any excess of the net book value, less deferred income taxes, is generally written off as an expense.We recorded a non-cash impairment charge in the second quarter of 2012 due to the full cost ceiling limitations. We may have to record additional non-cash impairment charges in the future if commodity prices drive the SEC-defined prices below levels that precipitated the 2012 impairment. See Note 12 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.54FINANCING RISKSOur credit ratings could be lowered below investment grade in the future. If this were to occur, it could impact our access to capital, our cost of capital and our other operating costs.Our issuer credit rating is Baa3 (Positive outlook) by Moody’s; BBB- (Positive outlook) by S&P; and BBB- (Stable outlook) by Fitch. Reduction of our credit ratings could impair our ability to refinance or repay our existing debt and to complete new financings on acceptable terms, or at all. A downgrade could also result in counterparties requiring us to post additional collateral under existing or new contracts or trades. In addition, a ratings downgrade would increase our interest expense under some of our existing debt obligations, including borrowings under our credit facilities.Derivatives regulations included in current financial reform legislation could impede our ability to manage business and financial risks by restricting our use of derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates.In July 2010, Dodd-Frank was passed by Congress and signed into law. Dodd-Frank contains significant derivatives regulations, including a requirement that certain transactions be cleared resulting in a requirement to post cash collateral (commonly referred to as “margin”) for such transactions. Dodd-Frank provides for a potential exception from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end-users such as utilities and it includes a number of defined terms that will be used in determining how this exception applies to particular derivative transactions and the parties to those transactions. We use crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments for our hedging activities for our oil and gas production activities and our gas utility operations. We also use interest rate derivative instruments to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations. As a result of Dodd-Frank regulations promulgated by the CFTC, we may be required to post collateral to clearing entities for certain swap transactions we enter into. In addition, many of the transactions which were previously classified as swaps have been converted to exchange-traded futures contracts, which are subject to futures margin posting requirements.  Such a requirement could have a significant impact on our business by reducing our ability to execute derivative transactions to reduce commodity price and interest rate uncertainty and to protect cash flows. Requirements to post collateral may cause significant liquidity issues by reducing our ability to use cash for investment or other corporate purposes, or may require us to increase our level of debt. In addition, a requirement for our counterparties to post collateral could result in additional costs being passed on to us, thereby decreasing our profitability.Our hedging activities that are designed to protect against commodity price and financial market risks may cause fluctuations in reported financial results due to accounting requirements associated with such activities.We use various financial contracts and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps to manage commodity price and financial market risks. The timing of the recognition of gains or losses on these economic hedges in accordance with GAAP does not always match up with the gains or losses on the commodities or assets being hedged. The difference in accounting can result in volatility in reported results, even though the expected profit margin may be essentially unchanged from the dates the transactions were consummated.Our use of derivative financial instruments could result in material financial losses.From time to time, we have sought to limit a portion of the potential adverse effects resulting from changes in commodity prices and interest rates by using derivative financial instruments and other hedging mechanisms. To the extent that we hedge our commodity price and interest rate exposures, we forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in our favor. In addition, even though they are closely monitored by management, our hedging activities can result in losses. Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the hedge arrangement, the hedge is economically imperfect, commodity prices or interest rates move unfavorably related to our physical or financial positions, or hedging policies and procedures are not followed.55Market performance or changes in other assumptions could require us to make significant unplanned contributions to our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. Increasing costs associated with our defined benefit retirement plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.We have two defined benefit pension plans and three non-pension postretirement plans that cover certain eligible employees. Assumptions related to future costs, return on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on our funding requirements and the expense recognized related to these plans. These estimates and assumptions may change based on actual return on plan assets, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations.We rely on cash distributions from our subsidiaries to make and maintain dividends and debt payments. Our subsidiaries may not be allowed or may be unable to make dividend payments or loan funds to us, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations or pay dividends to our shareholders.We are a holding company. Our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets. Our operating cash flow and ability to service our indebtedness depend on the operating cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends or advances. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available for that purpose, whether by dividends or otherwise. In addition, each subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to us depends on any applicable contractual or regulatory restrictions that may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of cash, working capital or debt service funds.We expect to continue our policy of paying regular cash dividends. However, there is no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on our future earnings, capital requirements, and financial conditions, and are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Our operating subsidiaries have certain restrictions on their ability to transfer funds in the form of dividends or loans to us. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these restrictions and their impact on our liquidity.We may be unable to obtain the financing needed to refinance debt, fund planned capital expenditures or otherwise execute our operating strategy. Lack of credit at reasonable rates would have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.Our ability to execute our operating strategy is highly dependent upon our access to capital. Historically, we have addressed our liquidity needs (including funds required to make scheduled principal and interest payments, refinance debt and fund working capital and planned capital expenditures) with operating cash flow, borrowings under credit facilities, proceeds of debt and equity offerings and proceeds from asset sales. Our ability to access the capital markets and the costs and terms of available financing depend on many factors, including changes in our credit ratings, changes in the federal or state regulatory environment affecting energy companies, volatility in commodity or electricity prices and general economic and market conditions.In addition, given that we are a holding company and that our utility assets are owned by our subsidiaries, if we are unable to adequately access the credit markets, we could be required to take additional measures designed to ensure that our utility subsidiaries are adequately capitalized to provide safe and reliable service. Possible additional measures would be evaluated in the context of then-prevailing market conditions, prudent financial management and any applicable regulatory requirements.National and regional economic conditions may cause increased counterparty credit risk, late payments and uncollectible accounts, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.The continued recessionary environment and any future recession may lead to an increase in late payments from retail, commercial and industrial utility customers, as well as our non-utility customers. If late payments and uncollectible accounts increase, earnings and cash flows from our continuing operations may be reduced.56Our ability to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. Our insurance coverage may not provide protection against all significant losses.Our ability to obtain insurance, as well as the cost of such insurance, could be affected by developments affecting insurance businesses, international, national, state or local events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. Insurance coverage may not continue to be available at all, or at rates or on terms similar to those presently available to us. A loss for which we are not fully insured could materially and adversely affect our financial results. Our insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which the Company may be subject, including but not limited to environmental hazards, wildfire-related liability, risks associated with our oil and gas exploration and production activities, distribution property losses, cyber-security risks and dangers that exist in the gathering and transportation in pipelines.Our operations are also subject to all the hazards and risks normally incident to the development, exploitation, production and transportation of, and the exploration for, oil and gas, including unusual or unexpected geologic formations, pressures, down hole fires, mechanical failures, blowouts, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, gas or well fluids, pollution and other environmental risks. These hazards could result in substantial losses to us due to injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution and other environmental damage and suspension of operations. We maintain insurance coverage for our operated wells and we participate in insurance coverage maintained by the operators of our wells, although there can be no assurances that such coverage will be sufficient to prevent a material adverse effect to us if any of the foregoing events occur.Increasing costs associated with our health care plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.The costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees have increased substantially in recent years. We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs related to health care plans for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise. The increasing costs and funding requirements associated with our health care plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.In March 2010, the President of the United States signed PPACA as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “2010 Acts”). The 2010 Acts will have a substantial impact on health care providers, insurers, employers and individuals. The 2010 Acts will impact employers and businesses differently depending on the size of the organization and the specific impacts on a company’s employees. Certain provisions of the 2010 Acts are effective while other provisions of the 2010 Acts will be effective in future years. The 2010 Acts could require, among other things, changes to our current employee benefit plans and in our administrative and accounting processes, as well as changes to the cost of our plans. The ultimate extent and cost of these changes cannot be determined at this time and are being evaluated and updated as related regulations and interpretations of the 2010 Acts become available.Our electric and gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding. Within our utility rates we have generally recovered the cost of providing employee benefits. As benefit costs continue to rise, there can be no assurance that the state public utility commissions will allow recovery.We have deferred a substantial amount of income tax related to various tax planning strategies, including the deferral of a gain associated with the assets sold in the IPP Transaction. If the Internal Revenue Service successfully challenges these tax positions, our results of operations, financial position or liquidity could be adversely affected.We have deferred a substantial amount of tax payments through various tax planning strategies including the deferral of approximately $125 million in income taxes associated with the IPP Transaction and the Aquila Transaction.The IRS has challenged our position with respect to the like-kind exchange. As currently stated in a Notice of Proposed Adjustment received from the IRS in January 2013, their position is to disallow a significant portion of the gain deferred as reported on our originally filed 2008 tax return. We disagree with such a position and will pursue all available IRS and/or legal channels to challenge the proposed adjustment.  In the event we are unsuccessful in our challenge, the amount of deferred income tax on a worst case basis that could be accelerated into a current tax payable would be approximately $125 million. However, we would be entitled to a tax benefit associated with the additional tax depreciation that would result from increasing the depreciable cost for tax purposes in the assets acquired. This net current tax liability would accrue interest, which is estimated to be approximately $20 million before income tax effect.57In certain circumstances, the IRS may assess penalties when challenging our tax positions. If we were unsuccessful in defending against these penalties, it may have a material impact on our results of operations. No penalties have been assessed by the IRS in connection with the like-kind exchange transaction.Our ability to successfully resolve the purchase price adjustments in question from the sale of Enserco.On Feb. 29, 2012, we sold the outstanding stock of Enserco, our Energy Marketing segment. Pursuant to the provisions of the Stock Purchase Agreement, disputes regarding post-closing purchase price adjustments are subject to arbitration before a nationally-recognized accounting firm and all other disputes are subject to the indemnification procedures in the agreement.  The buyer originally demanded an amount totaling $7.2 million characterizing all claims in such demand as purchase price adjustments. We contested certain claims in the buyer's demand, including whether certain claims were properly characterized as purchase price adjustments, but reached a partial settlement and paid the buyer the sum of $1.4 million. The parties were unable to reach a negotiated agreement regarding the balance of the claims.  In December 2012, we agreed to arbitrate the claims that we believe are properly characterized as purchase price adjustments, but objected to the arbitration of the claims that we believe are not properly characterized as purchase price adjustments. After joint discussions of the parties with the arbitrator, in January 2013 the arbitrator advised the parties that it would not arbitrate the claims to which we objected. On Feb. 7, 2013, the buyer filed a petition in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado applying for an order compelling arbitration on all of the disputed claims. We will respond to this litigation, requesting the court to deny the buyer's application. An effective system of internal control may not be maintained, leading to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management to make an assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal controls. Our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of these controls. During their assessment of these controls, management or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify areas of weakness in control design or effectiveness, which may lead to the conclusion that a material weakness in internal control exists. Any control deficiencies we identify in the future could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis, which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports or have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business or access sources of liquidity.ENVIRONMENTAL RISKSFederal and state laws concerning greenhouse gas regulations and air emissions may materially increase our generation and production costs and could render some of our generating units uneconomical to operate and maintain.We own and operate regulated and non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants in South Dakota, Wyoming, and Colorado. Recent developments under federal and state laws and regulations governing air emissions from fossil-fuel generating plants will likely result in more stringent emission limitations, which could have a material impact on our costs of operations. Various pending or final state and EPA regulations that will impact our facilities are also discussed in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption “Environmental Matters.”On May 20, 2011, with amendments on Dec. 21, 2012, the EPA’s Industrial and Commercial Boiler regulations became effective, which provide for hazardous air pollutant-related emission limits and monitoring requirements. The compliance deadline for this rule is March 21, 2014. Engineering evaluations have been completed and confirm the significant impact on our Neil Simpson I, Osage and Ben French facilities. We anticipate these units will be retired on or before March 21, 2014 compliance deadline. On Dec. 16, 2011, with updates on Dec. 21, 2012, the EPA signed the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from Coal and Oil Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units (MATS), which became effective on April 16, 2012. Affected units have three years from the rule effective date to be in compliance, with a pathway defined to apply for a one year extension due to certain circumstances. It is expected that all of our plants will be in compliance by the initial 2015 deadline, with the primary impacts to Neil Simpson II, Wygen I, Wygen II, Wygen III and the Wyodak Plant with the need to install mercury sorbent injection systems and the need to meet additional monitoring and testing.58The GHG Tailoring Rule, implementing regulations of GHG for permitting purposes, became effective in June 2010. This rule will impact us in the event of a major modification at an existing facility or in the event of a new major source as defined by EPA regulations. Existing permitted facilities will see monitoring reporting requirements incorporated into their operating permits upon renewal. New projects or major modifications to existing projects will result in a Best Available Control Technology review that could result in more stringent emissions control practices and technologies. The EPA’s GHG New Source Performance Standard for new steam electric generating units is expected to be final in the first half of 2013 and as proposed, effectively prohibits new coal fired units until carbon capture and sequestration becomes technically and economically feasible.  In 2013, we expect to see a proposed rule from the EPA, to regulate GHG emissions from existing steam electric generating units.  This rule could have a significant impact on our coal generating fleet.In 2010, the State of Colorado enacted House Bill 1365, the Colorado Clean Air, Clean Jobs Act, a coordinated utility plan to reduce air emissions from coal fired power plants and promoting the use of natural gas and other lower emitting resources. This act has a significant impact on our W.N. Clark facility and in October 2010, Colorado Electric filed testimony with the CPUC that recommended retirement of the W.N. Clark facility to comply with House Bill 1365. In December 2010, the CPUC issued an order approving the closure of the W.N. Clark generation facility by Dec. 31, 2013, and granted a presumption of need for replacement of the plant. On July 30, 2012, Colorado Electric filed its electric resource plan with the CPUC seeking to develop and own replacement capacity for the retirement of the coal-fired W.N. Clark power plant. The CPUC dismissed the initial filing without prejudice. It directed Colorado Electric to refile the resource plan and address alternatives for not just the replacement capacity for its coal-fired W.N. Clark power plant, but also for the retirement of the aging natural gas-fired steam turbines at Pueblo Units 5 and 6. On review, the CPUC confirmed Colorado Electric’s right to own the replacement capacity for the W.N. Clark power plant and extended the date to refile the resource plan to May 1, 2013.Due to uncertainty as to the final outcome of federal climate change legislation, or regulatory changes under the Clean Air Act, we cannot definitively estimate the effect of GHG legislation or regulation on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The impact of GHG legislation or regulation on our company will depend upon many factors, including but not limited to the timing of implementation, the GHG sources that are regulated, the overall GHG emissions cap level, and the availability of technologies to control or reduce GHG emissions. If a “cap and trade” structure is implemented, the impact will depend on the degree to which offsets are allowed, the allocation of emission allowances to specific sources, and the effect of carbon regulation on natural gas and coal prices.New or more stringent regulations or other energy efficiency requirements could require us to incur significant additional costs relating to, among other things, the installation of additional emission control equipment, the acceleration of capital expenditures, the purchase of additional emissions allowances or offsets, the acquisition or development of additional energy supply from renewable resources, and the closure of certain generating facilities. To the extent our regulated fossil-fuel generating plants are included in rate base; we will attempt to recover costs associated with complying with emission standards or other requirements. We will also attempt to recover the emission compliance costs of our non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants from utility and other purchasers of the power generated by those non-regulated power plants. Any unrecovered costs could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, future changes in environmental regulations governing air emissions could render some of our power generating units more expensive or uneconomical to operate and maintain.The failure to achieve or maintain compliance with existing or future governmental laws, regulations or requirements could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Additionally, the potentially high cost of complying with such requirements or addressing environmental liabilities could also adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.Our business is subject to extensive energy, environmental and other laws and regulations of federal, state, tribal and local authorities. We generally must obtain and comply with a variety of regulations, licenses, permits and other approvals in order to operate, which can require significant capital expenditure and operating costs. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to civil or criminal liability and the imposition of penalties, liens or fines, claims for property damage or personal injury, or environmental clean-up costs. In addition, existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted, and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities, which could require additional unexpected expenditures or cause us to reevaluate the feasibility of continued operations at certain sites, and have a detrimental effect on our business.59In connection with certain acquisitions, we assumed liabilities associated with the environmental condition of certain properties, regardless of when such liabilities arose, whether known or unknown, and in some cases agreed to indemnify the former owners of those properties for environmental liabilities. Future steps to bring our facilities into compliance or to address contamination from legacy operations, if necessary, could be expensive and could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition. We expect our environmental compliance expenditures to be substantial in the future due to the continuing trends toward stricter standards, greater regulation, more extensive permitting requirements and an increase in the number of assets we operate.The characteristics of coal may make it difficult for coal users to comply with various environmental standards related to coal combustion or utilization and the use of alternative energy sources for power generation as mandated by states could reduce coal consumption. As a result, coal users may switch to other fuels, which could affect the volume of our sales and the price of our products.Coal contains impurities, including but not limited to sulfur, mercury, chlorine, carbon and other elements or compounds, many of which are released into the air when coal is burned. More stringent environmental regulations of emissions from coal-fueled power plants could increase the costs of using coal, thereby reducing demand for coal as a fuel source and the volume and price of our coal sales. Renewable energy requirements and changes to regulations could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative in the planning and building of power plants in the future.Proposed reductions in emissions of mercury, sulfur dioxides, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, or greenhouse gases may require the installation of costly emission control technology or the implementation of other measures. For example, in order to meet the federal Clean Air Act limits for SO2 emission from power plants, coal users may need to install scrubbers, use SO2 emission allowances (some of which they may purchase), blend high-sulfur coal with low-sulfur coal or switch to other fuels. Reductions in mercury emission required by certain states and the EPA will likely require some power plants to install new equipment, at substantial cost, or discourage the use of certain coals containing higher levels of mercury. Existing or proposed legislation focusing on emissions enacted by the United States or individual states could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative for our customers and could impose a tax or fee on the producer of the coal. If our customers decrease the volume of coal they purchase from us or switch to alternative fuels as a result of existing or future environmental regulations aimed at reducing emissions, our operations and financial results could be adversely impacted"
11,BKH,BLACK HILLS CORP,2012-02-29,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSThe nature of our business subjects us to a number of uncertainties and risks. The following risk factors and other risk factors that we discuss in our periodic reports filed with the SEC should be considered for a better understanding of our Company. These important factors and other matters discussed herein could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking statements, or otherwise.Regulatory commissions may refuse to approve some or all of the utility rate increases we have requested or may request in the future, or may determine that amounts passed through to customers were not prudently incurred and therefore, are not recoverable which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.Our regulated electric and gas utility operations are subject to cost-of-service regulation and earnings oversight from federal and state utility commissions. This regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of desired earnings levels. Our retail electric and gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding. The rates that we are allowed to charge may or may not match our related costs and allowed return on invested capital at any given time. While rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that the state public utility commissions will judge all of our costs, including our borrowing and debt service costs, to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that produce a full recovery of our costs and the return on invested capital allowed by the applicable state public utility commission.To some degree, each of our gas and electric utilities in South Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, Iowa and Kansas are permitted to recover certain costs (such as increased fuel and purchased power costs) without having to file a rate case. To the extent we are able to pass through such costs to our customers and a state public utility commission subsequently determines that such costs should not have been paid by the customers, we may be required to refund such costs. Any such costs not recovered through rates, or any such refund, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.The sale of Enserco may be delayed or not be completed, which could adversely affect our results of operations.  The operating results of Enserco between year-end and completion of the sale may be negatively impacted by the announcement of the sale and/or other risks inherent to that business, and the sale of Enserco may be delayed or not be completed, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.In January 2012, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Enserco, our non-regulated Energy Marketing segment.  We expect the sale to close in the first quarter of 2012.  We will continue to operate the Enserco business until the sale is completed.  This business is subject to a variety of risks inherent to trading activities, including:•Commodity prices can often be volatile.  A decline in oil and natural gas price volatility could affect our revenues and returns from our trading activities at Enserco, which tend to increase when markets are volatile.•Derivative instruments are used in conjunction with our trading activities to limit a portion of the potential adverse effects resulting from changes in commodity prices and foreign exchange rates.  Even though they are closely monitored by Management, our hedging and trading activities can result in losses. Depending upon regulations adopted by the CFTC, we could be required to post additional collateral with our dealer counterparties for our commitments.  Such a requirement could have a significant impact on our ability to execute derivative transactions and on cash flow. •The operations of Enserco rely on storage and transportation assets owned by third parties to satisfy their obligations.  We depend on pipelines and other storage and transportation facilities owned by third parties to satisfy our delivery obligations under contracts to buy and sell natural gas, crude oil, coal and other commodities, which are settled by physical delivery.•Enserco may be subject to increased regulation, which may limit position limits and opportunity for various transactions.53•The global financial situation has affected our counterparty credit risk, and as a consequence the creditworthiness of many of our contractual counterparties (particularly financial institutions) has deteriorated.  Additionally, economic conditions may cause increased late payments and uncollectible accounts.  Even though we have established guidelines, controls and limits to manage and mitigate credit risk and this is monitored closely by management, to the extent economic conditions cause our credit exposure to contractual counterparties to increase materially, such increased exposure could have a material adverse effect on Energy Marketing's results of operations, liquidity and financial position.We will not be able to complete the sale of Enserco until we obtain regulatory approval from FERC.  If this regulatory approval is not received, then the parties will not be obligated to complete the transaction.  In addition, the sale is subject to customary conditions and the transaction may not be completed if a portion of the business suffers a material adverse effect between the signing of the stock purchase agreement and the closing.  The value placed on Enserco is based on the value of its trading activities and the value of its midstream assets.  As agreed to in the stock purchase agreement, we have committed to certain business curtailment actions relating to our proprietary trading and certain working capital requirements.  Uncertainty about the effect of the sale on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on us, regardless of whether the transaction is eventually completed.  Although we have taken steps to reduce any adverse effects, these uncertainties may impair our ability to retain employees and customers and others who deal with us may seek to change existing business relationships. Although actual results could differ materially from our expectations, after closing costs and other adjustments, we do not anticipate the transaction to result in a significant gain or loss.  However, this expectation could change due to several factors including, but not limited to, changes in the market value of natural gas inventory and certain other contracts and changes in the estimate of transaction costs and other costs associated with closing out Enserco Energy's operations.  We have deferred a substantial amount of income tax related to various tax planning strategies, including the deferral of a gain associated with the assets sold in the IPP Transaction. If the Internal Revenue Service successfully challenges these tax positions, our results of operations, financial position or liquidity could be adversely affected.We have deferred a substantial amount of tax payments through various tax planning strategies, including the deferral of approximately $125 million in taxes associated with the IPP Transaction and the Aquila Transaction.  We had previously deferred approximately $185 million in taxes associated with the IPP Transaction and the Aquila Transaction.  In the third quarter of 2010, we reached an agreement with the Appeals Division of the IRS that resulted in a decrease in the amount of such deferral from $185 million to $125 million. The decrease represents the downward adjustment to tax depreciation allowed on certain assets sold, which resulted in a decrease to the gain realized on the sale of those assets and ultimately a decrease in deferred taxes. The remaining $125 million in deferred taxes relating to the IPP Transaction and the Aquila Transaction continues to be subject to IRS review.We cannot be certain that the IRS will accept our tax positions.  If the IRS successfully sought to assert contrary tax positions, we could be required to pay a significant amount of these deferred taxes earlier than currently forecasted.  In certain circumstances, the IRS may assess penalties when challenging our tax positions.  If we were unsuccessful in defending against these penalties, it may have a material impact on our results of operations. We could incur additional and substantial write-downs of the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties, which would adversely impact our results of operations.We review the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties under the full cost accounting rules of the SEC on a quarterly basis. This quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test. Under the ceiling test, capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects. In calculating future net revenues, SEC-defined commodity prices and recent costs are utilized. Such prices and costs are utilized except when different prices and costs are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts. Two primary factors in the ceiling test are natural gas and crude oil reserve levels and SEC-defined crude oil and gas prices, both of which impact the present value of estimated future net revenues. Revisions to estimates of natural gas and crude oil reserves, or an increase or decrease in prices, can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues. Any excess of the net book value, less deferred income taxes, is generally written off as an expense.54We recorded a non-cash impairment charge in the first quarter of 2009 due to the full cost ceiling limitations. We may have to record additional non-cash impairment charges in the future if commodity prices drive the SEC-defined prices below levels that precipitated the 2009 impairment. Using our year-end reserve information, a price sensitivity analysis indicates that there is a risk of a ceiling test impairment if the average realized gas price drops below $2.80 per Mcf, holding all other variables constant.  See Note 12 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Estimates of the quantity and value of our proved oil and gas reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves.  Significant inaccuracies in interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves which could adversely affect our results of operations.There are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and their values. The process of estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves requires interpretation of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Significant inaccuracies in interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves. The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretations and judgment, and the assumptions used regarding quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves, future capital expenditures and prices for crude oil and natural gas. Actual prices, production, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves may vary from those assumed in our estimates. These variances may be significant. Any significant variance from the assumptions used could cause the actual quantity of our reserves, and future net cash flow, to be materially different from our estimates. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production, changes in future capital expenditures and fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices after the date of the estimate may result in substantial upward or downward revisions. Estimates of the quality and quantity of our coal reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in three dimensional structural modeling.  Significant inaccuracies in interpretation or modeling could materially affect the estimated quantity and quality of our reserve which could adversely affect our results of operations.There are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of coal reserves. The process of coal volume estimation requires interpretations of drill hole log data and subsequent computer modeling of the intersected deposit. Significant inaccuracies in interpretation or modeling could materially affect the quantity and quality of our reserve estimates. The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of engineering and geological interpretation, conditions encountered during actual reserve recovery and undetected deposit anomalies. Variance from the assumptions used and drill hole modeling density could result in additions or deletions from our volume estimates. In addition, future environmental, economic or geologic changes may occur or become known that require reserve revisions either upward or downward from prior reserve estimates.The potential adoption of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in restrictions which could increase costs and cause delays to the completion of certain oil and gas wells, and potentially preclude the economic drilling and completion of wells in certain reservoirs.Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations.  We routinely apply hydraulic fracturing techniques on our crude oil and natural gas properties.  Hydraulic fracturing involves using mostly water, sand, and a small amount of certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to enhance flow of hydrocarbons into the well-bore. The process is typically regulated by state crude oil and natural gas commissions; however, the EPA does assert federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities when diesel comprises part of the fracturing fluid.  In addition several agencies of the federal government including the EPA and the BLM are conducting studies of the fracturing stimulation process which may result in additional regulations.   In addition, legislation has been introduced before Congress, called the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act, to provide the federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process.  Certain states have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure, and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether.  In the event federal, state, local or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where we are conducting or in the future plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply with such regulations that may be significant, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from utilizing fracture stimulation and effectively preclude the drilling of wells.55Municipal governments may seek to limit or deny franchise privileges which could inhibit our ability to secure adequate recovery of our investment in assets subject to condemnation.Municipal governments within our utility service territories possess the power of condemnation and could establish a municipal utility within a portion of our current service territories by limiting or denying franchise privileges for our operations, and exercising powers of condemnation over all or part of our utility assets within municipal boundaries. Although condemnation is a process that is subject to constitutional protections requiring just compensation, as with any judicial procedure, the outcome is uncertain. If a municipality sought to pursue this course of action, we cannot assure that we would secure adequate recovery of our investment in assets subject to condemnation.Our current or future development, expansion and acquisition activities may not be successful, which could impair our ability to execute our growth strategy.Execution of our future growth plan is dependent on successful ongoing and future development, expansion and acquisition activities. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to complete development projects or acquisitions we undertake or continue to develop attractive opportunities for growth. Factors that could cause our activities to be unsuccessful include:•Our inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals;•Our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all;•The possibility that one or more credit rating agencies would downgrade our issuer credit rating to below investment grade, thus increasing our cost of doing business;•Our inability to successfully integrate any businesses we acquire;•Our inability to retain management or other key personnel;•Our inability to negotiate acceptable acquisition, construction, fuel supply, power sales or other material agreements;•The trend of utilities building their own generation or looking for developers to develop and build projects for sale to utilities under turnkey arrangements;•Lower than anticipated increases in the demand for utility services in our target markets;•Changes in federal, state, local or tribal laws and regulations, particularly those which would make it more difficult or costly to fully develop our coal reserves, our oil and gas reserves and our generation capacity;•Fuel prices or fuel supply constraints;•Pipeline capacity and transmission constraints; and•Competition.We can provide no assurance that results from any acquisition will conform to our expectations. There may be additional risks associated with the operation of any newly acquired assets or businesses.Acquisitions are subject to a number of uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Factors which may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected results include:•Delay in, and restrictions imposed as part of, any required governmental or regulatory approvals;•The loss of management or other key personnel;•The diversion of our management's attention from other business segments; and•Integration and operational issues.56Construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve significant risks which could reduce revenues or increase expenses.The construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve many risks, including:•The inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals along with the cost of complying with or satisfying conditions imposed upon such approvals;•Contractual restrictions upon the timing of scheduled outages;•Cost of supplying or securing replacement power during scheduled and unscheduled outages;•The unavailability or increased cost of equipment;•The cost of recruiting and retaining or the unavailability of skilled labor;•Supply interruptions, work stoppages and labor disputes;•Capital and operating costs to comply with increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations;•Opposition by members of public or special-interest groups; •Weather interferences; •Unexpected engineering, environmental and geological problems; and•Unanticipated cost overruns.The ongoing operation of our facilities involves many of the risks described above, in addition to risks relating to the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency. New plants may employ recently developed and technologically complex equipment, including newer environmental emission control technology. Any of these risks could cause us to operate below expected capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues, increase expenses or cause us to incur higher maintenance costs and penalties. While we maintain insurance, obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance and our rights under warranties or performance guarantees may not be timely or adequate to cover lost revenues, increased expenses or liquidated damage payments.Operating results can be adversely affected by variations from normal weather conditions.Our utility businesses are seasonal businesses, and weather patterns can have a material impact on our operating performance. Demand for electricity is typically greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating. Because natural gas is primarily used for residential and commercial heating, the demand for this product depends heavily upon winter weather patterns throughout our service territory and a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating seasons. Accordingly, our utility operations have historically generated lower revenues and income when weather conditions are cooler than normal in the summer and warmer than normal in the winter. Unusually mild summers and winters therefore could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our coal mining operations are subject to operating risks that are beyond our control which could affect our profitability and production levels.  Our surface mining operations could be disrupted or materially affected due to adverse weather or natural disasters such as heavy snow, rain or flooding. 57Prices for some of our products and services as well as a portion of our operating costs are volatile and may cause our revenues and expenses to fluctuate significantly.A portion of our net income is attributable to sales of contract and off-system wholesale electricity and natural gas into a robust market. Energy prices are influenced by many factors outside our control, including, among other things, fuel prices, transmission constraints, supply and demand, weather, general economic conditions, and the rules, regulations and actions of system operators in those markets. Moreover, unlike most other commodities, electricity cannot be stored and therefore must be produced concurrently with its use. As a result, wholesale power markets are subject to significant, unpredictable price fluctuations over relatively short periods of time.The success of our crude oil and natural gas operations is affected by the prevailing market prices of crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices and markets historically have also been, and are likely to continue to be, volatile. A decrease in crude oil or natural gas prices would not only reduce revenues and profits, but would also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable, and may result in charges to earnings for impairment of the net capitalized cost of these assets. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for crude oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. The proliferation of domestic natural gas shale plays in recent years has provided the market with an abundant new supply of natural gas.  Combined with lower demand from the economic downturn, this new and abundant supply source has created record volumes of natural gas in storage, and reduced domestic natural gas prices.  In fact, the ratio of crude oil to natural gas prices is at an all-time high, far in excess of the six to one heating value equivalent ratio.  This trend is likely to continue for the foreseeable future given the expected further development of domestic shale gas reserves.Our mining operation requires reliable supplies of replacement parts, explosives, fuel, tires and steel-related products.  If the cost of these increase significantly, or if sources of supplies and mining equipment become unavailable to meet our replacement demands, our productivity and profitability could be lower than our current expectations. In recent years, industry-wide demand growth exceeded supply growth for certain surface mining equipment and off-the-road tires. As a result, lead times for procuring some items generally increased to several months and prices for these items increased significantly.Our hedging activities that are designed to protect against commodity price and financial market risks may cause fluctuations in reported financial results due to accounting requirements associated with such activities.We use various financial contracts and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, to manage commodity price and financial market risks. The timing of the recognition of gains or losses on these economic hedges in accordance with GAAP does not always match up with the gains or losses on the commodities or assets being hedged. The difference in accounting can result in volatility in reported results, even though the expected profit margin may be essentially unchanged from the dates the transactions were consummated.Derivatives regulations included in current financial reform legislation could impede our ability to manage business and financial risks by restricting our use of derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates. In July 2010, Dodd-Frank was passed by Congress and signed into law.  Dodd-Frank contains significant derivatives regulations, including a requirement that certain transactions be cleared on exchanges and a requirement to post cash collateral (commonly referred to as ""margin"") for such transactions. Dodd-Frank provides for a potential exception from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end-users and it includes a number of defined terms that will be used in determining how this exception applies to particular derivative transactions and the parties to those transactions. Dodd-Frank requires the CFTC to promulgate rules to define these terms.  However, CFTC has not yet done so and we do not know whether the rules or exceptions thereto will apply to us. We use crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments to hedge the sales price for a portion of our expected oil and gas production. We also use interest rate derivative instruments to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations. Depending on the regulations adopted by the CFTC, we could be required to post additional collateral with our dealer counterparties for our commitments and interest rate derivative transactions. Such a requirement could have a significant impact on our business by reducing our ability to execute derivative transactions to reduce commodity price and interest rate uncertainty and to protect cash flows. Requirements to post collateral may cause significant liquidity issues by reducing our ability to use cash for investment or other corporate purposes, or may require us to increase our level of debt. In addition, a requirement for our counterparties to post collateral could result in additional costs being passed on to us, thereby decreasing our profitability.58Our use of derivative financial instruments could result in material financial losses.From time to time, we have sought to limit a portion of the potential adverse effects resulting from changes in commodity prices and interest rates by using derivative financial instruments and other hedging mechanisms. To the extent that we hedge our commodity price and interest rate exposures, we forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in our favor. In addition, even though they are closely monitored by management, our hedging activities can result in losses. Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the hedge arrangement, the hedge is economically imperfect, commodity prices or interest rates move unfavorably related to our physical or financial positions, or hedging policies and procedures are not followed.Our operations rely on storage and transportation assets owned by third parties to satisfy their obligations.   If storage capacity is inadequate or transportation is disrupted, our ability to satisfy our obligations may be hindered.Our Utilities Group and Power Generation segment relies on pipeline companies and other owners of gas storage facilities to deliver natural gas to ratepayers, to supply our natural gas-fired plants and to hedge commodity costs. If storage capacity is inadequate or transportation is disrupted, our ability to satisfy our obligations may be hindered. As a result, we may be responsible for damages incurred by our counterparties, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at then-current market rates, or for penalties imposed by state regulatory authorities.The failure to achieve or maintain compliance with existing or future governmental regulations or requirements could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.  Additionally, the potentially high cost of complying with such requirements or addressing environmental liabilities could also adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.Our business is subject to extensive energy, environmental and other laws and regulations of federal, state, tribal and local authorities.  We generally must obtain and comply with a variety of regulations, licenses, permits and other approvals in order to operate, which can require significant capital expenditure and operating costs.  If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to civil or criminal liability and the imposition of penalties, liens or fines, claims for property damage or personal injury, or environmental clean-up costs.  In addition, existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted, and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities, which could require additional unexpected expenditures or cause us to reevaluate the feasibility of continued operations at certain sites, and have a detrimental effect on our business.In connection with certain acquisitions, we assumed liabilities associated with the environmental condition of certain properties, regardless of when such liabilities arose, whether known or unknown, and in some cases agreed to indemnify the former owners of those properties for environmental liabilities.  Future steps to bring our facilities into compliance or to address contamination from legacy operations, if necessary, could be expensive and could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.  We expect our environmental compliance expenditures to be substantial in the future due to the continuing trends toward stricter standards, greater regulation, more extensive permitting requirements and an increase in the number of assets we operate.Our financial performance depends on the successful operations of our facilities.  If the risks involved in our operations are not appropriately managed or mitigated, our operations may not be successful and this could adversely affect our results of operations.Operating electric generating facilities, oil and gas properties, the coal mine and electric and natural gas distribution systems involves risks, including:•Operational limitations imposed by environmental and other regulatory requirements.•Interruptions to supply of fuel and other commodities used in generation and distribution. The Utilities Group purchases fuel from a number of suppliers. Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the delivery of fuel due to various factors, including but not limited to, transportation delays, labor relations, weather, and environmental regulations, which could limit the Utilities' ability to operate their facilities.•Breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, including those operated by PacifiCorp at the Wyodak plant.•Inability to recruit and retain skilled technical labor.59•Labor relations. Approximately 33% of our employees are represented by a total of six collective bargaining agreements.  •Disrupted transmission and distribution. We depend on transmission and distribution facilities, including those operated by unaffiliated parties, to deliver the electricity and gas that we sell to our retail and wholesale customers. If transmission is interrupted, our ability to sell or deliver product and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered.•Operating hazards such as leaks, mechanical problems and accidents, including explosions, affecting our natural gas distribution system which could impact public safety, reliability and customer confidence. Exploratory and development drilling are speculative activities that may not result in commercially productive reserves.   Lack of drilling success could result in uneconomical investments and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Drilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered.  There can be no assurance that new wells drilled by us or in which we have an interest will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment.  Drilling for oil and gas may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells, but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs.  The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain.  Our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including economic conditions, mechanical problems, pressure or irregularities in formations, title problems, weather conditions, compliance with governmental rules and regulations and shortages in or delays in the delivery of equipment and services.  Such equipment shortages and delays are caused by the high demand for rigs and other needed equipment by a large number of companies in active drilling basins.  High activity in some basins may cause shortages of rigs and equipment in other basins.  Our future drilling activities may not be successful. Lack of drilling success could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our operations are also subject to all the hazards and risks normally incident to the development, exploitation, production and transportation of, and the exploration for, oil and gas, including unusual or unexpected geologic formations, pressures, down hole fires, mechanical failures, blowouts, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, gas or well fluids and pollution and other environmental risks.  These hazards could result in substantial losses to us due to injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution and other environmental damage and suspension of operations.  We maintain insurance coverage for our operated wells and we participate in insurance coverage maintained by the operators of our wells, although there can be no assurances that such coverage will be sufficient to prevent a material adverse effect to us if any of the foregoing events occur.Threats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism, cyber-attacks, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt our businesses, or the businesses of third parties, may impact our operations in unpredictable ways and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity. •We are subject to the potentially adverse operating and financial effects of terrorist acts and threats, as well as cyber-attacks and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups.  Our generation, transmission and distribution facilities, fuel storage facilities, information technology systems and other infrastructure facilities and systems and physical assets, could be direct targets of, or indirectly affected by, such activities.  Terrorist acts or other similar events could harm our businesses by limiting their ability to generate, purchase or transmit power and by delaying their development and construction of new generating facilities and capital improvements to existing facilities.  These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair and insure our assets, and could adversely affect our operations by contributing to disruption of supplies and markets for natural gas, oil and other fuels.  They could also impair our ability to raise capital by contributing to financial instability and lower economic activity. •We operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure.  Despite our implementation of security measures, all of our technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access, including cyber-attacks.  If our technology systems were to fail or be breached and be unable to recover in a timely way, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive confidential and other data could be compromised, which could have material adverse effect on our financial results.  60•The implementation of security guidelines and measures and maintenance of insurance, to the extent available, addressing such activities could increase costs.  These types of events could materially adversely affect our financial results.  In addition, these types of events could require significant management attention and resources, and could adversely affect our reputation among customers and the public.  •A disruption of the regional electric transmission grid, natural gas pipeline infrastructure or other fuel sources, could negatively impact our business. Because generation, transmission systems and natural gas pipelines are part of an interconnected system, we face the risk of possible loss of business due to a disruption caused by the impact of an event on the interconnected system (such as severe weather or a generator or transmission facility outage, pipeline rupture, or a sudden significant increase or decrease in wind generation) within our system or within a neighboring system. Any such disruption could have a material impact on our financial results. Our ability to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers.  Our insurance coverage may not provide protection against all significant losses.  Our ability to obtain insurance, as well as the cost of coverage of such insurance, could be affected by developments affecting their businesses, as well as international, national, state or local events, as well as the financial condition of insurers.  Insurance coverage may not continue to be available at all, or at rates or on terms similar to those presently available to us.  A loss for which we are not fully insured could materially and adversely affect our financial results.  Our insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which the company may be subject, including but not limited to environmental hazards, risks associated with our oil and gas exploration and production activities, and dangers that exist in the gathering and transportation in pipelines.Federal and state laws concerning greenhouse gas regulations and air emissions may materially increase our generation and production costs and could render some of our generating units uneconomical to operate and maintain.We own and operate regulated and non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants in South Dakota, Wyoming, and Colorado.  Recent developments under federal and state laws and regulations governing air emissions from fossil-fuel generating plants will likely result in more stringent emission limitations, which could have a material impact on our costs or operations. Various pending or final state and EPA regulations that will impact our facilities are also discussed in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption ""Environmental Matters."" On May 20, 2011, the EPA's Industrial and Commercial Boiler regulations became effective, which provide for hazardous air pollutant-related emission limits and monitoring requirements. The compliance deadline for this rule is March 21, 2014.  Engineering evaluations have been completed and confirm the significant impact on our Neil Simpson I, Osage and Ben French facilities.  We anticipate these units will be closed prior to the March 21, 2014 compliance deadline. On December 16, 2011, the EPA signed the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from Coal and Oil Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units, which became effective on February 16, 2012.  Affected units will have three years from the rule effective date to be in compliance, with a pathway defined to apply for a one year extension due to certain circumstances.  Certain requirements of that regulation could have significant impacts on the Neil Simpson II, Wygen I, Wygen II, Wygen III and Wyodak plants.  The GHG Tailoring Rule, implementing regulations of GHG for permitting purposes, became effective in June 2010. This rule will impact us in the event of a major modification at an existing facility or in the event of a new major source as defined by EPA regulations. Existing permitted facilities will see monitoring reporting requirements incorporated into their operating permits upon renewal. New projects or major modifications to existing projects will result in a Best Available Control Technology review that could result in more stringent emissions control practices and technologies. 61In 2010, the State of Colorado enacted House Bill 1365, the Colorado Clean Air, Clean Jobs Act, a coordinated utility plan to reduce air emissions from coal fired power plants and promoting the use of natural gas and other lower emitting resources. This act has a significant impact on our W.N. Clark facility and in October 2010, Colorado Electric filed testimony with the CPUC that recommended retirement of the W.N. Clark facility to comply with House Bill 1365 within three years of promulgation of the EPA's proposed Industrial and Commercial Boiler Hazardous Air Pollutant Regulations, or in the absence of such regulation, to retire the units by the end of 2017. In December 2010, the CPUC issued an order approving the closure of the W.N. Clark generation facility by December 31, 2013, and granted a presumption of need for replacement of the plant. Colorado Electric proposed to construct a third 88 MW natural gas-fired turbine at its Pueblo Airport Generation Station.  Colorado Electric filed a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity in the first quarter of 2011 that provided for additional justification for the incremental 46 MW generation capacity.  On December 14, 2011 an administrative law judge issued a recommendation to deny the CPCN.  Subsequently Colorado Electric submitted an exception filing on which a ruling from the CPUC is expected by mid-2012.   Due to uncertainty as to the final outcome of federal climate change legislation, or regulatory changes under the Clean Air Act, we cannot definitively estimate the effect of GHG regulation on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The impact of GHG legislation or regulation on our company will depend upon many factors, including but not limited to the timing of implementation, the GHG sources that are regulated, the overall GHG emissions cap level, and the availability of technologies to control or reduce GHG emissions. If a ""cap and trade"" structure is implemented, the impact will depend on the degree to which offsets are allowed, the allocation of emission allowances to specific sources, and the effect of carbon regulation on natural gas and coal prices.New or more stringent regulations or other energy efficiency requirements could require us to incur significant additional costs relating to, among other things, the installation of additional emission control equipment, the acceleration of capital expenditures, the purchase of additional emissions allowances or offsets, the acquisition or development of additional energy supply from renewable resources, and the closure of certain generating facilities. To the extent our regulated fossil-fuel generating plants are included in rate base; we will attempt to recover costs associated with complying with emission standards or other requirements. We will also attempt to recover the emission compliance costs of our non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants from utility and other purchasers of the power generated by those non-regulated power plants. Any unrecovered costs could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, future changes in environmental regulations governing air emissions could render some of our power generating units more expensive or uneconomical to operate and maintain.The characteristics of coal may make it difficult for coal users to comply with various environmental standards related to coal combustion or utilization.  As a result, coal users may switch to other fuels, which could affect the volume of our sales and the price of our products.Coal contains impurities, including but not limited to sulfur, mercury, chlorine, carbon and other elements or compounds, many of which are released into the air when coal is burned. More stringent environmental regulations of emissions from coal-fueled power plants could increase the costs of using coal, thereby reducing demand for coal as a fuel source and the volume and price of our coal sales. Changes to regulations could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative in the planning and building of power plants in the future.Proposed reductions in emissions of mercury, sulfur dioxides, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, or greenhouse gases may require the installation of costly emission control technology or the implementation of other measures. For example, in order to meet the federal Clean Air Act limits for SO2 emission from power plants, coal users may need to install scrubbers, use SO2 emission allowances (some of which they may purchase), blend high-sulfur coal with low-sulfur coal or switch to other fuels. Reductions in mercury emission required by certain states will likely require some power plants to install new equipment, at substantial cost, or discourage the use of certain coals containing higher levels of mercury.  Existing or proposed legislation focusing on emissions enacted by the United States or individual states could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative for our customers and could impose a tax or fee on the producer of the coal. If our customers decrease the volume of coal they purchase from us or switch to alternative fuels as a result of existing or future environmental regulations aimed at reducing emissions, our operations and financial results could be adversely impacted.62If the assumptions underlying our reclamation and mine closure obligations are materially inaccurate, our costs could be significantly greater than anticipated or be incurred sooner than anticipated.  Our mining consists of surface mining operations.  The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and counterparty state laws and regulation established operations, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining.  We estimate our total reclamation liabilities based on permit requirements, engineering studies, and our engineering expertise related to these requirements.  The estimate of ultimate reclamation liability is reviewed periodically by our management and engineers, and by government regulators.  The estimated liability can change significantly if actual costs vary from our original assumptions or if government regulations change significantly.  GAAP requires that asset retirement obligations be recorded as a liability based on fair value, which reflects the present value of the estimated future cash flows.  In estimating future cash flows, we consider the estimated current cost of reclamation and apply inflation rates.  The resulting estimate reclamation obligations could change significantly if actual amounts or the timing of these expenses change significantly from our assumptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  Our energy production, transmission and distribution activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other catastrophic events.  These events could result in impairment of our operations, additional costs and substantial loss to us.Inherent in our natural gas distribution activities, as well as our production, transportation and storage of crude oil and natural gas and our coal mining operations, are a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, blow-outs, fires, releases of hazardous materials, explosions and mechanical problems that could cause substantial adverse financial impacts. These events could result in injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property or natural resources (including public parks), environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, and substantial losses to us. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Particularly for our distribution lines located near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering areas, the damages resulting from any such events could be great.Increased risks of regulatory penalties could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.Business activities in the energy sector are heavily regulated, primarily by agencies of the federal government. Agencies that historically sought voluntary compliance, or issued non-monetary sanctions, now employ mandatory civil penalty structures for regulatory violations. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 increased FERC's civil penalty authority for violation of FERC statutes, rules and orders. FERC may now impose penalties of $1.0 million per violation, per day. The CFTC, EPA, OSHA and MSHA also impose civil penalties to enforce compliance requirements relative to our business. In addition, FERC has delegated certain aspects of authority for enforcement of electric system reliability standards to the NERC, with similar penalty authority for violations. If a serious regulatory violation did occur, and penalties were imposed by FERC or another federal agency, this action could have a material adverse effect on our operations or our financial results.Ongoing changes in the United States electric utility industry, including state and federal regulatory changes, a potential increase in the number or geographic scale of our competitors or the imposition of price limitations to address market volatility, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.The United States electric utility industry is experiencing increasing competitive pressures as a result of:•Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the repeal of the PUHCA;•Industry consolidation;•Consumer demands; •Transmission constraints;•Renewable resource supply requirements;•Resistance to the siting of utility infrastructure or to the granting of right-of-ways;•Technological advances; and63•Greater availability of natural gas-fired power generation, and other factors.FERC has implemented and continues to propose regulatory changes to increase access to the nationwide transmission grid by utility and non-utility purchasers and sellers of electricity.  Industry deregulation in some states led to the disaggregation of vertically integrated utilities into separate generation, transmission and distribution businesses. Deregulation initiatives in a number of states may encourage further disaggregation. As a result, significant additional competitors could become active in the generation, transmission and distribution segments of our industry, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.In addition, the independent system operators who oversee many of the wholesale power markets have in the past imposed, and may in the future continue to impose, price limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets. These price limitations and other mechanisms may adversely affect the profitability of generating facilities that sell energy into the wholesale power markets. Given the extreme volatility and lack of meaningful long-term price history in some of these markets, and the imposition of price limitations by independent system operators, we may not be able to operate profitably in all wholesale power markets.The recent global financial crisis made the credit markets less accessible and created a shortage of available credit. If a similar financial crisis occurs in the future, we may be unable to obtain the financing needed to refinance debt, fund planned capital expenditures or otherwise execute our operating strategy.  A shortage of available credit at reasonable rates could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.Our ability to execute our operating strategy is highly dependent upon our access to capital. Historically, we have addressed our liquidity needs (including funds required to make scheduled principal and interest payments, refinance debt and fund working capital and planned capital expenditures) with operating cash flow, borrowings under credit facilities, proceeds of debt and equity offerings and proceeds from asset sales. Our ability to access the capital markets and the costs and terms of available financing depend on many factors, including changes in our credit ratings, changes in the federal or state regulatory environment affecting energy companies, volatility in commodity or electricity prices and general economic and market conditions.In addition, given that we are a holding company and that our utility assets are owned by our subsidiaries, if we are unable to adequately access the credit markets, we could be required to take additional measures designed to ensure that our utility subsidiaries are adequately capitalized to provide safe and reliable service.  Possible additional measures would be evaluated in the context of then-prevailing market conditions, prudent financial management and any applicable regulatory requirements.The global financial situation has affected our counterparty credit risk which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.As a consequence of the global financial markets, the creditworthiness of many of our contractual counterparties (particularly financial institutions) has deteriorated.We have established guidelines, controls and limits to manage and mitigate credit risk. For our production and generation activities, we seek to mitigate our credit risk by conducting a majority of our business with investment grade companies, setting tenor and credit limits commensurate with counterparty financial strength, obtaining netting agreements and securing our credit exposure with less credit-worthy counterparties through parent company guarantees, prepayments, letters of credit and other security agreements. Although we aggressively monitor and evaluate changes in our counterparties' credit quality and adjust the credit limits based upon such changes, our credit guidelines, controls and limits may not fully protect us from increasing counterparty credit risk. To the extent the economic conditions causes our credit exposure to contractual counterparties to increase materially, such increased exposure could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.National and regional economic conditions may cause increased late payments and uncollectible accounts, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.The continued recessionary environment and any future recession may lead to an increase in late payments from retail, commercial and industrial utility customers, as well as our non-utility customers. If late payments and uncollectible accounts increase, earnings and cash flows from our continuing operations may be reduced.64Our credit ratings could be lowered below investment grade in the future. If this were to occur, it could impact our access to capital, our cost of capital and our other operating costs.Our issuer credit rating is ""Baa3"" (stable outlook) by Moody's; ""BBB-"" (stable outlook) by S&P; and ""BBB-"" (stable outlook) by Fitch.  Reduction of our credit ratings could impair our ability to refinance or repay our existing debt and to complete new financings on acceptable terms, or at all.  A downgrade could also result in counterparties requiring us to post additional collateral under existing or new contracts or trades. In addition, a ratings downgrade would increase our interest expense under some of our existing debt obligations, including borrowings under our credit facilities.We rely on cash distributions from our subsidiaries to make and maintain dividends and debt payments.  Our subsidiaries may not be able or permitted to make dividend payments or loan funds to us which could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations or pay dividends to our shareholders.We are a holding company. Our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets. Our operating cash flow and ability to service our indebtedness depend on the operating cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends or advances. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available for that purpose, whether by dividends or otherwise. In addition, each subsidiary's ability to pay dividends to us depends on any applicable contractual or regulatory restrictions that may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of cash, working capital or debt service funds.Our utility operations are regulated by state utility commissions in Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, South Dakota and Montana. In connection with the Aquila Transaction, the settlement agreements or acquisition orders approved by the CPUC, IUB, KCC and NPSC provide that, among other things, (i) our utilities in those jurisdictions cannot pay dividends if they have issued debt to third parties and the payment of a dividend would reduce their equity ratio to below 40% of their total capitalization; and (ii) neither Black Hills Utility Holdings nor any of its utility subsidiaries can extend credit to us except in the ordinary course of business and upon reasonable terms consistent with market terms.  In addition to the restrictions described above, each state in which we conduct utility operations imposes restrictions on affiliate transactions, including intercompany loans.  If our utility subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or advance funds to us as a result of these conditions, or if the ability of our utility subsidiaries to make dividends or advance funds to us is further restricted, it could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations or pay dividends to our shareholders.We expect to continue our policy of paying regular cash dividends. However, there is no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on our future earnings, capital requirements, and financial conditions, and are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Our operating subsidiaries have certain restrictions on their ability to transfer funds in the form of dividends or loans to us. See ""Liquidity and Capital Resources"" within Management's Discussion and Analysis in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these restrictions and their impact on our liquidity.Market performance or changes in other assumptions could require us to make significant unplanned contributions to our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. Increasing costs associated with our defined benefit retirement plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.We have multiple defined benefit pension plans and a non-pension postretirement plan that cover certain eligible employees. Assumptions related to future costs, return on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on our funding requirements related to these plans. These estimates and assumptions may change based on actual return on plan assets, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations.65Increasing costs associated with our health care plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.The costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees have increased substantially in recent years. We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs related to health care plans for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise. The increasing costs and funding requirements associated with our health care plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.In March 2010, the President of the United States signed PPACA as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “2010 Acts”). The 2010 Acts will have a substantial impact on health care providers, insurers, employers and individuals. The 2010 Acts will impact employers and businesses differently depending on the size of the organization and the specific impacts on a company’s employees. Certain provisions of the 2010 Acts are effective while other provisions of the 2010 Acts will be effective in future years. Although the constitutional validity of the 2010 Acts is the subject of numerous lawsuits now pending in the federal courts, the outcome of which is uncertain, the 2010 Acts could require, among other things, changes to our current employee benefit plans and in our administrative and accounting processes. The ultimate extent and cost of these changes cannot be determined at this time and are being evaluated and updated as related regulations and interpretations of the 2010 Acts become available and as the results of pending litigation become final. We have disclosed a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and if we do not adequately remediate this weakness or if we have other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  As disclosed in Item 9A, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to accounting for income taxes.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, that result in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of this material weakness, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2011.  Management is taking measures to remediate the material weakness and to enhance our internal controls over financial reporting.  If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements or other errors and we could be required to restate our financial results.  If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, we may be unable to obtain additional financing, and our business and financial condition could be harmed.If market or other conditions adversely affect operations or require us to make changes to our business strategy in any of our utility businesses, we may be forced to record a non-cash goodwill impairment charge.  Any significant impairment of our goodwill related to these utilities would cause a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net income and shareholders' equity.We had approximately $353.4 million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2011.  A substantial portion of the goodwill is related to the Aquila Transaction.  If we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect operations in any of our businesses, we may be forced to record a non-cash impairment charge, which would reduce our reported assets and net income.  Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.  If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill in the period the determination is made.  The testing of goodwill for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions.  These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including future business operating performance, changes in economic, regulatory, industry or market conditions, changes in business operations, changes in competition or changes in technologies. Any changes in key assumptions, or actual performance compared with key assumptions, about our business and its future prospects could affect the fair value of one or more business segments, which may result in an impairment charge"
3,BKH,BLACK HILLS CORP,2011-02-25,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS The nature of our business subjects us to a number of uncertainties and risks. The following risk factors and other risk factors that we discuss in our periodic reports filed with the SEC should be considered for a better understanding of our Company. These important factors and other matters discussed herein could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking statements. Regulatory commissions may refuse to approve some or all of the utility rate increases we have requested or may request in the future, or may determine that amounts passed through to customers were not prudently incurred and are, therefore, not recoverable. Our regulated electric and gas utility operations are subject to cost-of-service regulation and earnings oversight from federal and state utility commissions. This regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of desired earnings levels. Our retail electric and gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding. The rates that we are allowed to charge may or may not match our related costs and allowed return on invested capital at any given time. While rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that the state public utility commissions will judge all of our costs, including our borrowing and debt service costs, to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that produce a full recovery of our costs and the return on invested capital allowed by the applicable state public utility commission. To some degree, each of our gas and electric utilities in South Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, Iowa and Kansas are permitted to recover certain costs (such as increased fuel and purchased power costs, as applicable) without having to file a rate case. To the extent we are able to pass through such costs to our customers and a state public utility commission subsequently determines that such costs should not have been paid by the customers, we may be required to refund such costs. Any such costs not recovered through rates, or any such refund, could negatively affect our revenues, cash flows and results of operations. We have deferred a substantial amount of income tax related to various tax planning strategies including the deferral of a gain associated with the assets sold in the IPP Transaction. If the Internal Revenue Service successfully challenges these tax positions, our results of operations, financial position or liquidity could be adversely affected. We have deferred a substantial amount of tax payments through various tax planning strategies, including the deferral of approximately $125 million in taxes associated with the IPP Transaction and the Aquila Transaction.  We had previously deferred approximately $185 million in taxes associated with the IPP Transaction and the Aquila Transaction, and in the third quarter of 2010, we reached an agreement with the Appeals Division of the IRS that resulted in a decrease in the amount of such deferral from $185 million to $125 million. The decrease represents the downward adjustment to tax depreciation allowed on certain assets sold, which resulted in a decrease to the gain realized on the sale of those assets and ultimately a decrease in deferred taxes. The remaining $125 million in deferred taxes relating to the IPP Transaction and the Aquila Transaction continues to be subject to IRS review. We cannot be certain that the IRS will accept our tax positions.  If the IRS successfully sought to assert contrary tax positions, we could be required to pay a significant amount of these deferred taxes earlier than currently forecasted.  In certain circumstances, the IRS may assess penalties when challenging our tax positions.  If we were unsuccessful in defending against these penalties, it may have a material impact on our results of operations.  54 We could incur additional and substantial write-downs of the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties, which would adversely impact our earnings. We review the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties under the full cost accounting rules of the SEC on a quarterly basis. This quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test. Under the ceiling test, capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues (adjusted for cash flow hedges) less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects. In calculating future net revenues, SEC-defined commodity prices and recent costs are utilized. Such prices and costs are utilized except when different prices and costs are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts. Two primary factors in the ceiling test are natural gas and oil reserve levels and SEC-defined oil and gas prices, both of which impact the present value of estimated future net revenues. Revisions to estimates of natural gas and oil reserves, or an increase or decrease in prices, can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues. Any excess of the net book value, less deferred income taxes, is generally written off as an expense. We recorded non-cash impairment charges in the first quarter of 2009 and fourth quarter of 2008 due to the full cost ceiling limitations. We may have to record additional non-cash impairment charges in the future if commodity prices drive the SEC-defined prices below levels that precipitated the 2009 and 2008 impairments. See Note 12 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Estimates of the quantity and value of our proved oil and gas reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves. There are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and their values. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves requires interpretation of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Significant inaccuracies in interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves. The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretations and judgment, and the assumptions used regarding quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves, future capital expenditures and prices for oil and natural gas. Actual prices, production, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary from those assumed in our estimates. These variances may be significant. Any significant variance from the assumptions used could cause the actual quantity of our reserves, and future net cash flow, to be materially different from our estimates. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production, changes in future capital expenditures and fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices after the date of the estimate may result in substantial upward or downward revisions.  <font style=""font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;"">Estimates of the quality and quantity of our coal reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in three dimensional structural modeling. There are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of coal reserves. The process of coal volume estimation requires interpretations of drill hole log data and subsequent computer modeling of the intersected deposit. Significant inaccuracies in interpretation or modeling could materially affect the quantity and quality of our reserve estimates. The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment of known data, assumptions used regarding structural limits and mining extents, conditions encountered during actual reserve recovery and undetected deposit anomalies. Variance from the assumptions used and drill hole modeling density could result in additions or deletions from our volume estimates. In addition, future environmental, economic or geologic changes may occur or become known that require reserve revisions either upward or downward from prior reserve estimates. Municipal governments may seek to limit or deny franchise privileges. Municipal governments within our utility service territories possess the power of condemnation, and could establish a municipal utility within a portion of our current service territories by limiting or denying franchise privileges for our operations, and exercising powers of condemnation over all or part of our utility assets within municipal boundaries. Although condemnation is a process that is subject to constitutional protections requiring just compensation, as with any judicial procedure, the outcome is uncertain. If a municipality sought to pursue this course of action, we cannot assure that we would secure adequate recovery of our investment in assets subject to condemnation. 55 Our current or future development, expansion and acquisition activities may not be successful, which could impair our ability to execute our growth strategy. Execution of our future growth plan is dependent on successful ongoing and future development, expansion and acquisition activities. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to complete development projects or acquisitions we undertake or continue to develop attractive opportunities for growth. Factors that could cause our activities to be unsuccessful include: •    Our inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals; •    Our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all; •    The possibility that one or more rating agencies would downgrade our issuer credit rating to below investment grade, thus increasing our cost of doing business; •    Our inability to successfully integrate any businesses we acquire; •    </font>Our inability to retain management or other key personnel; •    Our inability to negotiate acceptable acquisition, construction, fuel supply, power sales or other material agreements; </div>•    The trend of utilities building their own generation or looking for developers to develop and build projects for sale to utilities under turnkey arrangements; •    Lower than anticipated increases in the demand for utility services in our target markets; •    Changes in federal, state, local or tribal laws and regulations, particularly those which would make it more difficult or costly to fully develop our coal reserves and our coal-fired generation capacity; •    Fuel prices or fuel supply constraints; •    Pipeline capacity and transmission constraints; and •    Competition. We can provide no assurance that results from any acquisition will conform to our expectations. There may be additional risks associated with the operation of any newly acquired assets. Acquisitions are subject to a number of uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Factors which may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected results include: •    Delay in, and restrictions imposed as part of, any required governmental or regulatory approvals; •    The loss of management or other key personnel;table> •    The diversion of our management's attention from other business segments; and •    Integration and operational issues. Construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve significant risks which could reduce revenues or increase expenses. The construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve many risks, including: •    The inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals along with the cost of complying with or satisfying conditions imposed upon such approvals;56  •    Contractual restrictions upon the timing of scheduled outages; •    Cost of supplying or securing replacement power during scheduled and unscheduled outages; •    The unavailability or increased cost of equipment; •    The cost of recruiting and retaining or the unavailability of skilled labor; •    Supply interruptions, work stoppages and labor disputes; •    Capital and operating costs to comply with increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations; •    Opposition by members of public or special-interest groups;  •    Weather interferences;  •    Unexpected engineering, environmental and geological problems; and •    Unanticipated cost overruns. The ongoing operation of our facilities involves many of the risks described above, in addition to risks relating to the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency. New plants may employ recently developed and technologically complex equipment, including newer environmental emission control technology. Any of these risks could cause us to operate below expected capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues, increase expenses or cause us to incur higher maintenance costs and penalties. While we maintain insurance, obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance and our rights under warranties or performance guarantees may not be timely or adequate to cover lost revenues, increased expenses or liquidated damage payments. Our operating results can be adversely affected by variations from normal weather conditions. Our utility businesses are seasonal businesses and weather patterns can have a material impact on our operating performance. Demand for electricity is typically greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating. Because natural gas is primarily used for residential and commercial heating, the demand for this product depends heavily upon winter weather patterns throughout our service territory and a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating seasons. Accordingly, our utility operations have historically generated lower revenues and income when weather conditions are cooler than normal in the summer and warmer than normal in the winter. Unusually mild summers and winters therefore could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Because prices for some of our products and services and operating costs for our business are volatile, our revenues and expenses may fluctuate. A substantial portion of our net income in recent years was attributable to sales of contract and off-system wholesale electricity and natural gas into a robust market. Energy prices are influenced by many factors outside our control, including, among other things, fuel prices, transmission constraints, supply and demand, weather, general economic conditions, and the rules, regulations and actions of system operators in those markets. Moreover, unlike most other commodities, electricity cannot be stored and therefore must be produced concurrently with its use. As a result, wholesale power markets are subject to significant, unpredictable price fluctuations over relatively short periods of time. The success of our oil and gas operations is affected by the prevailing market prices of oil and natural gas. Oil and natural gas prices and markets historically have also been, and are likely to continue to be, volatile. A decrease in oil or natural gas prices would not only reduce revenues and profits, but would also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable, and may result in charges to earnings for impairment of the net capitalized cost of these assets. Oil and natural gas prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. A decline in oil and natural gas price volatility could also affect our revenues and returns from Energy Marketing, which historically tend to increase when markets are volatile. 57 Our mining operation requires a reliable supply of replacement parts, explosives, fuel, tires and steel-related products. If the cost of any of these increase significantly, or if a source of these supplies or mining equipment was unavailable to meet our replacement demands, our productivity and profitability could be lower than our current expectations. In recent years, industry-wide demand growth exceeded supply growth for certain surface mining equipment and off-the-road tires. As a result, lead times for some items generally increased to several months and prices for these items increased significantly. Our hedging activities that are designed to protect against commodity price and financial market risks may cause fluctuations in reported financial results. We use various financial contracts and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, to manage commodity price and financial market risks. The timing of the recognition of gains or losses on these economic hedges in accordance with GAAP does not always match up with the gains or losses on the commodities or assets being hedged. The difference in accounting can result in volatility in reported results, even though the expected profit margin may be essentially unchanged from the dates the transactions were consummated. Derivatives regulations included in current financial reform legislation could impede our ability to manage business and financial risks by restricting our use of derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates. In July 2010, Dodd-Frank was passed by Congress and signed into law. Dodd-Frank contains significant derivatives regulations, including a requirement that certain transactions be cleared on exchanges and a requirement to post cash collateral (commonly referred to as ""margin"") for such transactions. Dodd-Frank provides for a potential exception from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end-users and it includes a number of defined terms that will be used in determining how this exception applies to particular derivative transactions and the parties to those transactions. Dodd-Frank requires the CFTC to promulgate rules to define these terms, however we do not yet know the rules that the CFTC will actually promulgate or whether the rules or exceptions thereto will apply to us.  We use crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments in conjunction with our Energy Marketing activities and to hedge the sales price for a portion of our expected oil and gas production. We also use interest rate derivative instruments to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations. Depending on the regulations adopted by the CFTC, we could be required to post additional collateral with our dealer counterparties for our commitments and interest rate derivative transactions. Such a requirement could have a significant impact on our business by reducing our ability to execute derivative transactions to reduce commodity price and interest rate uncertainty and to protect cash flows. Requirements to post collateral may cause significant liquidity issues by reducing our ability to use cash for investment or other corporate purposes, or may require us to increase our level of debt. In addition, a requirement for our counterparties to post collateral could result in additional costs being passed on to us, thereby decreasing our profitability. Our use of derivative financial instruments could result in material financial losses. From time to time, we have sought to limit a portion of the potential adverse effects resulting from changes in commodity prices and interest and foreign exchange rates by using derivative financial instruments and other hedging mechanisms, and by the activities we conduct in our trading operations. To the extent that we hedge our commodity price and interest rate exposures, we forego the benefits we would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in our favor. In addition, even though they are closely monitored by management, our hedging and trading activities can result in losses. Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the hedge arrangement, the hedge is economically imperfect, commodity prices or interest rates move unfavorably related to our physical or financial positions, or hedging policies and procedures are not followed. Our Energy Marketing and Utility operations rely on storage and transportation assets owned by third parties to satisfy their obligations. Our energy marketing operations involve contracts to buy and sell natural gas, crude oil, coal and other commodities, many of which are settled by physical delivery. We depend on pipelines and other storage and transportation facilities owned by third parties to satisfy our delivery obligations under these contracts. Our Gas Utilities also rely on pipeline companies and other owners of gas storage facilities to deliver natural gas to ratepayers and to hedge commodity costs. If storage capacity is inadequate or transportation is disrupted, our ability to satisfy our obligations may be hindered. As a result, we may be responsible for damages incurred by our counterparties, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at then-current market rates, or for penalties imposed by state regulatory authorities.58  We may be adversely affected if we fail to achieve or maintain compliance with existing or future governmental regulations or requirements, or by the potentially high cost of complying with such requirements or addressing environmental liabilities. Our business is subject to extensive energy, environmental and other laws and regulations of federal, state, tribal and local authorities.  We generally must obtain and comply with a variety of regulations, licenses, permits and other approvals in order to operate, which can require significant capital expenditure and operating costs.  If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to civil or criminal liability and the imposition of penalties, liens or fines, claims for property damage or personal injury, or environmental clean-up costs.  In addition, existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted, and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities, which could require additional unexpected expenditures or cause us to reevaluate the feasibility of continued operations at certain sites, and have a detrimental effect on our business. In connection with certain acquisitions, we assumed liabilities associated with the environmental condition of certain properties, regardless of when such liabilities arose, whether known or unknown, and in some cases agreed to indemnify the former owners of those properties for environmental liabilities.  Future steps to bring our facilities into compliance or to address contamination from legacy operations, if necessary, could be expensive and could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.  We expect our environmental compliance expenditures to be substantial in the future due to the continuing trends toward stricter standards, greater regulation, more extensive permitting requirements and an increase in the number of assets we operate. Our energy marketing segment may be subject to increased regulation. In January 2010, the CFTC proposed regulations aimed at establishing speculative position limits on energy commodities.  The proposed regulations would apply to all CFTC-regulated exchanges and would cap the number of contracts a market participant can hold at the NYMEX or Intercontinental Exchange.  The position limit would restrict the amount of contracts a market participant can hold at any one time.  This proposal is intended to curb excessive speculation in the energy markets and is part of a wider push to overhaul the financial markets.  Due to uncertainty as to the final outcome of any rulemaking or legislation, we cannot definitively estimate the effect of increased regulation on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.  Our financial performance depends on the successful operations of our facilities. Operating electric generating facilities, the coal mine and electric and natural gas distribution systems involves risks, including: •    Operational limitations imposed by environmental and other regulatory requirements. •    Interruptions to supply of fuel and other commodities used in generation and distribution. The Gas Utilities purchase fuel from a number of suppliers. Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the delivery of fuel due to various factors, including but not limited to, transportation delays, labor relations, weather, and environmental regulations which could limit the Gas Utilities' ability to operate their facilities. •    Breakdown or failure of equipment or processes. •    Inability to recruit and retain skilled technical labor. •    Labor relations. Approximately 33% of our employees are represented by a total of six collective bargaining agreements. We are currently in contract renewal negotiations on two of these agreements.  Three separate arbitration proceedings have been initiated by the respective union locals concerning changes we made to our pension plans.  •&nbsp;   Disrupted transmission and distribution. We depend on transmission and distribution facilities, including those operated by unaffiliated parties, to deliver the electricity and gas that we sell to our retail and wholesale customers. If transmission is interrupted, our ability to sell or deliver product and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered. •    Operating hazards such as leaks, mechanical problems and accidents, including explosions, affecting our natural gas distribution system which could impact public safety, reliability and customer confidence.  59 We may be vulnerable to cyber attacks and terrorism.&nbsp;Man-made problems such as computer viruses, terrorism, theft and sabotage, may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results. We operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Our technology systems may be vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism and other causes. If our technology systems were to fail or be breached and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we may be unable to fulfill critical business functions and sensitive, confidential and other data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, our generation plants, fuel storage facilities, transmission and distribution facilities may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy products. Federal and state laws concerning greenhouse gas regulations and air emissions may materially increase our generation and production costs and could render some of our generating units uneconomical to operate and maintain.We own and operate regulated and non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants in South Dakota, Wyoming, and Colorado. We recently completed another fossil-fuel generating plant in Wyoming and are constructing others in Colorado. Recent developments under federal and state laws and regulations governing air emissions from fossil-fuel generating plants will likely result in more stringent emission limitations, which could have a material impact on our costs or operations. Various pending or final state and EPA regulations that will impact our facilities are also discussed in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption ""Environmental Matters."" On April 29, 2010, the EPA published proposed Industrial and Commercial Boiler regulations, which provide for hazardous air pollutant-related emission limits and monitoring requirements for both major and area sources of hazardous air pollutants. The final rule has a court-ordered deadline of February 21, 2011 and we will evaluate once final. If issued as proposed, will have significant impact at our Neil Simpson I, Osage, Ben French and W.N. Clark facilities. The regulation currently has a three year compliance window and will require an engineering evaluation to determine economic viability of continued operations at these units. We currently expect that, the adoption of these regulations will lead to retirement of these units within three years of the effective date of the final rule. The EPA is obligated under a court-approved consent decree to sign a proposed electric utility hazardous air pollutant rule (Utility MACT rule) by March 16, 2011 and sign its notice of final rulemaking by November 16, 2011. We expect that affected units will have three years from effective date to be in compliance with the new rules. In 2010, we participated in the EPA's efforts to gather data for rule development. Certain requirements of that regulation could have significant impacts on the Neil Simpson II, Wygen I, Wygen II, Wygen III and Wyodak facilities. On June 23, 2010, the EPA published in the Federal Register the GHG Tailoring Rule, implementing regulations of GHG for permitting purposes. This rule will impact us in the event of a major modification at an existing facility or in the event of a new major source. Existing permitted facilities will see monitoring reporting requirements incorporated into their operating permits upon renewal. New projects or major modifications to existing projects will result in a Best Available Control Technology review that could result in more stringent emissions control practices and technologies. In 2010, the State of Colorado enacted House Bill 1365, the Colorado Clean Air, Clean Jobs Act, a coordinated utility plan to reduce air emissions from coal fired power plants and promoting the use of natural gas and other low emitting resources. This act has a significant impact on our W.N. Clark facility and on October 29, 2010, Colorado Electric filed testimony with the CPUC that recommended retirement of the W.N. Clark facility to comply with House Bill 1365 within three years of promulgation of the EPA's proposed Industrial and Commercial Boiler Hazardous Air Pollutant Regulations, or in the absence of such regulation, to retire the units by the end of 2017. On December 16, 2010, the CPUC issued an order approving the closure of the W.N. Clark generation facility by December 31, 2013, and granted a presumption of need for replacement of the plant. Colorado Electric proposed to construct a third 92 MW General Electric LMS100 natural gas-fired turbine at its Pueblo Airport Generation Station.  Colorado Electric will file a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity in the first quarter of 2011 that will provide additional justification for the incremental 50 MW generation capacity. Due to uncertainty as to the final outcome of federal climate change legislation, or regulatory changes under the Clean Air Act, we cannot definitively estimate the effect of GHG regulation on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The impact of GHG legislation or regulation upon our company will depend upon many factors, including but not limited to the timing of implementation, the GHG sources that are regulated, the overall GHG emissions cap level, and the availability of technologies to control or reduce GHG emissions. If a ""cap and trade"" structure is implemented, the impact will also be affected by the degree to which offsets are allowed, the allocation of emission allowances to specific sources, and the effect of carbon regulation on natural gas and coal prices.60 New or more stringent regulations or other energy efficiency requirements could require us to incur significant additional costs relating to, among other things, the installation of additional emission control equipment, the acceleration of capital expenditures, the purchase of additional emissions allowances or offsets, the acquisition or development of additional energy supply from renewable resources, and the closure of certain generating facilities. To the extent our regulated fossil-fuel generating plants are included in rate base, we will attempt to recover costs associated with complying with emission standards or other requirements. We will also attempt to recover the emission compliance costs of our non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants from utility and other purchasers of the power generated by our non-regulated power plants. Any unrecovered costs could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, future changes in environmental regulations governing air emissions could render some of our power generating units more expensive or uneconomical to operate and maintain.Governmental authorities may assess penalties on us if it is determined that we have not complied with environmental laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond our control, that failure may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines against us. Recent lawsuits by the EPA and various states filed against others within industries in which we operate, including enforcement actions under the EPA's New Source Review rule, highlight the environmental risks faced by generating facilities, in general, and coal-fired generating facilities in particular. The characteristics of coal may make it difficult for coal users to comply with various environmental standards related to coal combustion or utilization. As a result, coal users may switch to other fuels, which could affect the volume of our sales and the price of our products. Coal contains impurities, including but not limited to sulfur, mercury, chlorine, carbon and other elements or compounds, many of which are released into the air when coal is burned. Stricter environmental regulations of emissions from coal-fueled power plants could increase the costs of using coal thereby reducing demand for coal as a fuel source and the volume and price of our coal sales. Stricter regulations could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative in the planning and building of power plants in the future. Proposed reductions in emissions of mercury, sulfur dioxides, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, or greenhouse gases may require the installation of costly emission control technology or the implementation of other measures. For example, in order to meet the federal Clean Air Act limits for SO2 emission from power plants, coal users may need to install scrubbers, use SO2 emission allowances (some of which they may purchase), blend high-sulfur coal with low-sulfur coal or switch to other fuels. Reductions in mercury emission required by certain states will likely require some power plants to install new equipment, at substantial cost, or discourage the use of certain coals containing higher levels of mercury.  Existing or proposed legislation focusing on emissions enacted by the United States or individual states could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative for our customers and could impose a tax or fee on the producer of the coal. If our customers decrease the volume of coal they purchase from us or switch to alternative fuels as a result of existing or future environmental regulations aimed at reducing emissions, our operations and financial results could be adversely impacted. Our energy production, transmission and distribution activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs. Inherent in our natural gas distribution activities, as well as our production, transportation and storage of crude oil and natural gas and our coal mining operations, are a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, blow-outs, fires, releases of hazardous materials, explosions and mechanical problems that could cause substantial adverse financial impacts. These events could result in injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property or natural resources (including public parks), environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, and substantial losses to us. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations. Particularly for our distribution lines located near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering areas, the damages resulting from any such events could be great. 61 Increased risks of regulatory penalties could negatively impact our business. Business activities in the energy sector are heavily regulated, primarily by agencies of the federal government. Agencies that historically sought voluntary compliance, or issued non-monetary sanctions, now employ mandatory civil penalty structures for regulatory violations. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 increased FERC's civil penalty authority for violation of FERC statutes, rules and orders. FERC may now impose penalties of $1.0 million per violation, per day. The CFTC, EPA, OSHA and MSHA also impose civil penalties to enforce compliance requirements relative to our business. In addition, FERC has delegated certain aspects of authority for enforcement of electric system reliability standards to the NERC, with similar penalty authority for violations. If a serious regulatory violation did occur, and penalties were imposed by FERC or another federal agency, this action could have a material adverse effect on our operations or our financial results. Ongoing changes in the United States electric utility industry, including state and federal regulatory changes, a potential increase in the number or geographic scale of our competitors or the imposition of price limitations to address market volatility, could adversely affect our profitability. The United States electric utility industry is experiencing increasing competitive pressures as a result of: •    Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the repeal of the PUHCA; •    Industry consolidation; •    Consumer demands;  •    Transmission constraints; •    Renewable resource supply requirements; •    Resistance to the siting of utility infrastructure or to the granting of right-of-ways; •    Technological advances; and •    Greater availability of natural gas-fired power generation, and other factors. FERC has implemented and continues to propose regulatory changes to increase access to the nationwide transmission grid by utility and non-utility purchasers and sellers of electricity.  Industry deregulation in some states led to the disaggregation of vertically integrated utilities into separate generation, transmission and distribution businesses. Deregulation initiatives in a number of states may encourage further disaggregation. As a result, significant additional competitors could become active in the generation, transmission and distribution segments of our industry, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the independent system operators who oversee many of the wholesale power markets have in the past imposed, and may in the future continue to impose, price limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets. These price limitations and other mechanisms may adversely affect the profitability of generating facilities that sell energy into the wholesale power markets. Given the extreme volatility and lack of meaningful long-term price history in some of these markets, and the imposition of price limitations by independent system operators, we may not be able to operate profitably in all wholesale power markets. The recent global financial crisis made the credit markets less accessible and created a shortage of available credit. Should a similar financial crisis occur in the future, we may be unable to obtain the financing needed to refinance debt, fund planned capital expenditures or otherwise execute our operating strategy. Our ability to execute our operating strategy is highly dependent upon our access to capital. Historically, we have addressed our liquidity needs (including funds required to make scheduled principal and interest payments, refinance debt and fund working capital and planned capital expenditures) with operating cash flow, borrowings under credit facilities, proceeds of debt and equity offerings and proceeds from asset sales. Our ability to access the capital markets and the costs and terms of available financing depend on many factors, including changes in our credit ratings, changes in the Federal or state regulatory environment affecting energy companies, volatility in commodity or electricity prices and general economic and market conditions. 62 In addition, given that we are a holding company and that our utility assets are owned by our subsidiaries, if we are unable to adequately access the credit markets, we could be required to take additional measures designed to ensure that our utility subsidiaries are adequately capitalized to provide safe and reliable service.  Possible additional measures would be evaluated in the context of then-prevailing market conditions, prudent financial management and any applicable regulatory requirements. The global financial crisis has affected our counterparty credit risk. As a consequence of the global financial crisis, the creditworthiness of many of our contractual counterparties (particularly financial institutions) has deteriorated. We have established guidelines, controls and limits to manage and mitigate credit risk. For our energy marketing, production and generation activities, we seek to mitigate our credit risk by conducting a majority of our business with investment grade companies, setting tenor and credit limits commensurate with counterparty financial strength, obtaining netting agreements and securing our credit exposure with less creditworthy counterparties through parent company guarantees, prepayments, letters of credit and other security agreements. Although we aggressively monitor and evaluate changes in our counterparties' credit quality and adjust the credit limits based upon such changes, our credit guidelines, controls and limits may not fully protect us from increasing counterparty credit risk. To the extent the economic conditions causes our credit exposure to contractual counterparties to increase materially, such increased exposure could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. National and regional economic conditions may cause increased late payments and uncollectible accounts, which would reduce earnings and cash flows. The continued recessionary environment and any future recession may lead to an increase in late payments from retail, commercial and industrial utility customers, as well as our non-utility customers (including marketing counterparties). If late payments and uncollectible accounts increase, earnings and cash flows from our continuing operations may be reduced. Our credit ratings could be lowered below investment grade in the future. If this were to occur, it could impact our access to capital, our cost of capital and our other operating costs. Our issuer credit rating is ""Baa3"" (stable outlook) by Moody's; ""BBB-"" (stable outlook) by S&P; and ""BBB"" (stable outlook) by Fitch.  Reduction of our credit ratings could impair our ability to refinance or repay our existing debt and to complete new financings on acceptable terms, or at all.  A downgrade could also result in counterparties requiring us to post additional collateral under existing or new contracts or trades. In addition, a ratings downgrade would increase our interest expense under some of our existing debt obligations, including borrowings under our credit facilities. We rely on cash distributions from our subsidiaries to make and maintain dividends and debt payments. Our subsidiaries may not be able or permitted to make dividend payments or loan funds to us. We are a holding company. Our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets. Our operating cash flow and ability to service our indebtedness depend on the operating cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends or advances. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available for that purpose, whether by dividends or otherwise. In addition, each subsidiary's ability to pay dividends to us depends on any applicable contractual or regulatory restrictions that may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of cash, working capital or debt service funds. Our utility operations are regulated by state utility commissions in Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, South Dakota and Montana. In connection with the Aquila Transaction, the settlement agreements or acquisition orders approved by the CPUC, IUB, KCC and NPSC provide that, among other things, (i) our utilities in those jurisdictions cannot pay dividends if they have issued debt to third parties and the payment of a dividend would reduce their equity ratio to below 40% of their total capitalization; and (ii) neither Black Hills Utility Holdings nor any of its utility subsidiaries can extend credit to us except in the ordinary course of business and upon reasonable terms consistent with market terms. In addition to the restrictions described above, each state in which we conduct utility operations imposes restrictions on affiliate transactions, including intercompany loans. If our utility subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or advance funds to us as a result of these conditions, or if the ability of our utility subsidiaries to make dividends or advance funds to us is further restricted, it could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations or pay dividends to our shareholders. 63 We expect to continue our policy of paying regular cash dividends. However, there is no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on our future earnings, capital requirements, and financial conditions, and are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Our operating subsidiaries have certain restrictions on their ability to transfer funds in the form of dividends or loans to us. See ""Liquidity and Capital Resources"" within Management's Discussion and Analysis in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these restrictions and their impact on our liquidity. Increasing costs associated with our defined benefit retirement plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. <div style=""line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"">We have multiple defined benefit pension and non-pension postretirement plans that cover certain employees. Assumptions related to future costs, return on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on our funding requirements related to these plans. These estimates and assumptions may change based on actual return on plan assets, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations. Increasing costs associated with our health care plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. The costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees have increased substantially in recent years. We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs related to health care plans for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise. The increasing costs and funding requirements associated with our health care plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In March 2010, the President of the United States signed PPACA as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively the “2010 Acts”). The 2010 Acts will have a substantial impact on health care providers, insurers, employers and individuals. The 2010 Acts will impact employers and businesses differently depending on the size of the organization and the specific impacts on a company’s employees. Certain provisions of the 2010 Acts became effective during our open enrollment period (November 1, 2010) while other provisions of the 2010 Acts will be effective in future years. Although the constitutional validity of the 2010 Acts is the subject of numerous lawsuits now pending in the federal courts, the outcome of which is uncertain, the 2010 Acts could require, among other things, changes to our current employee benefit plans and in our administrative and accounting processes. The ultimate extent and cost of these changes cannot be determined at this time and are being evaluated and updated as related regulations and interpretations of the 2010 Acts become available, and as the results of pending litigation become final.  An effective system of internal control may not be maintained, leading to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management to make an assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal controls. Our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of these controls. During their assessment of these controls, management or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify areas of weakness in control design or effectiveness, which may lead to the conclusion that a material weakness in internal control exists. Any control deficiencies we identify in the future could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis, which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports or have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business or access sources of liquidity. 64 We have recorded a substantial amount of goodwill associated with the Aquila Transaction. Any significant impairment of our goodwill related to these utilities would cause a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net income and shareholders' equity. We had approximately $354.8 million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2010. A substantial portion of the goodwill is related to the Aquila Transaction. If we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect operations in any of these businesses, we may be forced to record a non-cash impairment charge, which would reduce our reported assets and net income. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill in the period the determination is made. The testing of goodwill for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including future business operating performance, changes in economic, regulatory, industry or market conditions, changes in business operations, changes in competition or changes in technologies. Any changes in key assumptions, or actual performance compared with key assumptions, about our business and its future prospects could affect the fair value of one or more business segments, which may result in an impairment charge. "
15,BKH,BLACK HILLS CORP,2010-02-26,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSThe nature of our business subjects us to a number of uncertainties and risks.  The following risk factors and other risk factors that we discuss in our periodic reports filed with the SEC should be considered for a better understanding of our Company.  These important factors and other matters discussed herein could causeour actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking statements.The recent global financial crisis made the credit markets less accessible and created a shortage of available credit.  Should a similar financial crisis occur in the future, we may be unable to obtain the financing needed to refinance debt, fund planned capital expenditures or otherwise execute our operating strategy.Our ability to execute our operating strategy is highly dependent upon our access to capital.  Historically, we have addressed our liquidity needs (including funds required to make scheduled principal and interest payments, refinance debt and fund working capital and planned capital expenditures) with operating cash flow, borrowingsunder credit facilities, proceeds of debt and equity offerings and proceeds from asset sales.  Our ability to access the capital markets and the costs and terms of available financing depend on many factors, including changes in our credit ratings, changes in the Federal or state regulatory environment affecting energy companies, volatility in commodity or electricity prices and general economic and market conditions.In addition, given that we are a holding company and that our utility assets are owned by our subsidiaries, if we are unable to adequately access the credit markets, we could be required to take additional measures designed to ensure that our utility subsidiaries are adequately capitalized to provide safe and reliable service.  Possibleadditional measures would be evaluated in the context of market conditions then-prevailing, prudent financial management and any applicable regulatory requirements.The global financial crisis has affected our counterparty credit risk.As a consequence of the global financial crisis, the creditworthiness of many of our contractual counterparties (particularly financial institutions) has deteriorated.We have established guidelines, controls and limits to manage and mitigate credit risk.  For our energy marketing, production and generation activities, we seek to mitigate our credit risk by conducting a majority of our business with investment grade companies, setting tenor and credit limits commensurate with counterparty financialstrength, obtaining netting agreements and securing our credit exposure with less creditworthy counterparties through parent company guarantees, prepayments, letters of credit and other security agreements.  Although we aggressively monitor and evaluate changes in our counterparties' credit quality and adjust the credit limits based upon such changes, our credit guidelines, controls and limits may not fully protect us from increasing counterparty credit risk.  To the extent the financial crisiscauses our credit exposure to contractual counterparties to increase materially, such increased exposure could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.National and regional economic conditions may cause increased late payments and uncollectible accounts, which would reduce earnings and cash flows.The prolonged recession may lead to an increase in late payments from retail and commercial utility customers, as well as our non-utility customers (including marketing counterparties).  If late payments and uncollectible accounts increase, earnings and cash flows from our continuing operations may be reduced.  49  We may not be able to effectively integrate the utility operations acquired from Aquila into our existing businesses and operations, or achieve the anticipated results from the Aquila Transaction.We expect the Aquila Transaction to produce various benefits.  Achieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties, such as pending and future rate cases, and operational and financial synergies.  As a condition of the Aquila Transaction, we agreed to continue employee compensationand benefit levels for all former Aquila employees through December 31, 2009.  We began implementing several changes to compensation and benefit programs for all employees in late 2009 to become effective January 1, 2010 as part of unification initiatives deemed necessary to fully integrate these operations.  For employees represented by a collective bargaining agreement, these benefit and compensation changes are being implemented in a manner consistent with terms of these agreements.  Wecannot provide assurance that the businesses we acquired from Aquila will be integrated in an efficient and effective manner or that they will be sufficiently profitable after our integration efforts have been completed.Our credit ratings could be lowered below investment grade in the future.  If this were to occur, it could impact our access to capital, our cost of capital and our other operating costs.Our issuer credit rating is ""Baa3"" (stable outlook) by Moody's; ""BBB-"" (stable outlook) by S&P; and ""BBB"" (stable outlook) by Fitch.  Although we believe the IPP Transaction and the Aquila Transaction have strengthened our financial profile and creditworthiness, we cannot assure that our credit ratings will not be lowered.  Reductionof our credit ratings could impair our ability to refinance or repay our existing debt and to complete new financings on acceptable terms, or at all.  A downgrade could also result in counterparties requiring us to post additional collateral under existing or new contracts or trades.  In addition, a ratings downgrade would increase our interest expense under some of our existing debt obligations, including borrowings under our credit facilities.Regulatory commissions may refuse to approve some or all of the utility rate increases we have requested or may request in the future, or may determine that amounts passed through to customers were not prudently incurred and are, therefore, not recoverable.Our regulated electric and gas utility operations are subject to cost-of-service regulation and earnings oversight from federal and state utility commissions.  This regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of desired earnings levels.  Our rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by therelevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding.  The rates that we are allowed to charge may or may not match our related costs and allowed return on invested capital at any given time.  While rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that the state public utility commissions will judge all of our costs,including our borrowing and debt service costs, to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that produce a full recovery of our costs and the return on invested capital allowed by the applicable state public utility commission.To some degree, each of our regulated gas and regulated electric utilities in South Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, Iowa and Kansas are permitted to recover certain costs (such as increased fuel and purchased power costs, as applicable) without having to file a rate case.  To the extent we are able to pass through suchcosts to our customers and a state public utility commission subsequently determines that such costs should not have been paid by the customers, we may be required to refund such costs.  Any such costs not recovered through rates, or any such refund, could negatively affect our revenues, cash flows and results of operations.  50  We have deferred a substantial amount of income tax related to various tax planning strategies including the deferral of a gain associated with the assets sold in the IPP Transaction.  If the Internal Revenue Service successfully challenges these tax positions, our results of operations,financial position or liquidity could be adversely affected.We have deferred a substantial amount of tax payments through various tax planning strategies including the deferral of approximately $185 million in taxes associated with the IPP Transaction and the Aquila Transaction.  We cannot be certain that the IRS will accept our tax positions.  If the IRS successfully sought toassert contrary tax positions, we could be required to pay a significant amount of these deferred taxes earlier than currently forecasted.  In certain circumstances, the IRS may assess penalties when challenging our tax positions.  If we were unsuccessful in defending against these penalties, it may have a material impact on our results of operations.We could incur additional and substantial write-downs of the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties, which would adversely impact our earnings.We review the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties under the full cost accounting rules of the SEC on a quarterly basis.  This quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test.  Under the ceiling test, capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed anamount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues (adjusted for cash flow hedges) less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects.  In calculating future net revenues, SEC-defined commodity prices and recent costs are utilized.  Such prices and costs are utilized except when different prices and costs are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining termof those contracts.  Two primary factors in the ceiling test are natural gas and oil reserve levels and SEC-defined oil and gas prices, both of which impact the present value of estimated future net revenues.  Revisions to estimates of natural gas and oil reserves, or an increase or decrease in prices, can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues.  Any excess of the net book value, less deferred income taxes, is generally written off as an expense.We recorded non-cash impairment charges in the first quarter of 2009 and fourth quarter of 2008 due to the full cost ceiling limitations in amounts of $27.8 million and $59.0 million after-tax, respectively.  We may have to record additional non-cash impairment charges in the future if commodity prices drive the SEC-defined pricesbelow levels that precipitated the 2009 and 2008 impairments.  See Note 12 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The SEC adopted new reporting and accounting requirements for oil and gas companies that changed the way we test for potential ceiling test impairments (i.e. testing will be based on 12-month average of first day of the month commodity prices rather than a single date spot price as of the test date).  The new requirementsare effective for periods ending December 31, 2009 and apply to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Estimates of the quantity and value of our proved oil and gas reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves.There are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and their values.  The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves requires interpretation of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors.  Significant inaccuracies in interpretationsor assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.  The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretations and judgment, and the assumptions used regarding quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves, future capital expenditures and prices for oil and natural gas.  Actual prices, production, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil andnatural gas reserves may vary from those assumed in our estimates.  These variances may be significant.  Any significant variance from the assumptions used could cause the actual quantity of our reserves, and future net cash flow, to be materially different from our estimates.  In addition, results of drilling, testing and production, changes in future capital expenditures and fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices after the date of the estimate may result in substantial upwardor downward revisions.  The SEC has implemented revised reporting guidelines for reserves that apply to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2009.  Key revisions include changes to the oil and gas pricing used to estimate reserves, the use of new technology for determining reserves and authorization for optional disclosure of probable and possible reserves.  51  Estimates of the quality and quantity of our coal reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in three dimensional structural modeling.There are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of coal reserves.  The process of coal volume estimation requires interpretations of drill hole log data and subsequent computer modeling of the intersected deposit.  Significant inaccuracies in interpretation or modeling could materially affect the quantityand quality of our reserve estimates.  The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment of known data, assumptions used regarding structural limits and mining extents, conditions encountered during actual reserve recovery and undetected deposit anomalies.  Variance from the assumptions used and drill hole modeling density could result in additions or deletions from our volume estimates. In addition, future environmental, economic orgeologic changes may occur or become known that require reserve revisions either upward or downward from prior reserve estimates.Our current or future development, expansion and acquisition activities may not be successful, which could impair our ability to execute our growth strategy.Execution of our future growth plan is dependent on successful ongoing and future, development expansion and acquisition activities.  We can provide no assurance that we will be able to complete development projects or acquisitions we undertake or continue to develop attractive opportunities for growth.  Factors that couldcause our activities to be unsuccessful include:  ·Our inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals;  ·Our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all;  ·The possibility that one or more rating agencies would downgrade our issuer credit rating to below investment grade, thus increasing our cost of doing business;  ·Our inability to successfully integrate any businesses we acquire;  ·Our inability to retain management or other key personnel;  ·Our inability to negotiate acceptable acquisition, construction, fuel supply, power sales or other material agreements;  ·The trend of utilities building their own generation or looking for developers to develop and build projects for sale to utilities under turnkey arrangements;  ·Lower than anticipated increases in the demand for utility services in our target markets;  ·Changes in federal, state, local or tribal laws and regulations, particularly those which would make it more difficult or costly to fully develop our coal reserves and our coal-fired generation capacity;  ·Fuel prices or fuel supply constraints;  ·Pipeline capacity and transmission constraints; and  ·Competition.  52  We can provide no assurance that results from any acquisition will conform to our expectations.  There may be additional risks associated with the operation of any newly acquired assets.Successful acquisitions are subject to a number of uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control.  Factors which may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected results include:  ·Delay in, and restrictions imposed as part of, any required governmental or regulatory approvals;  ·The loss of management or other key personnel;  ·The diversion of our management's attention from other business segments; and  ·Integration and operational issues.Construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve significant risks which could reduce revenues or increase expenses.The construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve many risks, including:  ·The inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals;  ·Contractual restrictions upon the timing of scheduled outages;  ·Cost of supplying or securing replacement power during scheduled and unscheduled outages;  ·The unavailability or increased cost of equipment;  ·The inability and cost of recruiting and retaining skilled labor;  ·Supply interruptions, work stoppages and labor disputes;  ·Capital and operating costs to comply with increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations;  ·Opposition by members of public or special-interest groups;  ·Weather interferences;  ·Unexpected engineering, environmental and geological problems; and  ·Unanticipated cost overruns.The ongoing operation of our facilities involves many of the risks described above, in addition to risks relating to the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency.  New plants may employ recently developed and technologically complex equipment, including newer environmentalemission control technology.  Any of these risks could cause us to operate below expected capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues, increase expenses or cause us to incur higher maintenance costs and penalties.  While we maintain insurance, obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance and our rights under warranties or performance guarantees may not be timely or adequate to cover lost revenues, increasedexpenses or liquidated damage payments.  53  Our operating results can be adversely affected by weather variations from normal.Our utility businesses are seasonal businesses and weather patterns can have a material impact on our operating performance.  Demand for electricity is typically greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating.  Because natural gas is primarily used for residential and commercial heating, thedemand for this product depends heavily upon winter weather patterns throughout our service territory and a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating seasons.  Accordingly, our utility operations have historically generated lower revenues and income when weather conditions are cooler than normal in the summer and warmer than normal in the winter.  Unusually mild summers and winters therefore could have an adverse effecton our financial condition and results of operations.Because prices for some of our products and services and operating costs for our business are volatile, our revenues and expenses may fluctuate.A substantial portion of our net income in recent years was attributable to sales of contract and off-system wholesale electricity and natural gas into a robust market.  Energy prices are influenced by many factors outside our control, including, among other things, fuel prices, transmission constraints, supply and demand, weather,general economic conditions, and the rules, regulations and actions of system operators in those markets.  Moreover, unlike most other commodities, electricity cannot be stored and therefore must be produced concurrently with its use.  As a result, wholesale power markets are subject to significant, unpredictable price fluctuations over relatively short periods of time.The success of our oil and gas operations is affected by the prevailing market prices of oil and natural gas.  Oil and natural gas prices and markets historically have also been, and are likely to continue to be, volatile.  A decrease in oil or natural gas prices would not only reduce revenues and profits, but would alsoreduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable, and may result in charges to earnings for impairment of the net capitalized cost of these assets.  Oil and natural gas prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control.  A decline in oil and natural gas price volatility could also affect our revenues and returnsfrom Energy Marketing, which historically tend to increase when markets are volatile.Our mining operation requires a reliable supply of replacement parts, explosives, fuel, tires and steel-related products.  If the cost of any of these increase significantly, or if a source of these supplies or mining equipment was unavailable to meet our replacement demands, our productivity and profitability could be lower thanour current expectations.  In recent years, industry-wide demand growth exceeded supply growth for certain surface mining equipment and off-the-road tires.  As a result, lead times for some items generally increased to several months and prices for these items increased significantly.Our hedging activities that are designed to protect against commodity price and financial market risks may cause fluctuations in reported financial results.We use various financial contracts and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, to manage commodity price and financial market risks.  The timing of the recognition of gains or losses on these economic hedges in accordance with GAAP does not always match up with the gains or losses on the commodities or assetsbeing hedged.  The difference in accounting can result in volatility in reported results, even though the expected profit margin may be essentially unchanged from the dates the transactions were consummated.  54  Our use of derivative financial instruments could result in material financial losses.From time to time, we have sought to limit a portion of the adverse effects resulting from changes in natural gas and crude oil commodity prices, and interest and foreign exchange rates by using derivative financial instruments and other hedging mechanisms and by the activities we conduct in our trading operations.  To the extentthat we hedge our commodity price and interest rate exposures, we forego the benefits we would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in our favor.  In addition, even though they are closely monitored by management, our hedging and trading activities can result in losses.  Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the hedge arrangement, the hedge is economically imperfect, commodityprices or interest rates move unfavorably related to our physical or financial positions, or hedging policies and procedures are not followed.Our Energy Marketing and Utility operations rely on storage and transportation assets owned by third parties to satisfy their obligations.Our energy marketing operations involve contracts to buy and sell natural gas, crude oil and other commodities, many of which are settled by physical delivery.  We depend on pipelines and other storage and transportation facilities owned by third parties to satisfy our delivery obligations under these contracts.  Our regulatedGas Utilities also rely on pipeline companies and other owners of gas storage facilities to deliver natural gas to ratepayers and to hedge commodity costs.  If storage capacity is inadequate or transportation is disrupted, our ability to satisfy our obligations may be hindered.  As a result, we may be responsible for damages incurred by our counterparties, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at then-current market rates, or for penalties imposed by state regulatoryauthorities.Our business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and permitting requirements as well as environmental liabilities, including those we assumed in connection with certain acquisitions.  We may be adversely affected if we fail to achieve or maintain compliance with existing or future regulations or requirements,or by the potentially high cost of complying with such requirements or addressing environmental liabilities.Our business is subject to extensive energy, environmental and other laws and regulations of federal, state, tribal and local authorities.  We generally must obtain and comply with a variety of regulations, licenses, permits and other approvals in order to operate, which can require significant capital expenditure and operating costs.  Ifwe fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to civil or criminal liability and the imposition of penalties, liens or fines, claims for property damage or personal injury, or environmental clean-up costs.  In addition, existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted, and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities, which could require additional unexpected expenditures and have a detrimental effect on our business.In connection with certain acquisitions, we assumed liabilities associated with the environmental condition of certain properties, regardless of when such liabilities arose, whether known or unknown, and in some cases agreed to indemnify the former owners of those properties for environmental liabilities.  Future steps to bring ourfacilities into compliance or to address contamination from legacy operations, if necessary, could be expensive and could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.  We expect our environmental compliance expenditures to be substantial in the future due to the continuing trends toward stricter standards, greater regulation, more extensive permitting requirements and an increase in the number of assets we operate.Our energy marketing segment may be subject to increased regulations.In January 2010, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission proposed regulations aimed at establishing speculative position limits on energy commodities.  The proposed regulations would apply to all CFTC-regulated exchanges and would cap the number of contracts a market participant can hold at the NYMEX or ICE.  The positionlimit would restrict the amount of contracts a market participant can hold at any one time.  This proposal is intended to curb excessive speculation in the energy markets and is part of a wider push to overhaul the financial markets.  Due to uncertainty as to the final outcome of any legislation, we cannot definitively estimate the effect of regulation on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.  55  Our financial performance depends on the successful operations of our facilities.Operating electric generating facilities and electric and natural gas distribution systems involves risks, including:  ·Operational limitations imposed by environmental and other regulatory requirements.  ·Interruptions to supply of fuel and other commodities used in generation and distribution.  The Gas Utilities purchase fuel from a number of suppliers.  Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the delivery of fuel due to various factors, including but not limited to, transportation delays, labor relations, weather, and environmental regulations which could limit theGas Utilities’ ability to operate their facilities.  ·Breakdown or failure of equipment or processes.  ·Inability to recruit and retain skilled technical labor.  ·Labor relations. Approximately 35% of our employees are represented by a total of six collective bargaining agreements.  Four of these agreements are either currently in negotiations or planned for renewal negotiations in early 2010.  ·Disrupted transmission and distribution.  We depend on transmission and distribution facilities, including those operated by unaffiliated parties, to deliver the electricity and gas that we sell to our retail and wholesale customers.  If transmission is interrupted, our ability to sell or deliver product and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered.We may be vulnerable to cyber attacks and terrorism.Man-made problems such as computer viruses, terrorism, theft and sabotage, may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.  We operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure.  Our technology systems may bevulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism and other causes.  If our technology systems were to fail or be breached and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we may be unable to fulfill critical business functions and sensitive, confidential and other data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  In addition, our generation plants,fuel storage facilities, transmission and distribution facilities may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy products.Federal and state laws concerning climate change and air emissions, including emission reduction mandates and renewable energy portfolio standards, may materially increase our generation and production costs and could render some of our generating units uneconomical to operate and maintain.We own and operate regulated and non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants in South Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado and Idaho. We are near completion of another fossil-fuel generating plant in Wyoming and preparing to commence construction on others in Colorado. Air emissions of fossil-fuel generating plants are subject to federal, state and tribalregulation. Recent developments under federal and state laws and regulation governing air emissions from fossil-fuel generating plants will likely result in more stringent emission limitations.On October 22, 2009, the EPA filed a consent decree with environmentalists in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, requiring the agency to propose a rule directed at coal and oil-fired power plants, setting maximum achievable control technology limits for air toxins, including mercury, by March 2011 and issue a final ruleby November 2011.  While we expect this rule will be applicable to certain of our coal-fired units, we are unable to ascertain the full impact until the provisions of the proposed rule are known.  56  On April 2, 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision in the case of Massachusetts v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, holding that CO2 and other GHG emissions are pollutants subject to regulation under the motor vehicle provisions of the Clean Air Act. Thecase was remanded to the EPA for further rulemaking to determine whether GHG emissions may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, or alternatively, to explain why GHG emissions should not be regulated.  On April 17, 2009, the EPA signed its proposed Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Finding for Greenhouse Gases under Section 202 of the Clean Air Act.  Although this proposal does not specifically address stationary sources, such as power generation plants, the generalendangerment finding relative to GHG's could support such a proposal by the EPA for stationary sources.  On October 30, 2009, the EPA published final rules regarding a mandatory GHG reporting regimen, the purpose of which would be to collect data to inform future policy and regulatory decisions.In addition, the EPA published in the October 27, 2009 Federal Register a proposed rule that would tailor the major source applicability thresholds for GHG emissions under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V programs of the Clean Air Act and set a PSD significance level for GHG emissions.  EPA states thisrule is necessary because they expect to soon promulgate regulations under the Clean Air Act to control GHG emissions and as a result, trigger PSD and Title V applicability requirements.  This proposed rule would phase in the applicability thresholds for both the PSD and Title V programs for sources of GHG emissions.  The first phase, which would last six years, would establish a temporary level for the PSD and Title V applicability thresholds at 25,000 tons per year on a carbon dioxide equivalentbasis and would also establish temporary PSD significance levels.  All our generating units would exceed this threshold and if the pending rule to control GHG emissions is published and finalized, we would be required upon Title V permit renewal, to evaluate options for reducing GHG emissions, to possibly include a Best Available Control Technology review that could result in more stringent emissions control practices and technologies.  In the second phase of this proposed rule, EPA wouldwithin five years of the rule being final, review the first phase and promulgate revised applicability and significance level thresholds as appropriate.Finally, federal legislation is currently under consideration in the U.S. Congress, including H.R. 2454, ""the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009,"" which was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives on June 26, 2009.  This legislation would affect electric generation and electric and natural gas distribution companies.  H.R.2454 also proposes a national renewable electricity standard, which would implement a phased process ultimately mandating that 20% of electricity sold by retail suppliers be met by energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy resources by 2020.The climate bill under consideration in the U.S. Senate is S.1733, ""the Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act.""  S.1733 was passed by the Environment and Public Works Committee November 5, 2009, but is not expected to be brought to the Senate floor in its current form.  Other committees with jurisdiction include Finance,Energy and Natural Resources, Commerce, Agriculture, and Foreign Relations.  The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee passed S.1462, ""the American Clean Energy Leadership Act of 2009,"" on July 16, 2009, which would establish a 15% Renewable Electricity Standard by 2021.  If the Senate were to act in 2010, it is likely the climate change and renewable electricity standard portions would be combined into one bill.Due to uncertainty as to the final outcome of federal climate change legislation, or regulatory changes under the Clean Air Act, we cannot definitively estimate the effect of GHG regulation on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The impact of GHG legislation or regulation upon our company will depend upon many factors,including but not limited to the timing of implementation, the GHG sources that are regulated, the overall GHG emissions cap level, and the availability of technologies to control or reduce GHG emissions. If a ""cap and trade"" structure is implemented, the impact will also be affected by the degree to which offsets are allowed, the allocation of emission allowances to specific sources, and the effect of carbon regulation on natural gas and coal prices.  57  More stringent GHG emissions limitations or other energy efficiency requirements, however, could require us to incur significant additional costs relating to, among other things, the installation of additional emission control equipment, the acceleration of capital expenditures, the purchase of additional emissions allowances or offsets, theacquisition or development of additional energy supply from renewable resources, and the closure of certain generating facilities. To the extent our regulated fossil-fuel generating plants are included in rate base, we will attempt to recover costs associated with complying with emission standards or other requirements. We will also attempt to recover the emission compliance costs of our non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants from utility and other purchasers of the power generated by our non-regulated powerplants. Any unrecovered costs could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, future changes in environmental regulations governing air emissions could render some of our power generating units more expensive or uneconomical to operate and maintain.We own regulated electric utilities that serve customers in South Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado and Montana. To varying degrees, Colorado and Montana have each adopted mandatory renewable portfolio standards that require electric utilities to supply a minimum percentage of the power delivered to customers from renewable resources (e.g., wind,solar, biomass) by a certain date in the future. These renewable energy portfolio standards have increased the power supply costs of our electric operations. If these states increase their renewable energy portfolio standards, or if similar standards are imposed by the other states in which we operate electric utilities, our power supply costs will further increase. Although we will seek to recover these higher costs in rates, any unrecovered costs could have a material negative impact on our results of operationsand financial condition.Governmental authorities may assess penalties on us if it is determined that we have not complied with environmental laws and regulations.If we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond our control, that failure may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines against us.  Recent lawsuits by the EPA and various states filed against others within industries in which we operate, including enforcementactions under the EPA's New Source Review rule, highlight the environmental risks faced by generating facilities, in general, and coal-fired generating facilities in particular.The characteristics of coal may make it difficult for coal users to comply with various environmental standards related to coal combustion or utilization.  As a result, coal users may switch to other fuels, which could affect the volume of our sales and the price of our products.Coal contains impurities, including but not limited to sulfur, mercury, chlorine, carbon and other elements or compounds, many of which are released into the air when coal is burned.  Stricter environmental regulations of emissions from coal-fueled power plants could increase the costs of using coal thereby reducing demand for coalas a fuel source and the volume and price of our coal sales.  Stricter regulations could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative in the planning and building of power plants in the future.Proposed reductions in emissions of mercury, sulfur dioxides, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter or greenhouse gases may require the installation of costly emission control technology or the implementation of other measures, including trading of emission allowances and switching to other fuels.  For example, in order to meet thefederal Clean Air Act limits for sulfur dioxide emission from power plants, coal users may need to install scrubbers, use sulfur dioxide emission allowances (some of which they may purchase), blend high-sulfur coal with low-sulfur coal or switch to other fuels.  Reductions in mercury emission required by certain states will likely require some power plants to install new equipment, at substantial cost, or discourage the use of certain coals containing higher levels of mercury.  Recent andnew proposals calling for reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases could significantly increase the cost of operating existing coal-fueled power plants and could inhibit construction of new coal-fired power plants.  Existing or proposed legislation focusing on emissions enacted by the United States or individual states could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative for our customers and could impose a tax or fee on the producer of the coal.  If our customersdecrease the volume of coal they purchase from us or switch to alternative fuels as a result of existing or future environmental regulations aimed at reducing emissions, our operations and financial results could be adversely impacted.  58  Our energy production, transmission and distribution activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.Inherent in our natural gas distribution activities, as well as our production, transportation and storage of crude oil and natural gas and our coal mining operations, are a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, blow-outs, fires, releases of hazardous materials, explosions and mechanical problems that could cause substantialadverse financial impacts.  These events could result in injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property or natural resources (including public parks), environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, and substantial losses to us.  In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses.  The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse affect onour financial position and results of operations.  Particularly for our distribution lines located near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering areas, the damages resulting from any such events could be great.Increased risks of regulatory penalties could negatively impact our business.The Energy Policy Act of 2005 increased FERC's civil penalty authority for violation of FERC statutes, rules and orders.  FERC can now impose penalties of $1.0 million per violation, per day, and other regulatory agencies that impose compliance requirements relative to our business also have civil penalty authority.  Manyrules that were historically subject to voluntary compliance are now mandatory and subject to potential civil penalties for violations.  If a serious violation did occur, and penalties were imposed by FERC or another federal agency, this action could have a material adverse effect on our operations or our financial results.Ongoing changes in the United States electric utility industry, including state and federal regulatory changes, a potential increase in the number or geographic scale of our competitors or the imposition of price limitations to address market volatility, could adversely affect our profitability.The United States electric utility industry is experiencing increasing competitive pressures as a result of:  ·Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the repeal of the PUHCA;  ·Industry consolidation;  ·Consumer demands;  ·Transmission constraints;  ·Renewable resource supply requirements;  ·Resistance to the siting of utility infrastructure or to the granting of right-of-ways;  ·Technological advances; and  ·Greater availability of natural gas-fired power generation, and other factors.FERC has implemented and continues to propose regulatory changes to increase access to the nationwide transmission grid by utility and non-utility purchasers and sellers of electricity.  In addition, a limited number of states have implemented or are considering or currently implementing methods to introduce and promote retail competition.  Industryderegulation in some states led to the disaggregation of vertically integrated utilities into separate generation, transmission and distribution businesses.  Deregulation initiatives in a number of states may encourage further disaggregation.  As a result, significant additional competitors could become active in the generation, transmission and distribution segments of our industry, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.  59  In addition, the independent system operators who oversee many of the wholesale power markets have in the past imposed, and may in the future continue to impose, price limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets.  These price limitations and other mechanisms may adversely affect the profitabilityof generating facilities that sell energy into the wholesale power markets.  Given the extreme volatility and lack of meaningful long-term price history in some of these markets, and the imposition of price limitations by independent system operators, we may not be able to operate profitably in all wholesale power markets.We rely on cash distributions from our subsidiaries to make and maintain dividends and debt payments.  Our subsidiaries may not be able or permitted to make dividend payments or loan funds to us.We are a holding company.  Our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets.  Our operating cash flow and ability to service our indebtedness depend on the operating cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends or advances.  Our subsidiaries are separatelegal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available for that purpose, whether by dividends or otherwise.  In addition, each subsidiary's ability to pay dividends to us depends on any applicable contractual or regulatory restrictions that may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of cash, working capital or debt service funds.Our utility operations are regulated by state utility commissions in Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, South Dakota and Montana.  In connection with the Aquila Transaction, the settlement agreements or acquisition orders approved by the CPUC, NPSC, IUB and KCC provide that, among other things, (i) our utilities in thosejurisdictions cannot pay dividends if they have issued debt to third parties and the payment of a dividend would reduce their equity ratio to below 40% of their total capitalization; and (ii) neither Black Hills Utility Holdings nor any of its utility subsidiaries can extend credit to us except in the ordinary course of business and upon reasonable terms consistent with market terms.  In addition to the restrictions described above, each state in which we conduct utility operations imposes restrictionson affiliate transactions, including intercompany loans.  If our utility subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or advance funds to us as a result of these conditions, or if the ability of our utility subsidiaries to make dividends or advance funds to us is further restricted, it could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations or pay dividends to our shareholders.We expect to continue our policy of paying regular cash dividends.  However, there is no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on our future earnings, capital requirements, and financial conditions, and are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.  Our operating subsidiaries have certainrestrictions on their ability to transfer funds in the form of dividends or loans to us.  See ""Liquidity and Capital Resources"" within Management's Discussion and Analysis in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these restrictions and their impact on our liquidity.Increasing costs associated with our defined benefit retirement plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.We have multiple defined benefit pension and non-pension postretirement plans that cover certain employees.  Assumptions related to future costs, return on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on our funding requirements related to these plans.  These estimates and assumptionsmay change based on actual return on plan assets, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations.  In addition, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 changed the minimum funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans beginning in 2008.Increasing costs associated with our health care plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.The costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees have increased substantially in recent years.  We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs related to health care plans for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise.  The increasing costs and funding requirements associatedwith our health care plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.  60  An effective system of internal control may not be maintained, leading to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management to make an assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal controls.  Our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of these controls.  During their assessment of these controls, management or our independentauditors may identify areas of weakness in control design or effectiveness, which may lead to the conclusion that a material weakness in internal control exists.  Any control deficiencies we identify in the future could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis, which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports or have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business or access sources of liquidity.We have recorded a substantial amount of goodwill associated with the Aquila Transaction.  Any significant impairment of our goodwill related to these utilities would cause a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net income and shareholders' equity.We had approximately $353.7 million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009.  A substantial portion of the goodwill is related to the Aquila Transaction.  If we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect operations in any of these businesses, wemay be forced to record a non-cash impairment charge, which would reduce our reported assets and net income.  Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.  If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill in the period the determination is made.  Thetesting of goodwill for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions.  These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including future business operating performance, changes in economic, regulatory, industry or market conditions, changes in business operations, changes in competition or changes in technologies.  Any changes in key assumptions, or actual performance compared with key assumptions, aboutour business and its future prospects could affect the fair value of one or more business segments, which may result in an impairment charge.  61 "
9,BKH,BLACK HILLS CORP,2009-03-02,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS  The following risk factors and other risk factors that we discuss in our periodic reports filed with the SEC should be considered for a better understanding of our Company.  These important factors and other matters discussed herein could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking statements. The recent global financial crisis has made the credit markets less accessible and created a shortage of available credit.  We may, therefore, be unable to obtain the financing needed to refinance debt, fund planned capital expenditures or otherwise execute our operating strategy.  Our ability to execute our operating strategy is highly dependent upon our access to capital.  Historically, we have addressed our liquidity needs (including funds required to make scheduled principal and interest payments, refinance debt and fund working capital and planned capital expenditures) with operating cash flow, borrowings under credit facilities, proceeds of debt and equity offerings and proceeds from asset sales.  Our ability to access the capital markets and the costs and terms of available financing depend on many factors, including changes in our credit ratings, changes in the Federal or state regulatory environment affecting energy companies, volatility in commodity or electricity prices and general economic and market conditions.   Recent financial distress within the global economy has caused significant disruption in the credit markets.  Among other things, long-term interest rates on debt securities have increased significantly and the volume of equity and debt security issuances has decreased.  Recent actions taken by the United States government, the Federal Reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies may be insufficient to stabilize these markets.  The longer such conditions persist, the more significant the implications become for us, including the possibility that adequate capital may not be available (or available on reasonable commercial terms) for us to refinance indebtedness remaining under the Acquisition Facility.  In addition, on behalf of Enserco we are seeking to replace the existing uncommitted Enserco Facility with a committed credit line, also secured by Ensercos assets, tomaintain credit support for the purchase and sale of natural gas and crude oil, including the issuance of letters of credit.  If we are unable to timely refinance the Acquisition Facility or further extend its December 29, 2009 maturity date or replace the existing uncommitted Enserco Facility with a committed credit line, or both, we could be required to consider additional measures to conserve or raise capital.  Among other things, alternatives could include deferring portions of our planned capital expenditure program, selling assets, issuing equity, reducing or eliminating our dividend, or curtailing certain business activities, including our marketing operations.  Moreover, if we cannot complete capital conservation or capital raising alternatives at sufficient levels on a timely basis, we may not be able to repay the Acquisition Facility on the December 29, 2009 maturity date.  The failure to consummate these anticipated refinancings, and any actions taken in lieu of suchrefinancings, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, given that we are a holding company and that our utility assets are owned by our subsidiaries, if we are unable to adequately access the credit markets, we could be required to take additional measures designed to ensure that our utility subsidiaries are adequately capitalized to provide safe and reliable service.  Possible additional measures would be evaluated in the context of market conditions then-prevailing, prudent financial management and any applicable regulatory requirements.  42The recent global financial crisis has also increased our counterparty credit risk.  As a consequence of the global financial crisis, the creditworthiness of many of our contractual counterparties (particularly financial institutions) has deteriorated.  As the creditworthiness of our counterparties deteriorates, we face increased exposure to counterparty credit default.  We have established guidelines, controls and limits to manage and mitigate credit risk.  For our energy marketing, production and generation activities, we seek to mitigate our credit risk by conducting a majority of our business with investment grade companies, setting tenor and credit limits commensurate with counterparty financial strength, obtaining netting agreements and securing our credit exposure with less creditworthy counterparties through parent company guarantees, prepayments, letters of credit and other security agreements.  Although we aggressively monitor and evaluate changes in our counterparties credit status and adjust the credit limits based upon changes in the customers creditworthiness, our credit guidelines, controls and limits may not protect us from increasing counterparty credit risk under todays stressed financial conditions.  To the extent the financial crisiscauses our credit exposure to contractual counterparties to increase materially, such increased exposure could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. National and regional economic conditions may cause increased late payments and uncollectible accounts, which would reduce earnings and cash flows.  A prolonged recession may lead to an increase in late payments from retail and commercial utility customers, as well as our non-utility customers (including marketing counterparties).  If late payments and uncollectible accounts increase, earnings and cash flows from our continuing operations may be reduced. We may not be able to effectively integrate the utility operations acquired from Aquila into our existing businesses and operations, or achieve the anticipated results of the Aquila Transaction. We expect the Aquila Transaction to produce various benefits.  Achieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties, such as pending and future rate cases, operational and financial synergies and our ability to receive regulatory approval from the CPUC for our proposed construction of rate-based generation to meet the long-term energy supply needs of our Colorado Electric customers.  We cannot provide assurance that the businesses we acquired from Aquila will be integrated in an efficient and effective manner or that they will be profitable after our integration efforts have been completed.  Our credit ratings could be lowered below investment grade in the future.  If this were to occur, it could impact our access to capital, our cost of capital and our other operating costs. Our issuer credit rating is Baa3 (stable outlook) by Moodys; BBB- (stable outlook) by S&P; and BBB (stable outlook) by Fitch.  Although we believe the IPP Transaction and Aquila Transaction have strengthened our financial profile and creditworthiness, we cannot assure that our credit ratings will not be lowered.  Reduction of our credit ratings could impair our ability to refinance or repay our existing debt (including the Acquisition Facility) and to complete new financings on acceptable terms, or at all.  A downgrade could also result in counterparties requiring us to post additional collateral under existing or new contracts or trades.  In addition, a ratings downgrade would increase our interest expense under some of our existing debt obligations, including borrowings under our credit facilities. 43Regulatory commissions may refuse to approve some or all of the utility rate increases we have requested or may request in the future, or may determine that amounts passed through to customers were not prudently incurred and are, therefore, not recoverable.  Our regulated electricity and natural gas utility operations are subject to cost-of-service regulation and earnings oversight.  This regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of desired earnings levels.  Our rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding.  The rates that we are allowed to charge may or may not match our related costs and allowed return on invested capital at any given time.  While rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that the state public utility commissions will judge all of our costs, including our borrowing and debt service costs, to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates aredetermined will always result in rates that produce a full recovery of our costs and the return on invested capital allowed by the applicable state public utility commission.  To some degree, each of our gas and electric utilities in South Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, Iowa and Kansas are permitted to recover certain costs (such as increased fuel and purchased power costs, as applicable) without having to file a rate case.  To the extent we pass through such costs to our customers and a state public utility commission subsequently determines that such costs should not have been paid by the customers, we may be required to refund such costs.  Any such costs not recovered through rates, or any such refund, could negatively affect our revenues, cash flows and results of operations. We could incur additional and substantial write-downs of the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties, which would adversely impact our earnings. We review the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties under the full cost accounting rules of the SEC on a quarterly basis.  This quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test.  Under the ceiling test, capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues (adjusted for cash flow hedges) less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects.  In calculating future net revenues, current spot prices and costs, as of the end of the appropriate quarterly period, are used.  Such prices and costs are utilized except when different prices and costs are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts.  Two primary factors in the ceiling test are natural gasand oil reserve levels and current spot oil and gas prices, both of which impact the present value of estimated future net revenues.  Revisions to estimates of natural gas and oil reserves, or an increase or decrease in prices, can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues.  Any excess of the net book value, less deferred income taxes, is generally written off as an expense. We recorded non-cash impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the full cost ceiling limitations in an amount of $59.0 million after-tax and we may have to record additional non-cash impairment charges in 2009 if current commodity prices persist.  See Note 12 to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The SEC recently adopted new reporting and accounting requirements for oil and gas companies that will change the way we test for potential ceiling test impairments (i.e., testing will be based on 12-month average commodity prices rather than a single date spot price as of the test date).  The new requirements are effective January 1, 2010 and are proposed to apply to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2009. We have deferred a substantial amount of gain associated with the assets sold in the IPP Transaction.  If the Internal Revenue Service successfully challenges this deferral, our results of operations, financial position or liquidity could be adversely affected. We expect to defer tax payments of approximately $185 million as a result of the IPP Transaction and the Aquila Transaction.  We cannot be certain that the IRS will accept our position.  If the IRS successfully sought to assert a contrary position, we could be required to pay a significant amount of these deferred taxes earlier than currently forecasted. 44Estimates of the quantity and value of our proved oil and gas reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves. There are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and their values.  The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves requires interpretation of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors.  Significant inaccuracies in interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.  The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretations and judgment, and the assumptions used regarding quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves, future capital expenditures and prices for oil and natural gas.  Actual prices, production, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary from those assumed in our estimates.  These variances may besignificant.  Any significant variance from the assumptions used could cause the actual quantity of our reserves, and future net cash flow, to be materially different from our estimates.  In addition, results of drilling, testing and production, changes in future capital expenditures and fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices after the date of the estimate may result in substantial upward or downward revisions.  The SEC has proposed revised reporting guidelines for reserves that will apply to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2009, however there is the possibility of delaying the compliance date until the FASB has issued final accounting standards in line with the revised SEC rules.  Key revisions include changes to the oil and gas pricing used to estimate reserves, the use of new technology for determining reserves and authorization for optional disclosure of probable and possible reserves. Estimates of the quality and quantity of our coal reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in three dimensional structural modeling. There are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of coal reserves.  The process of coal volume estimation requires interpretations of drill hole log data and subsequent computer modeling of the intersected deposit.  Significant inaccuracies in interpretation or modeling could materially affect the quantity and quality of our reserve estimates.  The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment of known data, assumptions used regarding structural limits and mining extents, conditions encountered during actual reserve recovery and undetected deposit anomalies.  Variance from the assumptions used and drill hole modeling density could result in additions or deletions from our volume estimates. In addition, future environmental, economic or geologic changes may occur or become known that require reserve revisions either upward or downward fromprior reserve estimates. Our current or future development, expansion and acquisition activities may not be successful, which could impair our ability to execute our growth strategy. Execution of our future growth plan is dependent on successful ongoing and future acquisition, development and expansion activities.  We can provide no assurance that we will be able to complete acquisitions or development projects we undertake or continue to develop attractive opportunities for growth.  Factors that could cause our activities to be unsuccessful include:       Our inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals;           Our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all;           The possibility that one or more rating agencies would downgrade our issuer credit rating to below investment grade, thus increasing our cost of doing business;           Our inability to successfully integrate any businesses we acquire;           Our inability to retain management or other key personnel;           Our inability to negotiate acceptable acquisition, construction, fuel supply, power sales or other material agreements;       45       The trend of utilities building their own generation or looking for developers to develop and build projects for sale to utilities under turnkey arrangements;           Lower than anticipated increases in the demand for power in our target markets;           Changes in federal, state, local or tribal laws and regulations;           Fuel prices or fuel supply constraints;           Pipeline capacity and transmission constraints; and           Competition.   We can provide no assurance that results from any acquisition will conform to our expectations.  There may be additional risks associated with the operation of any newly acquired assets. Successful acquisitions are subject to a number of uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control.  Factors which may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected results include:       Delay in, and restrictions imposed as part of, any required governmental or regulatory approvals;           The loss of management or other key personnel;           The diversion of our managements attention from other business segments; and           Integration and operational issues.   Construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve significant risks which could reduce revenues or increase expenses. The construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve many risks, including:       The inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals;           Contract restrictions upon the timing of scheduled outages;           Cost of supplying or securing replacement power during scheduled and unscheduled outages;           The unavailability or increased cost of equipment and labor supply;           Supply interruptions, work stoppages and labor disputes;           Capital and operating costs to comply with increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations;           Opposition by members of public or special-interest groups;            Weather interferences;            Unexpected engineering, environmental and geological problems; and           Unanticipated cost overruns.    46The ongoing operation of our facilities involves many of the risks described above, in addition to risks relating to the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency.  New plants may employ recently developed and technologically complex equipment, including newer environmental emission control technology.  Any of these risks could cause us to operate below expected capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues, increase expenses or cause us to incur higher maintenance costs and penalties.  While we maintain insurance, obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance and our rights under warranties or performance guarantees may not be timely or adequate to cover lost revenues, increased expenses or liquidated damage payments. Our operating results can be adversely affected by milder weather.  Our utility businesses are seasonal businesses and weather patterns can have a material impact on our operating performance.  Demand for electricity is typically greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating, and demand for natural gas is extremely sensitive to winter weather effects on heating requirements.  Because natural gas is heavily used for residential and commercial heating, the demand for this product depends heavily upon winter weather patterns throughout our service territory and a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating seasons.  Accordingly, our utility operations have historically generated lower revenues and income when weather conditions are cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter.  Unusually mild summers and winters therefore could have an adverse effect on our financial condition andresults of operations. Because prices for our products and services and operating costs for our business are volatile, our revenues and expenses may fluctuate. A substantial portion of our net income in recent years was attributable to sales of wholesale electricity and natural gas into a robust market.  Energy prices are influenced by many factors outside our control, including, among other things, fuel prices, transmission constraints, supply and demand, weather, general economic conditions, and the rules, regulations and actions of system operators in those markets.  Moreover, unlike most other commodities, electricity cannot be stored and therefore must be produced concurrently with its use.  As a result, wholesale power markets are subject to significant, unpredictable price fluctuations over relatively short periods of time. The success of our oil and gas operations is affected by the prevailing market prices of oil and natural gas.  Oil and natural gas prices and markets historically have also been, and are likely to continue to be, volatile.  A decrease in oil or natural gas prices would not only reduce revenues and profits, but would also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable, and may result in charges to earnings for impairment of the net capitalized cost of these assets.  Oil and natural gas prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control.  A decline in oil and natural gas price volatility could also affect our revenues and returns from Energy Marketing, which historically tend to increase when markets are volatile. Our mining operation requires a reliable supply of replacement parts, explosives, fuel, tires and steel-related products.  If the cost of any of these increase significantly, or if a source of these supplies or mining equipment was unavailable to meet our replacement demands, our profitability could be lower than our current expectations.  In recent years, industry-wide demand growth has exceeded supply growth for certain surface mining equipment and off-the-road tires.  As a result, lead times for some items have generally increased to several months and prices for these items have increased significantly. 47Our hedging activities that are designed to protect against commodity price and financial market risks may cause fluctuations in reported financial results. We use various contracts and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, to manage commodity price and financial market risks.  The timing of the recognition of gains or losses on these economic hedges in accordance with GAAP does not always match up with the gains or losses on the items being hedged.  The difference in accounting can result in volatility in reported results, even though the expected profit margin may be essentially unchanged from the dates the transactions were consummated. Our use of derivative financial instruments could result in material financial losses.  From time to time, we have sought to limit a portion of the adverse effects resulting from changes in natural gas and crude oil commodity prices, and interest and foreign exchange rates by using derivative financial instruments and other hedging mechanisms and by the activities we conduct in our trading operations.  To the extent that we hedge our commodity price and interest rate exposures, we forego the benefits we would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in our favor.  In addition, even though monitored by management, our hedging and trading activities can result in losses.  Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the hedge arrangement, the hedge is economically imperfect, commodity prices or interest rates move unfavorably related to our physical or financial positions, or hedging policiesand procedures are not followed. Our Energy Marketing and Utility operations rely on storage and transportation assets owned by third parties to satisfy their obligations. Our energy marketing operations involve contracts to buy and sell natural gas, crude oil and other commodities, many of which are settled by physical delivery.  We depend on pipelines and other storage and transportation facilities owned by third parties to satisfy our delivery obligations under these contracts.  Our Gas Utilities also rely on pipeline companies and other owners of gas storage facilities to deliver natural gas to ratepayers and to hedge commodity costs.  If storage capacity is inadequate or transportation is disrupted, our ability to satisfy our obligations may be hindered.  As a result, we may be responsible for damages incurred by our counterparties, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at then-current market rates, or for penalties imposed by state regulatory authorities. Our business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and permitting requirements as well as environmental liabilities, including those we assumed in connection with certain acquisitions.  We may be adversely affected if we fail to achieve or maintain compliance with existing or future regulations or requirements, or by the potentially high cost of complying with such requirements or addressing environmental liabilities. Our business is subject to extensive energy, environmental and other laws and regulations of federal, state, tribal and local authorities.  We generally must obtain and comply with a variety of licenses, permits and other approvals in order to operate, which can require significant capital expenditure and operating costs.  If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to civil or criminal liability and the imposition of penalties, liens or fines, claims for property damage or personal injury, or environmental clean-up costs.  In addition, existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted, and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities, which could require additional unexpected expenditures and have a detrimental effect on our business. In connection with certain acquisitions, we assumed liabilities associated with the environmental condition of certain properties, regardless of when such liabilities arose, whether known or unknown, and in some cases agreed to indemnify the former owners of those properties for environmental liabilities.  Future steps to bring our facilities into compliance or to address contamination from legacy operations, if necessary, could be expensive and could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.  We expect our environmental compliance expenditures to be substantial in the future due to the continuing trends toward stricter standards, greater regulation, more extensive permitting requirements and an increase in the number of assets we operate. 48Federal and state laws concerning climate change and air emissions, including emission reduction mandates and renewable energy portfolio standards, may materially increase our generation and production costs and could render some of our generating units uneconomical to operate and maintain. We own and operate regulated and non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants in South Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado and Idaho.  We are constructing another fossil-fuel generating plant in Wyoming.  Air emissions of fossil-fuel generating plants are subject to federal, state and tribal regulation.  Recent changes in federal and state laws governing air emissions from fossil-fuel generating plants will result in more stringent emission limitations.  As the issue of climate change, particularly with respect to CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions by fossil-fuel generating plants, receives increased attention, additional or more stringent emission limitations or other requirements could be imposed.  These limitations or other requirements could require us to incur significant additional costs relating to, among other things, the installation of additional emission control equipment, the acceleration ofcapital expenditures, the purchase of additional emissions allowances or offsets and the closure of certain generating facilities.  To the extent our regulated fossil-fuel generating plants are included in rate base, we will attempt to recover costs associated with complying with emission standards or other requirements.  We will also attempt to recover the emission compliance costs of our non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants from utility and other purchasers of the power generated by our non-regulated power plants.  Any unrecovered costs could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, future changes in environmental regulations governing air emissions could render some of our power generating units more expensive or uneconomical to operate and maintain. We own electric utilities that serve customers in Colorado, Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming.  To varying degrees, Colorado and Montana have each adopted mandatory renewable portfolio standards that require electric utilities to supply a minimum percentage of the power delivered to customers from renewable resources (e.g., wind, solar, biomass) by a certain date in the future.  These renewable energy portfolio standards have increased the power supply costs of our electric operations.  If these states increase their renewable energy portfolio standards, or if similar standards are imposed by the other states in which we operate electric utilities, our power supply costs will further increase.  Although we will seek to recover these higher costs in rates, any unrecovered costs could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Governmental authorities may assess penalties on us if it is determined that we have not complied with environmental laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond our control, that failure may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines against us.  Recent lawsuits by the EPA and various states filed against others within industries in which we operate, including enforcement actions under the EPAs New Source Review rule, highlight the environmental risks faced by generating facilities, in general, and coal-fired generating facilities in particular. Our energy production, transmission and distribution activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs. Inherent in our natural gas distribution activities, as well as our production, transportation and storage of crude oil and natural gas and our coal mining operations, are a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, blow-outs, fires, releases of hazardous materials, explosions and mechanical problems that could cause substantial adverse financial impacts.  These events could result in injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property or natural resources (including public parks), environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, and substantial losses to us.  In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses.  The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations.  Particularly for our distribution lineslocated near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering areas, the damages resulting from any such events could be great. 49Increased risks of regulatory penalties could negatively impact our business. EPA 2005 increased FERCs civil penalty authority for violation of FERC statutes, rules and orders.  FERC can now impose penalties of $1.0 million per violation, per day.  Many rules that were historically subject to voluntary compliance are now mandatory and subject to potential civil penalties for violations.  If a serious violation did occur, and penalties were imposed by FERC, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations or our financial results. Ongoing changes in the United States electric utility industry, including state and federal regulatory changes, a potential increase in the number or geographic scale of our competitors or the imposition of price limitations to address market volatility, could adversely affect our profitability. The United States electric utility industry is experiencing increasing competitive pressures as a result of:       EPA 2005 and the repeal of the PUHCA;            Industry consolidation;           Consumer demands;            Transmission constraints;            Renewable resource supply requirements;            Technological advances; and           Greater availability of natural gas-fired power generation, and other factors.   FERC has implemented and continues to propose regulatory changes to increase access to the nationwide transmission grid by utility and non-utility purchasers and sellers of electricity.  In addition, a limited number of states have implemented or are considering or currently implementing methods to introduce and promote retail competition.  Industry deregulation in some states led to the disaggregation of vertically integrated utilities into separate generation, transmission and distribution businesses.  Deregulation initiatives in a number of states may encourage further disaggregation.  As a result, significant additional competitors could become active in the generation, transmission and distribution segments of our industry, which could negatively affect our ability to expand our asset base. In addition, the independent system operators who oversee many of the wholesale power markets have in the past imposed, and may in the future continue to impose, price limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets.  These price limitations and other mechanisms may adversely affect the profitability of generating facilities that sell energy into the wholesale power markets.  Given the extreme volatility and lack of meaningful long-term price history in some of these markets, and the imposition of price limitations by independent system operators, we may not be able to operate profitably in all wholesale power markets. We rely on cash distributions from our subsidiaries to make and maintain dividends and debt payments.  Our subsidiaries may not be able or permitted to make dividend payments or loan funds to us. We are a holding company.  Our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets.  Our operating cash flow and ability to service our indebtedness depend on the operating cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends or advances.  Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available for that purpose, whether by dividends or otherwise.  In addition, each subsidiarys ability to pay dividends to us depends on any applicable contractual or regulatory restrictions that may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of cash, working capital or debt service funds.  50Our utility operations are regulated by state utility commissions in Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wyoming.  In connection with the Aquila Transaction, the settlement agreements or acquisition orders approved by the CPUC, NPSC, IUB and KCC provide that, among other things, (i) our utilities in those jurisdictions cannot pay dividends if they have issued debt to third parties and the payment of a dividend would reduce their equity ratio to below 40% of their total capitalization; and (ii) neither Black Hills Utility Holdings nor any of its utility subsidiaries can extend credit to us except in the ordinary course of business and upon reasonable terms consistent with market terms.  In addition to the restrictions described above, each state in which we conduct utility operations imposes restrictions on affiliate transactions, including intercompany loans.  If our utilitysubsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or advance funds to us as a result of these conditions, or if the ability of our utility subsidiaries to make dividends or advance funds to us is further restricted, it could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations or pay dividends to our shareholders. Increasing costs associated with our defined benefit retirement plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.  We have multiple defined benefit pension and non-pension postretirement plans that cover a substantial portion of our employees.  Assumptions related to future costs, return on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on our funding requirements related to these plans.  These estimates and assumptions may change based on actual return on plan assets, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations.  In addition, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 changed the minimum funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans beginning in 2008.  Increasing costs associated with health care plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. The costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees have increased substantially in recent years.  We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs related to health care plans for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise.  The increasing costs and funding requirements associated with our health care plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. An effective system of internal control may not be maintained, leading to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management to make an assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal controls.  Our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of these controls.  During their assessment of these controls, management or our independent auditors may identify areas of weakness in control design or effectiveness, which may lead to the conclusion that a material weakness in internal control exists.  Any control deficiencies we identify in the future could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis, which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports or have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business or access sources of liquidity. 51We have recorded a substantial amount of goodwill associated with the Aquila Transaction.  Any significant impairment of our goodwill would cause a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net income and shareholders equity.  We had approximately $359 million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008.  A substantial portion of the goodwill is related to the Aquila Transaction.  If we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect operations in any of these businesses, we may be forced to record an impairment charge, which would decrease assets and reduce net income.  Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.  If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill in the period the determination is made.  The testing of goodwill for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performanceand cash flows, as well as other assumptions.  These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including future business operating performance, changes in economic, regulatory, industry or market conditions, changes in business operations, changes in competition or changes in technologies.  Any changes in key assumptions, or actual performance compared with key assumptions, about our business and its future prospects could affect the fair value of one or more business segments, which may result in an impairment charge. "
10,BKH,BLACK HILLS CORP,2008-02-29,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS  The following specific risk factors and other risk factors that we discuss in our periodic reports filed with the SEC should be considered for a better understanding of our Company.  These important factors and other matters discussed herein could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements included elsewhere in this document. We have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire utility assets from Aquila.  There are many risks associated with our ability to complete the transaction and subsequently achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisition. We may not be able to obtain the approvals required to complete the acquisition or, in order to do so, we may be required to comply with material restrictions or conditions. Our acquisition of the utility assets is subject to approvals from the FERC and various utility regulatory, antitrust and other authorities in the United States.  Several approvals were received during 2007.  As we proceed to obtain the remaining approvals, these governmental authorities may impose conditions on the completion, or require changes to the terms of the acquisition, including restrictions or conditions on the business, operations, or financial performance of the gas utilities and electric utility that we would acquire from Aquila, following completion of the acquisition.  These conditions or changes could impose additional costs on us or limit our revenues following the acquisition, or may impose unacceptable conditions on our operation of the gas utilities and electric utility assets, which could delay the completion of or cause us to abandon our acquisition. In addition, the participating financial institution commitments to fund our $1.0 billion acquisition facility expire on August 5, 2008, and the facility terminates on February 5, 2009.  Delays that prevent the closing of the acquisition prior to August 5, 2008 could require us to find replacement financing, for which we may incur a substantial amount of additional financing-related costs.  If we were unable to find acceptable replacement financing, it could cause us to abandon our acquisition. If we do not complete the acquisition, we will still incur and remain liable for significant transaction costs, including legal, accounting, financial advisory, filing, printing and other related costs. If completed, we may not be able to effectively integrate the utility operations we acquire into our existing businesses and operations, or achieve the intended results. We expect that the acquisition will result in various benefits.  Achieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties.  We cannot provide assurance that the gas utilities and the electric utility businesses we would acquire from Aquila can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner, or that once integrated; they will prove to be profitable. We will be subject to business uncertainties while the acquisition is pending that could adversely affect our financial results. Uncertainty about the effect of the acquisition on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on us.  Although we have taken steps designed to eliminate or at least reduce any adverse effects, these uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the acquisition is completed and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with us to change existing business relationships. 33Employee retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging prior to the completion of the acquisition, as employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the addition of the gas utilities and electric utility we would acquire from Aquila.  If, despite our retention and recruitment efforts, key employees depart or fail to accept employment with us because of issues relating to uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with us, our financial results could be negatively affected. Our credit ratings could be lowered below investment grade in the future.  If this were to occur, it could impact our access to capital, our cost of capital and our other operating costs, which could adversely affect our ability to complete the acquisition. Our issuer credit rating is Baa3, with a negative outlook by Moodys and BBB-, with a stable outlook by S&P.  While we do not expect any negative effect on our credit rating from our proposed acquisition of the utility assets, we cannot provide assurance that our credit ratings will not be lowered as a result of the proposed acquisition or for any other reason, including the failure to consummate the acquisition of the utility assets.  Any reduction in our ratings by Moodys or S&P would reduce our credit rating with that agency to non-investment grade status, and could adversely affect our ability to complete the Aquila transaction, to refinance or repay our existing debt and to complete new financings on acceptable terms or at all. Our utilities may not raise their retail rates without prior approval of the SDPUC, the WPSC and the MTPSC.  If either utility seeks rate relief, it could experience delays, reduced or partial rate recovery, or disallowances in rate proceedings. Because our utilities are generally unable to increase their base rates without prior approval from the SDPUC, the WPSC, and the MTPSC, our returns could be threatened by plant outages, machinery failure, increased purchased power costs, acts of nature, acts of terrorism or other unexpected events over which our utilities have no control that could cause operating costs to increase and operating margins to decline.  While we have cost pass-through mechanisms in place that allow recovery of increased costs related to fuel, purchased power, transmission and natural gas, there is no guarantee that all increases in these costs will be recovered.  Additionally, our utilities general operating costs and investments are subject to the review of the SDPUC, the WPSC and the MTPSC.  These commissions could find certain costs or investments are not prudent and not recoverable in our rates, thus negatively affectingour revenues. Estimates of the quantity and value of our proved oil and gas reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves. There are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and their values.  The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves requires interpretation of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors.  Significant inaccuracies in interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.  The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretations and judgment, and the assumptions used regarding quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves, future capital expenditures and prices for oil and natural gas.  Actual prices, production, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will vary from those assumed in our estimates.  These variances may besignificant.  Any significant variance from the assumptions used could cause the actual quantity of our reserves, and future net cash flow to be materially different from our estimates.  In addition, results of drilling, testing and production, changes in future capital expenditures and fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices after the date of the estimate may result in substantial upward or downward revisions. 34Our current or future development, expansion and acquisition activities may not be successful, which could impair our ability to execute our growth strategy. Execution of our future growth plan is dependent on successful ongoing and future acquisition, development and expansion activities.  We can provide no assurance that we will be able to complete acquisitions or development projects we undertake or continue to develop attractive opportunities for growth.  Factors that could cause our activities to be unsuccessful include:      our inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals;       our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all;       the possibility that one or more rating agencies would downgrade our issuer credit rating to below investment grade, thus increasing our cost of doing business;       capital market conditions;       our inability to successfully integrate any businesses we acquire;       our inability to negotiate acceptable acquisition, construction, fuel supply, power sales or other material agreements;       the trend of utilities building their own generation or looking for developers to develop and build projects for sale to utilities under turnkey arrangements;       lower than anticipated increases in the demand for power in our target markets;       changes in federal, state, local or tribal laws and regulations;       fuel prices or fuel supply constraints;       transmission constraints; and       competition.   We can provide no assurance that results from any acquisition will conform to our expectations.  There may be additional risks associated with the operation of any newly acquired assets. Successful acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control and are inherently uncertain.  Factors which may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected results include:      delay in, and restrictions imposed as part of any required governmental or regulatory approvals;       the loss of management or other key personnel;       the diversion of our managements attention from other business segments; and       integration and operational issues.   Our credit ratings could be lowered below investment grade in the future.  If this were to occur, our access to capital and our cost of capital and other costs would be negatively affected. Our issuer credit rating is Baa3, with a negative outlook by Moodys, and BBB-, with a stable outlook by S&P.  Any reduction in our ratings by Moodys or S&P would reduce our credit rating with that agency to non-investment grade status, which could adversely affect our ability to refinance or repay our existing debt or complete new financings on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, a downgrade in our credit rating would increase our interest expense under some of our existing debt obligations, including borrowings made under our credit agreements and the $1.0 billion acquisition facility. A downgrade could also result in our business counterparties requiring us to provide additional amounts of collateral under existing or new transactions. 35Construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve significant risks which could reduce revenues or increase expenses. The construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource extraction facilities involve many risks, including:      the inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals;       contract restrictions upon the timing of scheduled outages;       cost of supplying or securing replacement power during scheduled and unscheduled outages;       the unavailability or increased cost of equipment and labor supply;       supply interruptions;       work stoppages;       labor disputes;       costs to comply with future environmental laws and regulations;       opposition by members of public or special-interest groups;       weather interferences;       unforeseen engineering, environmental and geological problems; and       unanticipated cost overruns.   The ongoing operation of our facilities involves all of the risks described above, in addition to risks relating to the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency.  New plants may employ recently developed and technologically complex equipment, especially in the case of newer environmental emission control technology.  Any of these risks could cause us to operate below expected capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues, increase expenses, or cause us to incur higher maintenance costs and penalties.  While we maintain insurance, obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance and our rights under warranties or performance guarantees may not be timely or adequate to cover lost revenues, increased expenses or liquidated damage payments. Because prices for our products and services and operating costs for our business are volatile, our revenues and expenses may fluctuate. A substantial portion of our net income in recent years was attributable to sales of wholesale electricity and natural gas into a robust market.  Energy prices are influenced by many factors outside our control, including:      fuel prices;       transmission constraints;       supply and demand;       weather;       economic conditions; and       the rules, regulations and actions of the system operators in those markets.   Moreover, unlike most other commodities, electricity cannot be stored and therefore must be produced concurrently with its use.  As a result, wholesale power markets are subject to significant, unpredictable price fluctuations over relatively short periods of time. 36The success of our oil and gas operations is affected by the prevailing market prices of oil and natural gas.  Oil and natural gas prices and markets historically have also been, and are likely to continue to be, volatile.  A decrease in oil or natural gas prices would not only reduce revenues and profits, but would also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable, and may result in charges to earnings for impairment of the net capitalized cost of these assets.  Oil and natural gas prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control.  A decline in fuel price volatility could also affect our revenues and returns from energy marketing, which historically tend to increase when markets are volatile. Our mining operation requires a reliable supply of replacement parts, explosives, fuel, tires and steel-related products.  If the cost of any of these increase significantly, or if a source of these supplies or mining equipment was unavailable to meet our replacement demands, our profitability could be lower than our current expectations.  In recent years, industry-wide demand growth has exceeded supply growth for certain surface mining equipment and off-the-road tires.  As a result, lead times for some items have generally increased to several months. Our hedging activities that are designed to protect against commodity price and financial market risks may cause fluctuations in reported financial results and our stock price could be adversely affected as a result. We use various contracts and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, to manage commodity price and financial market risks.  The timing of the recognition of gains or losses on these economic hedges in accordance with GAAP does not always match up with the gains or losses on the items being hedged.  The difference in accounting can result in volatility in reported results, even though the expected profit margin is essentially unchanged from the dates the transactions were consummated. Our energy marketing subsidiary relies on storage and transportation assets that we do not own or control to deliver natural gas and crude oil. The commodity, storage and transportation portfolios at our energy marketing operations consist of contracts to buy and sell natural gas and crude oil commodities, many of which are settled by physical delivery. We depend on pipelines and other storage and transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver these commodities to satisfy contractual commitments.  If transportation is disrupted, or if storage capacity is inadequate, including for reasons of force majeure, our ability to fulfill our commitments may be hindered.  As a result, we may be responsible for damages incurred by our counterparties, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at then-current market rates. Our business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and permitting requirements as well as on-site environmental liabilities we assumed when we acquired some of our facilities.  We may be adversely affected by any future inability to comply with existing or future regulations or requirements, or the potentially high cost of complying with such requirements. Our business is subject to extensive energy, environmental and other laws and regulations of federal, state, tribal and local authorities.  We generally must obtain and comply with a variety of licenses, permits and other approvals in order to operate.  In the course of complying with these requirements, we may incur significant additional costs.  If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to civil or criminal liability and the imposition of liens or fines.  In addition, existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted, new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities, which could have a detrimental effect on our business. 37In acquiring some of our facilities, we assumed on-site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of those facilities, regardless of when such liabilities arose, whether known or unknown, and in some cases agreed to indemnify the former owners of those facilities for on-site environmental liabilities.  We strive to comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.  Future steps to bring our facilities into compliance, if necessary, could be expensive, and could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.  We expect our environmental expenditures to be substantial in the future due to the continuing trends toward stricter standards, greater regulation, more extensive permitting requirements and an increase in the assets we operate. Federal and/or State requirements imposing further emission reduction mandates, including limitations on CO2 emissions, could make some of our electric generating units uneconomical to maintain and operate. Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury and particulates from fossil-fueled generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulations, controls and mitigation expenses.  The issue of global climate change is receiving increased attention with a strong focus on CO2 emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change.  There is considerable debate regarding the public policy approach that the United States should follow to address this issue.  Although several bills have been introduced in Congress that would compel CO2 emission reductions, none have been enacted into law.  Future changes in environmental regulations governing these pollutants could make some of our electric generating units more expensive or uneconomical to maintain and operate.  In addition, any legal obligation that would require us to substantially reduce our emissionsbelow present levels could require extensive mitigation efforts and, in the case of CO2 legislation, may raise uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels, particularly coal, as an energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities. Governmental authorities may assess penalties on us if it is determined that we have not complied with environmental laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond our control, that failure may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines against us.  Recent lawsuits by the EPA and various states filed against others within industries in which we operate, highlight the environmental risks faced by generating facilities, in general, and coal-fired generating facilities in particular. Our natural gas distribution activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs. Inherent in our natural gas distribution activities are a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, explosions and mechanical problems that could cause substantial adverse financial impacts.  In addition, these risks could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, and substantial losses to us.  In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses.  The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations.  For our distribution lines located near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering areas, the level of damages resulting from these risks could be greater.  If we are able tocomplete the pending Aquila acquisition, our natural gas distribution activities will expand greatly. Increased risks of regulatory penalties could negatively impact our business. EPA 2005 increased FERCs civil penalty authority for violation of FERC statutes, rules and orders.  FERC can now impose penalties of $1.0 million per violation, per day.  Many rules that were historically subject to voluntary compliance are now mandatory and subject to potential civil penalties for violations.  If a serious violation did occur, and penalties were imposed by FERC, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial results of operations.  38Our agreements with counterparties expose us to the risk of counterparty default, which could adversely affect our cash flow and profitability. We are exposed to credit risks in our business operations.  Credit risk includes the risk that counterparties that owe us money or energy will breach their obligations.  In the past several years, a substantial number of energy companies have experienced downgrades in their credit ratings, some of which occasionally serve as our counterparties.  In addition, we have project level financing arrangements that provide for the potential acceleration of payment obligations in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty under related power purchase agreements.  If these or other counterparties fail to perform their obligations under their respective power purchase agreements, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.  We may not be able to enter into replacement power purchase agreements on terms as favorable as our existing agreements, or at all.  If we were unable to enter intoreplacement power purchase agreements, we would attempt to sell the plants power at prevailing market prices. Estimates of the quality and quantity of our coal reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in three dimensional structural modeling. There are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of coal reserves.  The process of coal volume estimation requires interpretations of drill hole log data and subsequent computer modeling of the intersected deposit.  Significant inaccuracies in interpretation or modeling could materially affect the quantity and quality of our reserves.  The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment of known data, assumptions used regarding structural limits and mining extents, conditions encountered during actual reserve recovery, and undetected deposit anomalies.  Variance from the assumptions used and drill hole modeling density could result in additions or deletions from our volume estimates.  In addition, future environmental, economic or geologic changes may occur or become known that require reserve revisions either upward or downward from priorreserve estimates. Ongoing changes in the United States utility industry, including state and federal regulatory changes, a potential increase in the number or geographic scale of our competitors or the imposition of price limitations to address market volatility, could adversely affect our profitability. The United States electric utility industry is experiencing increasing competitive pressures as a result of:      EPA 2005 and the repeal of PUHCA;       industry consolidation;       consumer demands;       transmission constraints;       renewable resource supply requirements;       technological advances; and       greater availability of natural gas-fired power generation, and other factors.   FERC has implemented and continues to propose regulatory changes to increase access to the nationwide transmission grid by utility and non-utility purchasers and sellers of electricity.  In addition, a number of states have implemented or are considering or currently implementing methods to introduce and promote retail competition.  Industry deregulation in some states led to the disaggregation of vertically integrated utilities into separate generation, transmission and distribution businesses.  Deregulation initiatives in a number of states may encourage further disaggregation.  As a result, significant additional competitors could become active in the generation, transmission and distribution segments of our industry, which could negatively affect our ability to expand our asset base. In addition, the independent system operators who oversee many of the wholesale power markets have in the past imposed, and may in the future continue to impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets.  These price limitations and other mechanisms may adversely affect the profitability of generating facilities that sell energy into the wholesale power markets.  Given the extreme volatility and lack of meaningful long-term price history in some of these markets, and the imposition of price limitations by independent system operators, we may not be able to operate profitably in all wholesale power markets. 39We must rely on cash distributions from our subsidiaries to make and maintain dividends and debt payments.  There may be changes in the regulatory environment that restrict future dividends from our subsidiaries. We are a holding company, so investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets.  Our operating cash flow and ability to service our indebtedness depend on the operating cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends or advances.  Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available for that purpose, whether by dividends or otherwise.  In addition, each subsidiarys ability to pay dividends to us depends on any applicable contractual or regulatory restrictions that may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of cash, working capital or debt service funds.   Our utility operations are regulated by utility commissions in the States of South Dakota, Wyoming and Montana.  These commissions generally possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of the utility customers are being met and that we maintain a reasonable capital structure.  Some state utility commissions have imposed restrictions on the ability of the utilities they regulate to pay dividends or make advances to their parent holding companies.  If the utility commissions for the states in which we operate adopt similar restrictions, our utilities ability to pay dividends or advance funds to us would be limited, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations or pay dividends to our shareholders. Increasing costs associated with our defined benefit retirement plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.   We have multiple defined benefit pension and non-pension postretirement plans that cover a substantial portion of our employees.  Assumptions related to future costs, return on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on our funding requirements related to these plans.  These estimates and assumptions may change based on actual return on plan assets, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations.  In addition, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 changed the minimum funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans beginning in 2008.  Therefore, our funding requirements may change and additional contributions could be required in the future. Increasing costs associated with health care plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. The costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees have increased substantially in recent years.  We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs related to health care plans for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise.  The increasing costs and funding requirements associated with our health care plans may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. An effective system of internal control may not be maintained, leading to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management to make an assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal controls.  Our independent registered public accounting firm also attests to the effectiveness of these controls.  During their assessment of these controls, management or our independent auditors may identify areas of weakness in control design or effectiveness, which may lead to the conclusion that a material weakness in internal control exists.  40 "
1,BKH,BLACK HILLS CORP,2006-03-16,"ITEM 1A.Risk Factors
  The following specific risk factors and other risk factors that we discuss in our periodic reports filed from time to time with the SEC should be considered for a better understanding of our Company.  These factors and other matters discussed herein are important factors that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements included elsewhere in this document. We must rely on cash distributions from our subsidiaries to make and maintain dividends and debt payments.  There may be changes in the regulatory environment that restrict future dividends from our subsidiaries. We are a holding company and thus our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets.  Consequently, our operating cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness depend on the operating cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends or advances.  Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available for that purpose, whether by dividends or otherwise.  In addition, each subsidiarys ability to pay dividends to us depends on any contractual or regulatory restrictions that may be applicable to it, which may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of cash, working capital or debt service funds. 26   Our utility operations are regulated by utility commissions in the States of South Dakota, Wyoming and Montana.  These commissions generally possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of the utility customers are being met and that we maintain a reasonable capital structure.  As a result of the energy crisis in California and the financial troubles at a number of energy companies, some state utility commissions have imposed restrictions on the ability of the utilities they regulate to pay dividends or make advances to their parent holding companies.  If the utility commissions in South Dakota or Wyoming choose to adopt similar restrictions, our utilities ability to pay dividends or advance funds to us would be limited, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations.  We cannot assure you that our results from any acquisition will conform to our expectations.  There may be additional risks associated with the operation of any new acquisition. Successful acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control and are inherently uncertain.  Factors which may cause our actual results to differ materially from our expected results include:      delay in any required governmental or regulatory approvals;       the loss of management or key personnel;       the diversion of our managements attention from other business segments; and       integration and operational issues.   Our agreements with counterparties that have experienced downgrades in their credit ratings expose us to the risk of counterparty default, which could adversely affect our cash flow and profitability. We are exposed to credit risks in our power generation, distribution and energy marketing operations.  Credit risk includes the risk that counterparties that owe us money or energy will breach their obligations.  In the past several years, a substantial number of energy companies have experienced downgrades in their credit ratings, some of which serve as our counterparties from time to time.  In addition, we have project level financing arrangements in place that provide for the potential acceleration of payment obligations in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty under related power purchase agreements.  If these or other counterparties fail to perform their obligations under their respective power purchase agreements, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.  We may not be able to enter into replacement power purchase agreements on terms as favorable as ourexisting agreements, or at all.  If we were unable to enter into replacement power purchase agreements, we would sell the plants power at market prices. Our credit ratings could be lowered below investment grade in the future.  If this were to occur, our access to capital and our cost of capital and other costs would be negatively affected. Our issuer credit rating is Baa3 by Moodys Investor Services, Inc., or Moodys, and BBB- by Standard & Poors Rating Service.  Any reduction in our ratings by Moodys or Standard & Poors would reduce our credit rating with that agency to non-investment grade status, and such reduction could adversely affect our ability to refinance or repay our existing debt and to complete new financings on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, a downgrade in our credit rating would increase our costs of borrowing under some of our existing debt obligations, including borrowings made under our revolving credit facility, our $128.3 million Wygen I plant project financing, and our $26.2 million General Electric Capital Corp. secured financings.   A downgrade could also result in our business counterparties requiring us to provide additional amounts of collateral under existing or new transactions.  27   Geopolitical tensions may impair our ability to raise capital and limit our growth. Continuing conflict in Iraq and tensions between the United States and other governments could disrupt capital markets and make it more costly or temporarily impossible for us to raise capital, thus hampering the implementation of our stated strategy.  In the past, geopolitical events, including the uncertainty associated with the Gulf War in 1991 and the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, have been associated with general economic slowdowns.  Geopolitical tensions or other factors could retard economic growth and reduce demand for the power and fuel products that we produce or market, which could adversely affect our earnings. Our utilities may not raise their retail rates without prior approval of the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission or the Wyoming Public Services Commission.  If either utility seeks rate relief, it could experience delays in obtaining approvals and could have rate recovery disallowed in rate proceedings. Our rate freeze agreement with the SDPUC for our Black Hills Power electric utility expired on January 1, 2005.  Until such time as we petition the SDPUC or the WPSC for rate relief, or either commission requires that we do so, neither Black Hills Power nor Cheyenne Light may increase its retail rates.  Additionally, Black Hills Power may not invoke any fuel and purchased power adjustment tariff that would take effect prior to the completion of a rate proceeding, absent extraordinary circumstances.  As part of the process for obtaining approval to acquire Cheyenne Light, we agreed with the WPSC that Cheyenne Light would not raise retail rates for its customers prior to January 1, 2006.  Because our utilities are generally unable to increase their base rates without prior approval from the SDPUC and the WPSC, our returns could be threatened by plant outages, machinery failure, increases in purchased powercosts over which our utilities have no control, acts of nature, acts of terrorism or other unexpected events that could cause operating costs to increase and operating margins to decline.  Moreover, in the event of unexpected plant outages or machinery failures, Black Hills Power may be required to purchase replacement power in wholesale power markets at prices that exceed the rates it is permitted to charge its retail customers.  Finally, our utilities costs would be subject to the review of the SDPUC or the WPSC, and the commissions could find certain costs not to be recoverable, thus negatively affecting our revenues. Because prices for our products and services and other operating costs for our business are volatile, our revenues and expenses may fluctuate. A substantial portion of our net income in recent years has been attributable to sales of wholesale electricity and natural gas into a robust market.  The prices of electricity in the wholesale power markets have stabilized at lower levels after the price volatility experienced in the second half of 2000 and the first half of 2001.  Power prices are influenced by many factors outside our control, including:      fuel prices;       transmission constraints;       supply and demand;       weather;       economic conditions; and       the rules, regulations and actions of the system operators in those markets.   Moreover, unlike most other commodities, electricity cannot be stored and therefore must be produced concurrently with its use.  As a result, wholesale power markets are subject to significant price fluctuations over relatively short periods of time and can be unpredictable.  28   The success of our oil and gas operations will depend somewhat upon the prevailing market prices of oil and natural gas.  Historically, oil and natural gas prices and markets have also been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future.  A decrease in oil or natural gas prices will not only reduce revenues and profits, but will also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable and may result in charges to earnings for impairment of the value of these assets.  Oil and natural gas prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control.  A decline in fuel price volatility could also affect our revenues and returns from energy marketing, which historically tend to increase when markets are volatile. Construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource recovery facilities involve significant risks which could lead to lost revenues or increased expenses. The construction, expansion, refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource recovery facilities involve many risks, including:      the inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals;       the unavailability of equipment;       supply interruptions;       work stoppages;       labor disputes;       social unrest;       weather interferences;       unforeseen engineering, environmental and geological problems; and       unanticipated cost overruns.   The ongoing operation of our facilities involves all of the risks described above, in addition to risks relating to the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency.  New plants may employ recently developed and technologically complex equipment, especially in the case of newer environmental emission control technology.  Any of these risks could cause us to operate below expected capacity levels, which in turn could result in lost revenues, increased expenses, higher maintenance costs and penalties.  While we maintain insurance, obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance and our rights under warranties or performance guarantees may not be adequate to cover lost revenues, increased expenses or liquidated damage payments.  29   Our power project development, expansion and acquisition activities may not be successful, which would impair our ability to execute our growth strategy. The growth of our independent power business through development, expansion and acquisition activities is important to our future growth.  We may not be able to continue to develop attractive opportunities or to complete acquisitions or development projects we undertake.  Factors that could cause our activities to be unsuccessful include:      competition;       the trend of utilities building their own generation or looking for developers to develop and build projects for sale to utilities under turnkey arrangements;       lower than anticipated increases in the demand for power in our target markets;       fuel prices or fuel supply constraints;       transmission constraints;       changes in federal or state laws and regulations;       our inability to negotiate acceptable acquisition, construction, fuel supply, power sales or other material agreements;       our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all;       our inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals;       capital market conditions; and       our inability to successfully integrate any businesses we acquire.   Estimates of the quantity and value of our proved oil and gas reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves. There are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and their values.  The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors.  Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.  The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretations and judgment, and the assumptions used regarding quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves and prices for oil and natural gas.   Actual prices, production, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will vary from those assumed in our estimates, and these variances may be significant.Any significant variance from the assumptions used could result in the actual quantity of our reserves and future net cash flow being materially different from our estimates.  In addition, results of drilling, testing and production and changes in oil and natural gas prices after the date of the estimate may result in substantial upward or downward revisions. Estimates of the quality and quantity of our coal reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in three dimensional structural modeling. There are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of coal reserves.  The process of coal volume estimation requires interpretations of drill hole log data and subsequent computer modeling of the intersected deposit.  Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or modeling could materially affect the quantity and quality of our reserves.  The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of engineering and geological interpretations and judgment of known data, assumptions used regarding structural limits and mining extents, conditions encountered during actual reserve recovery, and undetected deposit anomalies.  Variance from the assumptions used and drill hole modeling density could result in additions or deletions from our volume estimates.  In addition, future environmental, economic or geologic changes may occur or become known that can result in reserve revisions either upward ordownward from prior reserve estimates.  30   Our business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and permitting requirements as well as on-site environmental liabilities we assumed when we acquired some of our facilities.  We may be adversely affected by any future inability to comply with existing or future regulations or requirements or the potentially high cost of complying with such requirements. Our business is subject to extensive energy, environmental and other laws and regulations of federal, state and local authorities.  We generally are required to obtain and comply with a wide variety of licenses, permits and other approvals in order to operate our facilities.  In the course of complying with these requirements, we may incur significant additional costs.  If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to civil or criminal liability and the imposition of liens or fines.  In addition, existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted, new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities, and future changes in laws and regulation may have a detrimental effect on our business. In acquiring some of our facilities, we assumed on-site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of those facilities, regardless of when such liabilities arose and whether known or unknown, and in some cases agreed to indemnify the former owners of those facilities for on-site environmental liabilities.  We strive at all times to be in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.  However, steps to bring our facilities into compliance, if necessary, could be expensive, and thus could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.  Furthermore, with the continuing trends toward stricter standards, greater regulation, more extensive permitting requirements and an increase in the assets we operate, we expect our environmental expenditures to be substantial in the future. Ongoing changes in the United States utility industry, such as state and federal regulatory changes, a potential increase in the number of our competitors or the imposition of price limitations to address market volatility, could adversely affect our profitability. The United States electric utility industry is currently experiencing increasing competitive pressures as a result of:      the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935;       consumer demands;       technological advances; and       greater availability of natural gas-fired power generation, and other factors.   FERC has implemented and continues to propose regulatory changes to increase access to the nationwide transmission grid by utility and non-utility purchasers and sellers of electricity.  In addition, a number of states have implemented or are considering or currently implementing methods to introduce and promote retail competition.  Industry deregulation in some states has led to the disaggregation of some vertically integrated utilities into separate generation, transmission and distribution businesses, and deregulation initiatives in a number of states may encourage further disaggregation.  As a result, significant additional competitors could become active in the generation, transmission and distribution segments of our industry, which could negatively affect our ability to expand our asset base. In addition, the independent system operators who oversee many of the wholesale power markets have in the past imposed, and may in the future continue to impose, price limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets.  These types of price limitations and other mechanisms may adversely affect the profitability of those generating facilities that sell energy into the wholesale power markets.  Given the extreme volatility and lack of meaningful long-term price history in some of these markets and the imposition of price limitations by independent system operators, we may not be able to operate profitably in all wholesale power markets. 31   "
