4,EML,EASTERN CO,2024-03-12,"ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS The Company’s business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, the risks and uncertainties described below. In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, these risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company’s business. If any of these risks, or any risks not presently known to the Company or currently deemed immaterial by the Company, materialize, the Company’s business, reputation, stock price, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected, and the Company may not be able to achieve its goals or expectations. This section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. Risks Related to Competition and Global Operations The Company’s business is subject to risks associated with conducting business overseas. International operations have been and could in the future be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection measures, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, differing intellectual property rights and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs. Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies could result in increases or decreases in earnings and may adversely affect the value of the Company’s assets outside the United States. Increased pricing in response to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on demand for the Company’s products, which would affect sales and profits. Some of the Company’s competitors import products from Asia and Latin America that benefit from favorable currency exchange rates and lower cost labor, which has created downward pricing pressure with respect to the Company’s products that is likely to continue. Exchange rate fluctuations have at times and could in the future exacerbate this pricing pressure and impair the ability of the Company’s products to compete with products imported from regions with favorable exchange rates. The Company’s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations. These trade agreements could impose requirements that adversely affect the Company’s business, such as, but not limited to, setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into the Company’s key markets in North America. The Company’s ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the United States or other countries. These issues could delay importation of products or require the Company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial conditions, or results of operations.  6Table of Contents In addition, the Company’s growth strategy involves expanding sales of its products into foreign markets. There is no guarantee that the Company’s products will be accepted by foreign customers or how long it may take to develop sales of the Company’s products in these foreign markets. Supply chain disruptions, delays in production, and forecast inaccuracies have affected and could continue to affect our ability to meet customer demand, lead to higher costs, result in excess inventory, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Raw materials needed to manufacture the Company’s products are obtained from numerous suppliers. Under normal market conditions, these raw materials are readily available on the open market from a variety of producers. However, from time to time, the prices and availability of these raw materials fluctuate due to changes in existing and expected rates of inflation, which could impair the Company’s ability to procure the required raw materials for its operations or increase the cost of manufacturing its products. For example, supply shortages and supply chain disruptions originally triggered by shutdowns and other restrictions imposed to slow the spread and resurgence of COVID-19 impacted the prices and availability of certain raw materials and components used in the production of the Company’s products. The Company may be unable to pass all of these price increases on to its customers and could experience reductions in its profit margins. Any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair the Company’s ability to meet production requirements in a timely manner or at all. Similarly, any prolonged interruption in service by one of our key component suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for such components within a reasonable period of time, or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, which could result in delays or interruptions in our operations, which in turn would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company faces active global competition and if it does not compete effectively, its business may suffer. The Company encounters competition in all its business operations, and imports from Asia and Latin America with favorable currency exchange rates and low-cost labor have resulted in pricing pressure. The Company competes with other companies that offer comparable products or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses. To remain profitable and defend market share, the Company must continue to offer high quality custom engineered products on a timely basis, develop new products or update existing products to compete with new or updated products introduced by competitors, deploy internal engineering resources, maintain cost-effective manufacturing capabilities through its wholly owned Asian subsidiaries, expand its product lines through product development and acquisitions, and maintain sufficient inventory for fast turnaround of customer orders. Additionally, technological developments and enhancements of products and services offerings in our industry may require an expanded use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning; if we are unable to keep pace with the rate of these and other developments, our ability to effectively compete could be adversely affected. We expect the level of competition to remain high in the future, which, if not effectively matched or exceeded, could limit our ability to maintain or increase our profitability. The Company may not be able to compete effectively on all these fronts and with all its competitors, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profit margins. Furthermore, the Company may have to reduce prices on its products and services, or make other concessions, to stay competitive and retain market share. Price reductions taken by the Company in response to customer and competitive pressures, as well as price reductions and promotional actions taken to drive demand that may not result in anticipated sales levels, could also negatively impact the Company’s business. Tariffs, trade sanctions and political instability may impact the availability or cost of raw materials, which could adversely affect our margins, ability to meet customer demand, business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company obtains raw materials used in the production of its products from domestic sources, as well as from Company-affiliated and unaffiliated sources in Asia. Changes in international trade duties and other aspects of international trade policy, both in the United States and abroad, could materially impact the cost of these raw materials. For example, from March 2018 until March 2021, the United States imposed an additional 25% tariff under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, on steel products imported into the United States. While these tariffs have mostly been lifted on imports from countries other than China, imports from many jurisdictions are subject to limitations on volume, after which substantial tariffs will be reimposed. The United States also imposed a 10% tariff on all aluminum imports into the United States, with initial exemptions for aluminum imported from certain U.S. trading partners. Such actions could increase steel and aluminum costs and decrease supply availability. In response to the invasion of Ukraine by the military forces of the Russian Federation, the United States, the European Union, and other jurisdictions have imposed sanctions that, among other things, prohibit the importation of a wide array of commodities and products from Russia, which is a major global supplier of nickel. Any increase in nickel, steel and/or aluminum prices that is not offset by an increase in the Company’s prices could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, if the Company is unable to acquire timely nickel, steel or aluminum supplies, the Company may need to decline customer orders, which could also have an adverse effect on the business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.  7Table of Contents Changes in competition in the markets that the Company services could impact revenues and earnings. Any change in competition may result in lost market share or reduced prices, which could result in reduced profits and margins. This may impair the ability to grow or even maintain current levels of revenues and earnings. The loss of certain customers could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, or results of operations until such business is replaced, and no assurances can be made that the Company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers. Risks Related to Acquisitions and Organic Growth The inability to develop new or updated products could limit growth. Demand for new products, or the need to update existing products to compete with new or updated products offered by competitors, could adversely affect the Company’s performance, ability to maintain current levels of revenues and earnings, and prospects for future growth if the Company were unable to develop and introduce new competitive products or updates to existing products at favorable profit margins. The uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products or updates to existing products, such as the market demands and the costs of development and production, may impede the successful development and introduction of new products or updates to existing products. Acceptance of the new or updated products may not meet sales expectations due to several factors, such as the Company’s potential inability to accurately predict market demand or to resolve technical issues in a timely and cost-effective manner. Additionally, the inability to develop new or updated products on a timely basis could result in the loss of business to competitors.  The inability to identify or complete acquisitions could limit growth. The Company’s future growth may partly depend on its ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses. The Company intends to seek additional acquisition opportunities, both to expand into new markets and to enhance the Company’s position in existing markets. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate terms, obtain financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets. Once acquired, operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability.  Acquisitions involve risk, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services, and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns. Although the Company’s management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there can be no assurances that the Company’s management will properly ascertain all such risks. In addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial debt and other expenses. Future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. Difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate businesses we may acquire in the future. We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, and the success of any such acquisitions depends on our ability to combine the acquired business with our existing business in a manner that does not disrupt our and the acquired business’s ongoing relationships with customers, suppliers, and employees. Our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, including risk of impairment; (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into the Company simultaneously and on schedule or to achieve expected synergies and (iii) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, cybersecurity and compliance issues, labor relations difficulties or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, or insurance or indemnities.  8Table of Contents Risks Related to Technology and Information Security Our technology is important to the Company’s success and the failure to protect this technology could put the Company at a competitive disadvantage. Some of the Company’s products rely on proprietary technology; therefore, the Company believes that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of its business. Despite the Company’s efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use the Company’s products or technology. Actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and the Company makes no assurances that any such actions will be successful. In addition to the United States, we have applied for intellectual property protection in other jurisdictions with respect to certain innovations and new products, product features, and processes. The laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business, or may contemplate doing business in the future, do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as U.S. law. As a result, these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products, services, and brands in foreign jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our financial performance. We may also encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our licensed and owned intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions. For example, China currently affords less protection to a company’s intellectual property than some other jurisdictions. As such, the lack of strong patent and other intellectual property protection in China may significantly increase our vulnerability regarding unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property and undermine our competitive position. Proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. The Company relies on information and technology for many of its business operations, which could fail and cause disruption to the Company’s business operations. The Company’s business operations are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to securely transmit, process and store electronic information and to communicate among its locations around the world and with clients and vendors. A shut-down of, or inability to access, one or more of the Company’s facilities, a power outage, a ransomware incident, or a failure of one or more of the Company’s information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair the Company’s ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. Computer viruses, cyberattacks, other external hazards and human error could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information, corruption of data or operational disruption. If sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, system failure, service denial or data loss and damage could result in a deterioration of the Company’s ability to write and process orders, provide customer service, or perform other necessary business functions. A breach in the security of the Company’s software or information technology systems could harm its reputation, result in a loss of current and potential customers, and subject the Company to material claims, which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition. If the Company’s security measures are breached, an unauthorized party may obtain access to the Company’s data or users’ or customers’ data. In addition, cyberattacks and similar acts could lead to interruptions and delays in operations or customer processing or a loss or breach of the Company’s or a customer’s data. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable, or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm the Company’s business is likely to increase as the Company expands its reliance on technology for its operations and order processing.  9Table of Contents Data breaches and other serious cybersecurity incidents have increased globally, along with the methods, techniques, and complexity of attacks, including use of viruses, ransomware and other malicious software, phishing, and other efforts to discover and exploit any design flaws, bugs, or other security vulnerabilities. Continued geopolitical turmoil, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, has heightened the risk of cyberattacks. We have been, and likely will continue to be, subject to such cyberattacks, although none has had a material impact on our operations. Also, the same cybersecurity threats exist for the third parties with whom we interact and share information and cyberattacks on third parties that possess or use our customer, personnel and other information could adversely impact us in the same way as would a direct cyberattack on us. The Company is subject to federal, state, and international laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information and individual payment data. The information, security and privacy requirements imposed by such laws and regulations are constantly evolving and are becoming increasingly demanding in the United States and other jurisdictions in which the Company operates. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with the Company’s data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines or other penalties, this could result in an order requiring that the Company change its data practices, which could be costly, divert management attention, and have an adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The Company has incurred and may continue to incur significant costs relating to compliance with these laws and regulations, including costs related to updating certain business practices and systems and ensuring continued compliance. Further, any changes to laws or regulations, including new restrictions or requirements applicable to our business, or an increase in enforcement of existing laws and regulations, could expose the Company to additional costs and liability. Any security breaches for which the Company is, or is perceived to be, responsible, in whole or in part, or any actual or perceived violations of data privacy laws and regulations, could subject the Company to legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations, which could harm the Company’s reputation and result in significant litigation costs and damage awards or settlement amounts. Any imposition of liability, particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage, could materially harm our operating results and financial condition. Security breaches also could cause the Company to lose current and potential customers, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. Moreover, the Company may be required to expend significant financial and other resources to further protect against security breaches or to rectify problems caused by any security breach. Litigation, Compliance and Regulatory Risks Delays in, or disagreements with the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm regarding, the Company’s evaluation of its internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Company’s stock or its borrowing ability. In addition, future changes in operating conditions could result in inadequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company is an “accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act and is thus required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 requires the Company to include in its Annual Report on Form 10-K management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal period for which the Company is filing the report. This report must also include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that the Company has identified. Additionally, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm is required to issue a report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and their evaluation of the operating effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s assessment requires it to make subjective judgments, and the independent registered public accounting firm may not agree with the Company’s assessment. If the Company or its independent registered public accounting firm were unable to complete the assessments within the period prescribed by Section 404 and thus be unable to conclude that the internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in the Company’s reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Company’s common stock or impact the Company’s borrowing ability. In addition, changes in operating conditions and changes in compliance with policies and procedures currently in place may result in inadequate internal control over financial reporting in the future. Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase the Company’s expenses and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition. The Company’s operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. These laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. The Company must conform its operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which the Company’s businesses operate as these requirements change.  10Table of Contents The Company uses and generates hazardous substances and wastes in its operations and, as a result, could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury. The Company has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations. In connection with the Company’s acquisitions, the Company may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which it may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require the Company to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Natural disasters, changes in climate, geo-political events and public health crises, including pandemics (such as COVID-19) and epidemics, and any related Company or government policies or actions may negatively impact our business. Natural disasters, changes in climate, geo-political events, and public health crises, including pandemics (such as COVID-19) and epidemics, as well as Company or government policies adopted or actions taken as a result of such events, could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons, weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate, geo-political events, such as war, civil unrest or terrorist attacks, or public health crises in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could result in loss of human life, significant property and equipment damage, environmental pollution, or reputational harm and could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Our business and operations may be disrupted if we do not respond, or are perceived not to respond, in an appropriate manner to any of these hazards and risks or any other major crisis or if we are unable to efficiently restore or replace affected operational components and capacity. Countermeasures to address global health crises, epidemics or pandemics, such as those that were taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19, may result in reduced demand for our products; disruptions to our supply chain, the global economy or financial or commodity markets; disruptions in our contractual arrangements with our service providers, suppliers and other counterparties; failures by our suppliers, contract manufacturers, contractors, joint venture partners and external business partners, to meet their obligations to us; or reduced workforce productivity. Any such occurrence could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity position. Further, our insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all resulting losses described above, and the cost to obtain adequate coverage may increase for us in the future or may not be available. The Company could be subject to litigation, which could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, or results of operations.          From time to time, the Company’s operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, patent, and intellectual property, commercial, contract, and environmental and employment matters, which are defended and settled in the ordinary course of business. Any litigation to which the Company may be subject could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, or results of operations. See Item 3 – Legal Proceedings of this Form 10-K for a discussion of current litigation. The Company could be subject to additional tax liabilities. The Company is subject to income tax laws of the United States, its states, and municipalities and those of other foreign jurisdictions in which the Company has business operations. These laws are complex, evolving, and subject to interpretation by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities.  The Company’s future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the (1) applicable tax laws; (2) composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates; or (3) recoverability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Beginning in 2022, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the existing option to deduct research and development expenditures and requires taxpayers to amortize them over five years pursuant to IRC Section 174. This requirement is expected to reduce our cash flow. In August 2022, the United States enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) which includes a new 15% corporate minimum tax as well as a 1% excise tax on fair value of corporate stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. The IRA could have a negative impact on our tax position. Many countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are also actively considering changes to existing tax laws or have proposed or enacted new laws that could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate our business. Any of these developments or changes in federal, state, or international tax laws or tax rulings could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our results of operations.  11Table of Contents Significant judgment and interpretation are required in determining the Company’s worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of business, transactions arise where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although the Company believes that our tax estimates are reasonable, the outcome of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Based on the status of a given tax audit or related litigation, a material effect on the Company’s income tax provision or net income may result during the period or periods from the initial recognition of a particular matter in the Company’s reported financial results to the final closure of that tax audit or settlement of related litigation when the ultimate tax and related cash flow is known with certainty. New or existing U.S. or foreign laws and regulations could subject the Company to claims or otherwise impact the Company’s business, financial condition, or results of operations. The Company is subject to a variety of laws, regulations, rules, and policies in both the U.S. and foreign countries that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort, and can subject the Company to claims or other remedies. These laws, regulations, rules, and policies could relate to any of an array of issues including, but not limited to, data privacy and security, environmental, tax, intellectual property, trade secrets, product liability, contracts, antitrust, employment, securities, import/export, and unfair competition. These laws and regulations may differ in different jurisdictions and are subject to change. The cost of maintaining compliance under multiple and changing regulatory regimes, and expenditures that may be required to comply with new laws and regulations, may adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. In the event that the Company fails to comply with or violates applicable U.S. or foreign laws or regulations or customer policies, the Company could be subject to civil or criminal claims or proceedings that may result in monetary fines, penalties or other costs against the Company or its employees, which may adversely affect the Company’s operating results, financial condition, customer relations and ability to conduct its business. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness Indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility. As of December 30, 2023, the Company had $43.9 million in total consolidated indebtedness. Subject to restrictions contained in the Credit Agreement, the Company may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions. The level of indebtedness and servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operation and business strategy. For example, the indebtedness could:   ·Place the Company at a competitive disadvantage relative to the Company’s competitors, some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources; ·Limit the Company’s ability to borrow additional funds; ·Limit the Company’s ability to complete future acquisitions; ·Limit the Company’s ability to pay dividends; ·Limit the Company’s ability to make capital expenditures; and ·Increase the Company’s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.   12Table of Contents The Company’s ability to make scheduled principal payments, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy other debt obligations will depend upon future operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond the Company’s control. In addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or the issuance of equity would be available to the Company on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of the Company’s debt. If the Company were unable to service its indebtedness, the business, financial condition, and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.  The Credit Agreement contains covenants requiring the Company to achieve certain financial and operational results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. The Company’s ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in the Credit Agreement may be affected by events beyond our control, and the Company may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements.  The Credit Agreement also contains several restrictive covenants that could adversely affect the Company’s ability to operate its business. These covenants restrict, among other things, the Company’s ability to:  ·Merge with or into another company or sell assets; ·Grant liens; ·Incur additional indebtedness; ·Make investments or guarantee indebtedness of another person or entity; ·Pay dividends, make distributions, or repurchase equity; ·Engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and ·Make certain changes to the Company’s business.  A breach of these covenants or the Company’s inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in our Credit Agreement could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Agreement and/or the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our credit facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, the Company’s assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under our credit facility or the Company’s other indebtedness. Risks Related to Global Economic Conditions Global economic conditions have in the past and may in the future have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Global economic conditions have in the past and may in the future impact the Company’s results.  For example, volatile economic conditions that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic led to economic slowdowns that caused contractions in some or all the markets we serve, and these impacts have continued and may continue for the foreseeable future. This has led to and may continue to lead to decreased demand for the Company’s products, which in turn has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Other macroeconomic factors also remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, and overall economic slowdowns could reduce the Company’s sales or erode operating margin, in either case reducing earnings.  Economic conditions or changes in asset returns interest rates could increase our pension plan funding obligations and reduce our profitability In addition, pension plan funded status, the ratio of plan assets over plan liabilities, is largely influenced by current market conditions. To the extent asset returns and interest rates, which are used to discount future plan benefits, change from prior measurement periods, the plan’s funded ratio has the potential to change significantly. Declines in interest rates and projected rates of return could require us to make significant additional contributions to our pension plans in the future.  13Table of Contents General Risk Factors
 The Company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets may become impaired, which could require a significant charge to earnings be recognized. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually. Future operating results used in the assumptions, such as sales or profit forecasts, may not materialize, and the Company has been and could in the future be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment is determined, resulting in an unfavorable impact on our results of operations.  The Company may need additional capital in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. From time to time, the Company has historically relied on outside financing to fund expanded operations, capital expenditure programs and acquisitions. The Company may require additional capital in the future to fund operations or strategic opportunities. The Company cannot be assured that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, the terms of available financing may place limits on the Company’s financial and operating flexibility. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient capital in the future, the Company may not be able to expand or acquire complementary businesses and may not be able to continue to develop new products or otherwise respond to changing business conditions or competitive pressures. The Company’s stock price may become highly volatile, and investors may not be able to sell their shares at their desired prices, or at all. The Company’s stock price may change dramatically when buyers seeking to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock exceed the shares available on the market, or when there are no buyers to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock when shareholders are trying to sell their shares. The Company’s common stock has historically been “thinly” traded, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing shares of Company common stock at prevailing prices at any given time may be relatively small. This may contribute to price volatility, as the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our shareholders may disproportionately influence share price and may prevent investors from selling their shares at or above their purchase price if there is not sufficient demand for the shares at the time of sale. The Company depends on key management, sales and marketing and technical personnel, the loss of whom could harm its business. The Company depends on key management and technical personnel. The loss of one or more key employees could materially and adversely affect the Company. The Company’s success also depends on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales and marketing and management personnel necessary for the maintenance and expansion of its activities. The Company faces strong competition for such personnel and may not be able to attract or retain such personnel. In addition, when the Company experiences periods with little or no profits, a decrease in compensation based on profits may make it difficult to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. To attract and retain executives and other key employees, the Company must provide a competitive compensation package. If the Company’s profits decrease, or if the Company’s total compensation package is not viewed as competitive, the Company’s ability to attract, retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened. The failure to successfully hire and retain executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations.  14Table of Contents The Company may not be able to reach acceptable terms for contracts negotiated with its labor unions and be subject to work stoppages or disruption of production. The Company has been successful in negotiating new contracts over the years but cannot guarantee that will continue and the Company has, in the past experienced, and could in the future experience, temporary work stoppages during negotiation of such contracts. Failure to negotiate new union contracts, or any work stoppage that is prolonged, could result in the disruption of production, inability to deliver product, or several unforeseen circumstances, any of which could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition. During 2024, no union contracts are scheduled to expire. Deterioration in the creditworthiness of several major customers could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, or results of operations.  Included as a significant asset on the Company’s balance sheet are accounts receivable from our customers. If several large customers become insolvent or are otherwise unable to pay for products or become unwilling or unable to make payments in a timely manner, it could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.  Although the Company is not dependent on any one customer, deterioration in several large customers at the same time could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition. One customer represented 12% of total accounts receivable for fiscal 2023 and one customer represented 14% of total accounts receivable for fiscal 2022.  The Company’s operating results may fluctuate, which makes the results of operations difficult to predict and could cause the results to fall short of expectations. The Company’s operating results may fluctuate because of several factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing the Company’s operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and past results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Quarterly, year to date, and annual costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues may differ significantly from historical or projected levels. Future operating results may fall below expectations. These types of events could cause the price of the Company’s stock to fall.  15Table of Contents "
17,EML,EASTERN CO,2023-03-14,"ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS The Company’s business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, the risks and uncertainties described below. In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, these risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company’s business. If any of these risks, or any risks not presently known to the Company or currently deemed immaterial by the Company, materialize, the Company’s business, reputation, stock price, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected, and the Company may not be able to achieve its goals or expectations. This section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. Risks Related to Our Business Our financial and operating performance has been and may continue to be adversely affected by COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates, and potential recessionary pressures, and may be adversely affected by future developments with respect to this or another epidemic.  As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on economic conditions, the Company has experienced and could continue to experience disruptions to its business, its operations, the delivery of its products and customer demand for its products, including the following: ·The broader economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including resurgences, may continue to result in unfavorable operating earnings and cash flow generation in the months to follow. Current global economic conditions are highly volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in economic slowdowns that have caused and are likely to continue to cause contractions in some or all the markets we serve. This has led to and may continue to lead to decreased demand for the Company’s products, which in turn has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Other macroeconomic factors also remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, and overall economic slowdowns could reduce the Company’s sales or erode operating margin, in either case reducing earnings. In addition, volatile global economic conditions may cause foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which could result in increases or decreases in earnings and may adversely affect the value of the Company’s assets outside the United States. Increased pricing in response to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on demand for the Company’s products, which would affect sales and profits. Exchange rate fluctuations could also increase pricing pressure and impair the ability of the Company’s products to compete with products imported from regions with favorable exchange rates.·Supply shortages and supply chain disruptions originally triggered by shutdowns and other restrictions imposed to slow the spread and resurgence of COVID-19 have impacted and may continue to impact the prices and availability of certain of the raw materials and components used in the production of the Company’s products, which could impair the Company’s ability to procure the required raw materials and components for its operations or increase the cost of manufacturing its products. The Company may be unable to pass increases in the cost of raw materials and components on to its customers and could experience reductions to its profit margins. Also, any decrease in the availability of raw materials and components could impair the Company’s ability to meet production requirements in a timely manner or at all.·The economic downturn has resulted and could continue to result in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets exceeding their fair value, which has required and could continue to require the Company to recognize asset impairment.       7Table of Contents       ·To the extent the Company draws under the revolving portion of the Credit Agreement, debt of the Company would increase. Such an increase in indebtedness could adversely affect the Company’s financial results or ability to incur additional debt and could negatively impact credit ratings. The continuing economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including any resurgences, could also negatively impact the Company’s compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement or the interest rate of borrowings under the Credit Agreement. In addition, as a result of the risks described above, the Company may in the future be required to raise additional debt or equity financing, and the availability, terms and cost of such financing would depend on, among other things, global economic conditions, conditions in the global financing markets, trading prices of the Company’s common stock, the credit ratings of the Company, and the outlook for the industries in which the Company operates, all of which could be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the extent of any resurgences, and related economic effects, including inflation, rising interest rates, and potential recessionary pressures. There can be no assurance that such financing would be available on acceptable terms, in sufficient quantities, or at all.·Pension plan funded status, the ratio of plan assets over plan liabilities, is largely influenced by current market conditions. To the extent asset returns and interest rates, which are used to discount future plan benefits, change from prior measurement periods, the plan’s funded ratio has the potential to change significantly.  Any of the foregoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic conditions, if it persists, worsens or recurs, or the future occurrence of any other epidemic, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $64,147,000 in total consolidated indebtedness. Subject to restrictions contained in the Credit Agreement, the Company may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions. The level of indebtedness and servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operation and business strategy. For example, the indebtedness could:  ·Place the Company at a competitive disadvantage relative to the Company’s competitors, some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources;·Limit the Company’s ability to borrow additional funds;·Limit the Company’s ability to complete future acquisitions;·Limit the Company’s ability to pay dividends;·Limit the Company’s ability to make capital expenditures; and·Increase the Company’s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. The Company’s ability to make scheduled principal payments, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy other debt obligations will depend upon future operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond the Company’s control. In addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or the issuance of equity would be available to the Company on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of the Company’s debt. If the Company were unable to service its indebtedness, the business, financial condition, and results of operation would be materially adversely affected.  The Credit Agreement contains covenants requiring the Company to achieve certain financial and operations results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. The Company’s ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in the Credit Agreement may be affected by events beyond our control, and the Company may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements.  The Credit Agreement also contains a number of restrictive covenants that could adversely affect the Company’s ability to operate its business. These covenants restrict, among other things, the Company’s ability to: ·Merge with or into another company or sell assets;·Grant liens;·Incur additional indebtedness;·Make investments or guarantee indebtedness of another person or entity;·Pay dividends, make distributions or repurchase equity;·Engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and·Make certain changes to the Company’s business.  8Table of Contents A breach of these covenants or the Company’s inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in our Credit Agreement could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Agreement and/or the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our credit facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, the Company’s assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under our credit facility or the Company’s other indebtedness. The phaseout of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of LIBOR with a different reference rate such as SOFR, may adversely affect interest rates. Central banks around the world, including the FRB, are working to implement the transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) to replacement benchmarks including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) in the United States. The ICE Benchmark Administration (the “IBA”) ceased publication of all settings of non-US dollar LIBOR and the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings on December 31, 2021, with the publication of the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings scheduled to be discontinued after June 30, 2023. The Adjustable Interest Rate Act (the “LIBOR Act”), which was signed into law on March 15, 2022, provided a replacement framework for outstanding financial contracts tied to LIBOR once LIBOR ceases to be published. The LIBOR Act provides a statutory mechanism and safe harbor that applies on a nationwide basis to replace LIBOR with a benchmark rate, selected by the Federal Reserve Board based on SOFR, for certain contracts that reference LIBOR and contain no or insufficient fallback provisions. The LIBOR Act preempts and supersedes any state or local law, statute, rule, regulation, or standard relating to the selection or use of a benchmark replacement or related changes and allows parties that already have effective fallback provisions to opt out of the legislation. On December 16, 2022, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule implementing the LIBOR Act that, among other things, identifies the applicable SOFR-based benchmark replacements under the LIBOR Act for various contact types. The difference between LIBOR and SOFR is that LIBOR is a forward-looking rate which means the interest rate is set at the beginning of the period with payment due at the end. SOFR is a backward-looking overnight rate which has implications for how interest and other payments are based. The change from LIBOR to SOFR may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs. The effect of this change is still unknown and could materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.  Risks Related to Competition and Global Operations The Company’s business is subject to risks associated with conducting business overseas. International operations could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection measures, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, differing intellectual property rights and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs. Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies could result in increases or decreases in earnings and may adversely affect the value of the Company’s assets outside the United States. The Company’s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations. These trade agreements could impose requirements that adversely affect the Company’s business, such as, but not limited to, setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into the Company’s key markets in North America.  The Company’s ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the United States or other countries. These issues could delay importation of products or require the Company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial conditions, or results of operations.  In addition, the Company’s growth strategy involves expanding sales of its products into foreign markets. There is no guarantee that the Company’s products will be accepted by foreign customers or how long it may take to develop sales of the Company’s products in these foreign markets. 9Table of Contents Supply chain disruptions, delays in production, and forecast inaccuracies have affected and could continue to affect our ability to meet customer demand, lead to higher costs, result in excess inventory, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Raw materials needed to manufacture products are obtained from numerous suppliers. Under normal market conditions, these raw materials are readily available on the open market from a variety of producers. However, from time to time, the prices and availability of these raw materials fluctuate due to the impact of inflation, as well as changes in existing and expected rates of inflation, which could impair the Company’s ability to procure the required raw materials for its operations or increase the cost of manufacturing its products. If the price of raw materials increases, the Company may be unable to pass these increases on to its customers and could experience reductions to its profit margins. Additionally, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair the Company’s ability to meet production requirements in a timely manner or at all. The Company faces active global competition and if it does not compete effectively, its business may suffer. The Company encounters competition in all its business operations, and imports from Asia and Latin America with favorable currency exchange rates and low-cost labor have resulted in pricing pressure. The Company competes with other companies that offer comparable products or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses. To remain profitable and defend market share, the Company must continue to offer high quality custom engineered products on a timely basis, develop new products or update existing products to compete with new or updated products introduced by competitors, deploy internal engineering resources, maintain cost-effective manufacturing capabilities through its wholly owned Asian subsidiaries, expand its product lines through product development and acquisitions, and maintain sufficient inventory for fast turnaround of customer orders. The Company may not be able to compete effectively on all these fronts and with all its competitors, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profit margins. In addition, the Company may have to reduce prices on its products and services, or make other concessions, to stay competitive and retain market share. Price reductions taken by the Company in response to customer and competitive pressures, as well as price reductions and promotional actions taken to drive demand that may not result in anticipated sales levels, could also negatively impact the Company’s business. Tariffs, trade sanctions and political instability may impact the availability or cost of raw materials, which could adversely affect our margins, ability to meet customer demand, business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company obtains raw materials used in the production of its products from domestic sources, as well as from Company-affiliated and unaffiliated sources in Asia. Changes in international trade duties and other aspects of international trade policy, both in the United States and abroad, could materially impact the cost of these raw materials. For example, from March 2018 until March 2021, the United States imposed an additional 25% tariff under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, on steel products imported into the United States. While these tariffs have mostly been lifted on imports from countries other than China, imports from many jurisdictions are subject to limitations on volume, after which substantial tariffs will be reimposed. The United States also imposed a 10% tariff on all aluminum imports into the United States, with initial exemptions for aluminum imported from certain U.S. trading partners. Such actions could increase steel and aluminum costs and decrease supply availability. In response to the invasion of Ukraine by the military forces of the Russian Federation, the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions have imposed sanctions that, among other things, prohibit the importation of a wide array of commodities and products from Russia, which is a major global supplier of nickel. Any increase in nickel, steel and/or aluminum prices that is not offset by an increase in the Company’s prices could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, if the Company is unable to acquire timely nickel, steel or aluminum supplies, the Company may need to decline customer orders, which could also have an adverse effect on the business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.  In addition to sustained increases in the cost of raw materials, the military conflict between Ukraine and Russia and the related sanctions and trade restrictions have continued to cause supply disruptions with respect to component parts for our products and resulted in higher oil and other commodity prices that have increased shipping and transportation costs. If the conflict persists or escalates, this may further disrupt global supply chains and could result in shortages of key raw materials or component parts that the Company’s suppliers require to satisfy our needs. Any increases in the cost, or shortages, of raw materials or energy may continue to create supply issues for critical materials that could constrain the Company’s manufacturing levels, which may lead to inability to meet demand for our products and could result in a loss of business and possible reduced margins for the Company if the cost increases cannot be fully offset by higher selling prices. 10Table of Contents Changes in competition in the markets that the Company services could impact revenues and earnings. Any change in competition may result in lost market share or reduced prices, which could result in reduced profits and margins. This may impair the ability to grow or even maintain current levels of revenues and earnings. The loss of certain customers could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, or results of operations until such business is replaced, and no assurances can be made that the Company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers. Risks Related to Acquisitions and Organic Growth The inability to develop new or updated products could limit growth. Demand for new products, or the need to update existing products to compete with new or updated products offered by competitors, could adversely affect the Company’s performance, ability to maintain current levels of revenues and earnings, and prospects for future growth if the Company were unable to develop and introduce new competitive products or updates to existing products at favorable profit margins. The uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products or updates to existing products, such as the market demands and the costs of development and production, may impede the successful development and introduction of new products or updates to existing products. Acceptance of the new or updated products may not meet sales expectations due to several factors, such as the Company’s potential inability to accurately predict market demand or to resolve technical issues in a timely and cost-effective manner. Additionally, the inability to develop new or updated products on a timely basis could result in the loss of business to competitors.  The inability to identify or complete acquisitions could limit growth. The Company’s future growth may partly depend on its ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses. The Company intends to seek additional acquisition opportunities, both to expand into new markets and to enhance the Company’s position in existing markets. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate terms, obtain financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets. Once acquired, operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability.  Acquisitions involve risk, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns. Although the Company’s management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there can be no assurances that the Company’s management will properly ascertain all such risks. In addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial debt and other expenses. Future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. Difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions of any businesses we may acquire in the future. We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, and the success of any such acquisitions depends on our ability to combine the acquired business with our existing business in a manner that does not disrupt our and the acquired business’s ongoing relationships with customers, suppliers, and employees. Our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, including risk of impairment; (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into the Company simultaneously and on schedule or to achieve expected synergies and (iii) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, cybersecurity and compliance issues, labor relations difficulties or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, or insurance or indemnities. 11Table of Contents Risks Related to Technology and Information Security Our technology is important to the Company’s success and the failure to protect this technology could put the Company at a competitive disadvantage. Some of the Company’s products rely on proprietary technology; therefore, the Company believes that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of its business. Despite the Company’s efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use the Company’s products or technology. Actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and the Company makes no assurances that any such actions will be successful. In addition to the United States, we have applied for intellectual property protection in other jurisdictions with respect to certain innovations and new products, product features, and processes. The laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business, or may contemplate doing business in the future, do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as U.S. law. As a result, these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products, services, and brands in foreign jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our financial performance. We may also encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our licensed and owned intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions. For example, China currently affords less protection to a company’s intellectual property than some other jurisdictions. As such, the lack of strong patent and other intellectual property protection in China may significantly increase our vulnerability regarding unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property and undermine our competitive position. Proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. The Company relies on information and technology for many of its business operations, which could fail and cause disruption to the Company’s business operations.  The Company’s business operations are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to securely transmit, process and store electronic information and to communicate among its locations around the world and with clients and vendors. A shut-down of, or inability to access, one or more of the Company’s facilities, a power outage, a ransomware incident, or a failure of one or more of the Company’s information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair the Company’s ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. Computer viruses, cyberattacks, other external hazards and human error could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information, corruption of data or operational disruption. If sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, system failure, service denial or data loss and damage could result in a deterioration of the Company’s ability to write and process orders, provide customer service, or perform other necessary business functions. A breach in the security of the Company’s software or information technology systems could harm its reputation, result in a loss of current and potential customers, and subject the Company to material claims, which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition. If the Company’s security measures are breached, an unauthorized party may obtain access to the Company’s data or users’ or customers’ data. In addition, cyberattacks and similar acts could lead to interruptions and delays in operations or customer processing or a loss or breach of the Company’s or a customer’s data. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable, or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm the Company’s business is likely to increase as the Company expands its reliance on technology for its operations and order processing and enhances the number of web-based products we offer, the services we provide, and our global operations. 12Table of Contents  Data breaches and other serious cybersecurity incidents have increased globally, along with the methods, techniques and complexity of attacks, including use of viruses, ransomware and other malicious software, phishing and other efforts to discover and exploit any design flaws, bugs or other security vulnerabilities. Continued geopolitical turmoil, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, has heightened the risk of cyberattacks. We have been, and likely will continue to be, subject to such cyberattacks, although none has had a material impact on our operations. Also, the same cybersecurity threats exist for the third parties with whom we interact and share information and cyberattacks on third parties that possess or use our customer, personnel and other information could adversely impact us in the same way as would a direct cyberattack on us. The Company is subject to federal, state, and international laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information and individual payment data. The information, security and privacy requirements imposed by such laws and regulations are constantly evolving and are becoming increasingly demanding in the United States and other jurisdictions in which the Company operates. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with the Company’s data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines or other penalties, this could result in an order requiring that the Company change its data practices, which could be costly, divert management attention, and have an adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The Company has incurred and may continue to incur significant costs relating to compliance with these laws and regulations, including costs related to updating certain business practices and systems and ensuring continued compliance. Further, any changes to laws or regulations, including new restrictions or requirements applicable to our business, or an increase in enforcement of existing laws and regulations, could expose the Company to additional costs and liability. Any security breaches for which the Company is, or is perceived to be, responsible, in whole or in part, or any actual or perceived violations of data privacy laws and regulations, could subject the Company to legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations, which could harm the Company’s reputation and result in significant litigation costs and damage awards or settlement amounts. Any imposition of liability, particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage, could materially harm our operating results and financial condition. Security breaches also could cause the Company to lose current and potential customers, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. Moreover, the Company may be required to expend significant financial and other resources to further protect against security breaches or to rectify problems caused by any security breach. Litigation, Compliance and Regulatory Risks Delays in, or disagreements with the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm regarding, the Company’s evaluation of its internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Company’s stock or its borrowing ability. In addition, future changes in operating conditions could result in inadequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company is an “accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act and is thus required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 requires the Company to include in its report management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal period for which the Company is filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K. This report must also include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that the Company has identified. Additionally, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm is required to issue a report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and their evaluation of the operating effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s assessment requires it to make subjective judgments, and the independent registered public accounting firm may not agree with the Company’s assessment. If the Company or its independent registered public accounting firm were unable to complete the assessments within the period prescribed by Section 404 and thus be unable to conclude that the internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in the Company’s reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Company’s common stock or impact the Company’s borrowing ability. In addition, changes in operating conditions and changes in compliance with policies and procedures currently in place may result in inadequate internal control over financial reporting in the future. Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase the Company’s expenses and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition. The Company’s operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. These laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. The Company must conform its operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which the Company’s businesses operate as these requirements change. 13Table of Contents The Company uses and generates hazardous substances and wastes in its operations and, as a result, could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury. The Company has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations. In connection with the Company’s acquisitions, the Company may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which it may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require the Company to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  Natural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-political events may negatively impact our business. Natural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-political events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons, weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events, such as war, civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. The Company could be subject to litigation, which could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, or results of operations. From time to time, the Company’s operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, and environmental and employment matters, which are defended and settled in the ordinary course of business. Any litigation to which the Company may be subject could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, or results of operations. See Item 3 – Legal Proceedings of this Form 10-K for a discussion of current litigation. The Company could be subject to additional tax liabilities. The Company is subject to income tax laws of the United States, its states, and municipalities and those of other foreign jurisdictions in which the Company has business operations. These laws are complex, evolving, and subject to interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. The Company’s future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the (1) applicable tax laws; (2) composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates; or (3) recoverability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Beginning in 2022, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the existing option to deduct research and development expenditures and requires taxpayers to amortize them over five years pursuant to IRC Section 174. This requirement is expected to reduce our cash flows. In August 2022, the United States enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) which includes a new 15% corporate minimum tax as well as a 1% excise tax on fair value of corporate stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. The IRA could have a negative impact on our tax position. Many countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are also actively considering changes to existing tax laws or have proposed or enacted new laws that could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate our business. Any of these developments or changes in federal, state, or international tax laws or tax rulings could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our results of operations. Significant judgment and interpretation are required in determining the Company’s worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of business, transactions arise where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although the Company believes that our tax estimates are reasonable, the outcome of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Based on the status of a given tax audit or related litigation, a material effect on the Company’s income tax provision or net income may result during the period or periods from the initial recognition of a particular matter in the Company’s reported financial results to the final closure of that tax audit or settlement of related litigation when the ultimate tax and related cash flow is known with certainty. 14Table of Contents General Risk Factors
 The Company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets may become impaired, which could require a significant charge to earnings be recognized. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually. Future operating results used in the assumptions, such as sales or profit forecasts, may not materialize, and the Company has been and could in the future be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment is determined, resulting in an unfavorable impact on our results of operations.  The Company may need additional capital in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. From time to time, the Company has historically relied on outside financing to fund expanded operations, capital expenditure programs and acquisitions. The Company may require additional capital in the future to fund operations or strategic opportunities. The Company cannot be assured that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, the terms of available financing may place limits on the Company’s financial and operating flexibility. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient capital in the future, the Company may not be able to expand or acquire complementary businesses and may not be able to continue to develop new products or otherwise respond to changing business conditions or competitive pressures. The Company’s stock price may become highly volatile, and investors may not be able to sell their shares at their desired prices, or at all. The Company’s stock price may change dramatically when buyers seeking to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock exceed the shares available on the market, or when there are no buyers to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock when shareholders are trying to sell their shares. The Company’s common stock has historically been “thinly” traded, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing shares of Company common stock at prevailing prices at any given time may be relatively small. This may contribute to price volatility, as the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our shareholders may disproportionately influence share price and may prevent investors from selling their shares at or above their purchase price if there is not sufficient demand for the shares at the time of sale. The Company depends on key management, sales and marketing and technical personnel, the loss of whom could harm its businesses. The Company depends on key management and technical personnel. The loss of one or more key employees could materially and adversely affect the Company. The Company’s success also depends on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales and marketing and management personnel necessary for the maintenance and expansion of its activities. The Company faces strong competition for such personnel and may not be able to attract or retain such personnel. In addition, when the Company experiences periods with little or no profits, a decrease in compensation based on profits may make it difficult to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. To attract and retain executives and other key employees, the Company must provide a competitive compensation package. If the Company’s profits decrease, or if the Company’s total compensation package is not viewed as competitive, the Company’s ability to attract, retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened. The failure to successfully hire and retain executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations. The Company may not be able to reach acceptable terms for contracts negotiated with its labor unions and be subject to work stoppages or disruption of production. During 2023, union contracts covering approximately 21% of the Company’s total workforce will expire. The Company has been successful in negotiating new contracts over the years but cannot guarantee that will continue and the Company has, in the past experienced, and could in the future experience, temporary work stoppages during negotiation of such contracts. Failure to negotiate new union contracts, or any work stoppage that is prolonged, could result in the disruption of production, inability to deliver product, or a number of unforeseen circumstances, any of which could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition. 15Table of Contents Deterioration in the creditworthiness of several major customers could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, or results of operations.  Included as a significant asset on the Company’s balance sheet are accounts receivable from our customers. If several large customers become insolvent or are otherwise unable to pay for products or become unwilling or unable to make payments in a timely manner, it could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.  Although the Company is not dependent on any one customer, deterioration in several large customers at the same time could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition. One customer exceeded 14% of total accounts receivable for fiscal 2022 and one customer exceeded 10% of total accounts receivable for fiscal 2021.  The Company’s operating results may fluctuate, which makes the results of operations difficult to predict and could cause the results to fall short of expectations. The Company’s operating results may fluctuate because of several factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing the Company’s operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and past results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Quarterly, year to date, and annual costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues may differ significantly from historical or projected levels. Future operating results may fall below expectations. These types of events could cause the price of the Company’s stock to fall. New or existing U.S. or foreign laws and regulations could subject the Company to claims or otherwise impact the Company’s business, financial condition, or results of operations. The Company is subject to a variety of laws, regulations, rules, and policies in both the U.S. and foreign countries that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort, and can subject the Company to claims or other remedies. These laws, regulations, rules, and policies could relate to any of an array of issues including, but not limited to, environmental, tax, intellectual property, trade secrets, product liability, contracts, antitrust, employment, securities, import/export and unfair competition. These laws and regulations may differ in different jurisdictions and are subject to change. The cost of maintaining compliance under multiple and changing regulatory regimes, and expenditures that may be required to comply with new laws and regulations, may adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. In the event that the Company fails to comply with or violates applicable U.S. or foreign laws or regulations or customer policies, the Company could be subject to civil or criminal claims or proceedings that may result in monetary fines, penalties or other costs against the Company or its employees, which may adversely affect the Company’s operating results, financial condition, customer relations and ability to conduct its business. "
6,EML,EASTERN CO,2022-03-17,"ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company’s business. The Company’s business, financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks or additional risks not presently known to the Company, or by risks the Company currently deems immaterial, which may also adversely affect its business, financial condition, or results of operations. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the Company has correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting its business or that information publicly available with respect to these matters is complete and correct. Risks Related to Our Business Our financial and operating performance may be adversely affected by epidemics and other health related issues.  As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has experienced and could continue to experience disruptions to its business, its operations, the delivery of its products and customer demand for its products, including the following:  ·The broader economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including resurgences, may continue to result in unfavorable operating earnings and cash flow generation in the months to follow. Current global economic conditions are highly volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in economic slowdowns that have caused and are likely to continue to cause contractions in some or all the markets we serve, which has led to and may continue to lead to decreased demand for the Company’s products, which in turn has, and may continue to negatively impact the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Other macroeconomic factors also remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, including economic uncertainty related to the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, and overall economic slowdowns, could reduce the Company’s sales or erode operating margin, in either case reducing earnings. In addition, volatile global economic conditions may cause foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which could result in increases or decreases in earnings and may adversely affect the value of the Company’s assets outside the United States. Increased pricing in response to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on demand for the Company’s products, which would affect sales and profits. Exchange rate fluctuations could also increase pricing pressure and impair the ability of the Company’s products to compete with products imported from regions with favorable exchange rates.    ·Shutdowns and other restrictions imposed to slow the spread and resurgence of COVID-19 have impacted and may continue to impact the prices and availability of certain of the raw materials used in the production of the Company’s products, which could impair the Company’s ability to procure the required raw materials for its operations or increase the cost of manufacturing its products. The Company may be unable to pass increases in the cost of raw materials on to its customers and could experience reductions to its profit margins. Also, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair the Company’s ability to meet production requirements in a timely manner or at all.    ·The Company’s management has been focused on mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees and operations, which has required and will continue to require a substantial investment of time and resources. This has resulted and can be expected to continue to result in a diversion of management attention and resources away from strategic initiatives, new business opportunities, potential acquisitions, and the overall profitability of our business, and the Company cannot predict how long this may continue.  7Table of Contents  ·The economic downturn has resulted and could continue to result in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets exceeding their fair value, which has required and could continue to require the Company to recognize asset impairment.    ·To the extent the Company draws under the revolving portion of the Credit Agreement, debt of the Company would increase. Such an increase in indebtedness could adversely affect the Company’s financial results or ability to incur additional debt and could negatively impact credit ratings. The continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including any resurgences, could also negatively impact the Company’s compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement or the interest rate of borrowings under the Credit Agreement. In addition, as a result of the risks described above, the Company may in the future be required to raise additional debt or equity financing, and the availability, terms and cost of such financing would depend on, among other things, global economic conditions, conditions in the global financing markets, trading prices of the Company’s common stock, the credit ratings of the Company, and the outlook for the industries in which the Company operates, all of which could be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the extent of any resurgences. There can be no assurance that such financing would be available on acceptable terms, in sufficient quantities, or at all.    ·Pension plan funded status, the ratio of plan assets over plan liabilities, is largely influenced by current market conditions. To the extent asset returns and interest rates, which are used to discount future plan benefits, change from prior measurement periods, the plan’s funded ratio has the potential to change significantly. Indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility. As of January 1, 2022, the Company had $71,314,000 in total consolidated indebtedness. Subject to restrictions contained in the Credit Agreement, the Company may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions. The level of indebtedness and servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operation and business strategy. For example, the indebtedness could:  ·Place the Company at a competitive disadvantage relative to the Company’s competitors, some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources; ·Limit the Company’s ability to borrow additional funds; ·Limit the Company’s ability to complete future acquisitions; ·Limit the Company’s ability to pay dividends; ·Limit the Company’s ability to make capital expenditures; and ·Increase the Company’s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. The Company’s ability to make scheduled principal payments, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy other debt obligations will depend upon future operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond the Company’s control. In addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or the issuance of equity would be available to the Company on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of the Company’s debt. If the Company is unable to service its indebtedness, the business, financial condition, and results of operation would be materially adversely affected. The Company’s credit facility contains covenants requiring the Company to achieve certain financial and operations results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. The Company’s ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in its credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and the Company may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or the Company’s inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in our credit facility could result in an event of default under such credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility and/or the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our credit facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, the Company’s assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under our credit facility or the Company’s other indebtedness. In addition, the Company’s growth strategy involves expanding sales of its products into foreign markets. There is no guarantee that the Company’s products will be accepted by foreign customers or how long it may take to develop sales of the Company’s products in these foreign markets.  8Table of Contents The phaseout of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of LIBOR with a different reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it would phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. In December 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration (the “IBA”) announced a market consultation regarding the extension of US dollar LIBOR tenors through June 30, 2023, which the FCA supports. On March 5, 2021, the IBA released its feedback statement reporting the results of the market consultation. Pursuant to its feedback statement, the IBA intends to cease publication of all settings of non-US dollar LIBOR and only the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings on December 31, 2021, with the publication of the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings being discontinued after June 30, 2023. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), a financial industry group convened by the Federal Reserve Board, has recommended the use of SOFR to replace LIBOR. The difference between LIBOR and SOFR is that LIBOR is a forward-looking rate which means the interest rate is set at the beginning of the period with payment due at the end. SOFR is a backward-looking overnight rate which has implications for how interest and other payments are based. Changes in the method of calculating the replacement of LIBOR with a fallback rate (effectively SOFR plus a spread adjustment) will become effective in June 2023 unless adopted earlier. The effect of this change is still unknown and could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, cash flow, and liquidity. Risks Related to Competition and Global Operations The Company’s business is subject to risks associated with conducting business overseas. International operations could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection measures, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, differing intellectual property rights and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs. Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies could result in increases or decreases in earnings and may adversely affect the value of the Company’s assets outside the United States. The Company’s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations. These trade agreements could impose requirements that adversely affect the Company’s business, such as, but not limited to, setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into the Company’s key markets in North America. The Company’s ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the United States or other countries. These issues could delay importation of products or require the Company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial conditions, or results of operations. The Company is also subject to the impacts of political, economic, and social instability. For example, the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit,” was completed on December 31, 2020. There remains significant uncertainty about the impact of Brexit on the free movement of goods, services, and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and Brexit could result in increased legal and regulatory complexities, as well as potential higher costs of conducting business in Europe. The uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom’s withdrawal and its consequences, as well as any deterioration in economic conditions, could adversely impact consumer and investor confidence, and the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and retail products, including our products. Any of these effects, among others, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Additionally, Brexit has contributed to the volatility of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which the Company conducts business. Because the Company translates revenue denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars for its financial statements, during periods of a volatile U.S. dollar, the Company’s reported earnings from foreign operations are affected. As a result of Brexit, there may be further periods of volatility in the currencies in which the Company conducts business. Supply chain disruptions, delays in production, and forecast inaccuracies could affect our ability to meet customer demand, lead to higher costs, result in excess inventory, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  Raw materials needed to manufacture products are obtained from numerous suppliers. Under normal market conditions, these raw materials are readily available on the open market from a variety of producers. However, from time to time, the prices and availability of these raw materials fluctuate due to the impact of inflation, as well as changes in existing and expected rates of inflation, which could impair the Company’s ability to procure the required raw materials for its operations or increase the cost of manufacturing its products. If the price of raw materials increases, the Company may be unable to pass these increases on to its customers and could experience reductions to its profit margins. Additionally, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair the Company’s ability to meet production requirements in a timely manner or at all.  9Table of Contents The Company faces active global competition and if it does not compete effectively, its business may suffer. The Company encounters competition in all its business operations, and imports from Asia and Latin America with favorable currency exchange rates and low-cost labor have resulted in pricing pressure. The Company competes with other companies that offer comparable products or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses. To remain profitable and defend market share, the Company must continue to offer high quality custom engineered products on a timely basis, deploy internal engineering resources, maintain cost-effective manufacturing capabilities through its wholly owned Asian subsidiaries, expand its product lines through product development and acquisitions, and maintain sufficient inventory for fast turnaround of customer orders. The Company may not be able to compete effectively on all these fronts and with all its competitors, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profit margins. In addition, the Company may have to reduce prices on its products and services, or make other concessions, to stay competitive and retain market share. Price reductions taken by the Company in response to customer and competitive pressures, as well as price reductions and promotional actions taken to drive demand that may not result in anticipated sales levels, could also negatively impact the Company’s business. If tariffs on imported Chinese products are further expanded to include additional products and the tariff is reinstated to 25%, our cost of raw materials may increase, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company obtains raw materials used in the production of its products from domestic, Asian affiliated and nonaffiliated sources. On January 15, 2020, the U.S. and China signed the U.S.-China Phase One trade deal which, among other things, rolls back tariffs on $120 billion of Chinese products from 15% to 7.5% effective February 14, 2020. The U.S. agreed not to proceed with the 15% tariffs on $160 billion of consumer goods which were scheduled to take effect December 15, 2019. However, the 25% tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports will remain in effect subject to further reductions depending on the progress of future negotiations. If China does not follow through on its agreed upon commitments and tariffs are reinstated on $550 billion of Chinese products at the 25% rate, it could result in a loss of business and possible reduced margins for the Company if the tariffs cannot be fully offset by higher selling prices. Changes in competition in the markets that the Company services could impact revenues and earnings. Any change in competition may result in lost market share or reduced prices, which could result in reduced profits and margins. This may impair the ability to grow or even maintain current levels of revenues and earnings. The loss of certain customers could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, or results of operations until such business is replaced, and no assurances can be made that the Company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers. Risks Related to Acquisitions and Organic Growth The inability to develop new products could limit growth. Demand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new competitive products at favorable profit margins could adversely affect the Company’s performance and prospects for future growth, and the Company would not be positioned to maintain current levels of revenues and earnings. The uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products, such as the market demands and the costs of development and production, may impede the successful development and introduction of new products. Acceptance of the new products may not meet sales expectations due to several factors, such as the Company’s potential inability to accurately predict market demand or to resolve technical issues in a timely and cost-effective manner. Additionally, the inability to develop new products on a timely basis could result in the loss of business to competitors.  10Table of Contents The inability to identify or complete acquisitions could limit growth. The Company’s future growth may partly depend on its ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses. The Company intends to seek additional acquisition opportunities, both to expand into new markets and to enhance the Company’s position in existing markets. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate terms, obtain financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets. Once acquired, operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability. Acquisitions involve risk, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns. Although the Company’s management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there can be no assurances that the Company’s management will properly ascertain all such risks. In addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial debt and other expenses. Future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. Difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions of any businesses we may acquire in the future. We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, and the success of any such acquisitions depends on our ability to combine the acquired business with our existing business in a manner that does not disrupt our and the acquired business’s ongoing relationships with customers, suppliers, and employees. Our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, including risk of impairment; (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into the Company simultaneously and on schedule or to achieve expected synergies and (iii) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, cybersecurity and compliance issues, labor relations difficulties or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, or insurance or indemnities. Risks Related to Technology and Information Security Our technology is important to the Company’s success and the failure to protect this technology could put the Company at a competitive disadvantage. Some of the Company’s products rely on proprietary technology; therefore, the Company believes that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of its business. Despite the Company’s efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use the Company’s products or technology. Actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and the Company makes no assurances that any such actions will be successful. In addition to the United States, we have applied for intellectual property protection in other jurisdictions with respect to certain innovations and new products, product features, and processes. The laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business, or contemplate doing business in the future, do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as U.S. law. As a result, these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products, services, and brands in foreign jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our financial performance. We may also encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our licensed and owned intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions. For example, China currently affords less protection to a company’s intellectual property than some other jurisdictions. As such, the lack of strong patent and other intellectual property protection in China may significantly increase our vulnerability regarding unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property and undermine our competitive position. Proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.  11Table of Contents The Company relies on information and technology for many of its business operations, which could fail and cause disruption to the Company’s business operations. The Company’s business operations are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to securely transmit, process and store electronic information and to communicate among its locations around the world and with clients and vendors. A shut-down of, or inability to access, one or more of the Company’s facilities, a power outage, or a failure of one or more of the Company’s information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair the Company’s ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. Computer viruses, cyberattacks, other external hazards and human error could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information, corruption of data or operational disruption. If sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, system failure, service denial or data loss and damage could result in a deterioration of the Company’s ability to write and process orders, provide customer service, or perform other necessary business functions. A breach in the security of the Company’s software could harm its reputation, result in a loss of current and potential customers, and subject the Company to material claims, which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition. If the Company’s security measures are breached, an unauthorized party may obtain access to the Company’s data or users’ or customers’ data. In addition, cyber-attacks and similar acts could lead to interruptions and delays in customer processing or a loss or breach of a customer’s data. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable, or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm the Company’s business is likely to increase as the Company expands the number of web-based products we offer, the services we provide, and our global operations. Regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with the Company’s data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that the Company change its data practices, which could have an adverse effect on its business and results of operations. Any security breaches for which the Company is, or is perceived to be, responsible, in whole or in part, could subject us to legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations, which could harm the Company’s reputation and result in significant litigation costs and damage awards or settlement amounts. Any imposition of liability, particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage, could materially harm our operating results and financial condition. Security breaches also could cause the Company to lose current and potential customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Moreover, the Company may be required to expend significant financial and other resources to further protect against security breaches or to rectify problems caused by any security breach. Litigation, Compliance and Regulatory Risks Delays in, or disagreements with the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm regarding, the Company’s evaluation of its internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Company’s stock or its borrowing ability. In addition, future changes in operating conditions could result in inadequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company is an “accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act and is thus required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 requires the Company to include in its report management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal period for which the Company is filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K. This report must also include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that the Company has identified. Additionally, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm is required to issue a report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and their evaluation of the operating effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s assessment requires it to make subjective judgments, and the independent registered public accounting firm may not agree with the Company’s assessment. If the Company or its independent registered public accounting firm were unable to complete the assessments within the period prescribed by Section 404 and thus be unable to conclude that the internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in the Company’s reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Company’s common stock or impact the Company’s borrowing ability. In addition, changes in operating conditions and changes in compliance with policies and procedures currently in place may result in inadequate internal control over financial reporting in the future.  12Table of Contents Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase the Company’s expenses and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition. The Company’s operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. These laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. The Company must conform its operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which the Company’s businesses operate as these requirements change. The Company uses and generates hazardous substances and wastes in its operations and, as a result, could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury. The Company has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations. In connection with the Company’s acquisitions, the Company may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which it may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require the Company to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes in climate may increase the frequency and intensity of adverse weather patterns and may negatively impact our business. Natural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-political events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons, weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events, such as war, civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. The Company could be subject to litigation, which could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, or results of operations.  From time to time, the Company’s operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, and environmental and employment matters, which are defended and settled in the ordinary course of business. Any litigation to which the Company may be subject could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, or results of operations. See Item 3 – Legal Proceedings of this Form 10-K for a discussion of current litigation. The Company could be subject to additional tax liabilities. The Company is subject to income tax laws of the United States, its states, and municipalities and those of other foreign jurisdictions in which the Company has business operations. These laws are complex and subject to interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment and interpretation are required in determining the Company’s worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of business, transactions arise where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although the Company believes that our tax estimates are reasonable, the outcome of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Based on the status of a given tax audit or related litigation, a material effect on the Company’s income tax provision or net income may result during the period or periods from the initial recognition of a particular matter in the Company’s reported financial results to the final closure of that tax audit or settlement of related litigation when the ultimate tax and related cash flow is known with certainty.  13Table of Contents General Risk Factors
 The Company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets may become impaired, which could require a significant charge to earnings be recognized. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually. Future operating results used in the assumptions, such as sales or profit forecasts, may not materialize, and the Company has been and could in the future be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment is determined, resulting in an unfavorable impact on our results of operations. Approximately $1.0 million of goodwill was impaired and written off in December 2020 in connection with closing the operations of Eberhard Hardware Manufacturing Ltd. In Ontario, Canada (“Eberhard Hardware”). The Company may need additional capital in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. From time-to-time, the Company has historically relied on outside financing to fund expanded operations, capital expenditure programs and acquisitions. The Company may require additional capital in the future to fund operations or strategic opportunities. The Company cannot be assured that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, the terms of available financing may place limits on the Company’s financial and operating flexibility. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient capital in the future, the Company may not be able to expand or acquire complementary businesses and may not be able to continue to develop new products or otherwise respond to changing business conditions or competitive pressures. The Company’s stock price may become highly volatile. The Company’s stock price may change dramatically when buyers seeking to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock exceed the shares available on the market, or when there are no buyers to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock when shareholders are trying to sell their shares. The Company depends on key management and technical personnel, the loss of whom could harm its businesses. The Company depends on key management and technical personnel. The loss of one or more key employees could materially and adversely affect the Company. The Company’s success also depends on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales and marketing and management personnel necessary for the maintenance and expansion of its activities. The Company faces strong competition for such personnel and may not be able to attract or retain such personnel. In addition, when the Company experiences periods with little or no profits, a decrease in compensation based on profits may make it difficult to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. To attract and retain executives and other key employees, the Company must provide a competitive compensation package. If the Company’s profits decrease, or if the Company’s total compensation package is not viewed as competitive, the Company’s ability to attract, retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened. The failure to successfully hire and retain executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations. The Company may not be able to reach acceptable terms for contracts negotiated with its labor unions and be subject to work stoppages or disruption of production. During 2022, union contracts covering approximately 11% of the Company’s total workforce will expire. The Company has been successful in negotiating new contracts over the years but cannot guarantee that will continue. Failure to negotiate new union contracts could result in the disruption of production, inability to deliver product, or a number of unforeseen circumstances, any of which could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.  Deterioration in the creditworthiness of several major customers could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, or results of operations. Included as a significant asset on the Company’s balance sheet are accounts receivable from our customers. If several large customers become insolvent or are otherwise unable to pay for products or become unwilling or unable to make payments in a timely manner, it could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition. Although the Company is not dependent on any one customer, deterioration in several large customers at the same time could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition. One customer exceeded 10% of total accounts receivable for 2021 and one customer exceeded 10% of total accounts receivable for 2020.  14Table of Contents The Company’s operating results may fluctuate, which makes the results of operations difficult to predict and could cause the results to fall short of expectations. The Company’s operating results may fluctuate because of several factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing the Company’s operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and past results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Quarterly, year to date, and annual costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues may differ significantly from historical or projected levels. Future operating results may fall below expectations. These types of events could cause the price of the Company’s stock to fall. New or existing U.S. or foreign laws could subject the Company to claims or otherwise impact the Company’s business, financial condition, or results of operations. The Company is subject to a variety of laws in both the U.S. and foreign countries that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort, and can subject the Company to claims or other remedies. "
11,EML,EASTERN CO,2021-03-16,"ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company’s business. The Company’s business, financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks or additional risks not presently known to the Company, or by risks the Company currently deems immaterial, which may also adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the Company has correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting its business or that information publicly available with respect to these matters is complete and correct.  Risks Related to Our Business The Company’s business has been and is expected to continue to be negatively impacted by the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has experienced and could continue to experience disruptions to its business, its operations, the delivery of its products and customer demand for its products, including the following:  ·The Company has operations in Shanghai and Dongguan, China that were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in the first six months of 2020. The virus led to a chain of events that interfered with our ability, and the ability of certain suppliers of ours, to conduct business. We source approximately 10% of our products and components from China. As a result of government mandated shutdowns at our facilities, and those of certain suppliers in China, many of the products that we ordered were delayed by approximately four to six weeks, which resulted in delays in our product shipments to our customers through May 2020. These delays had an adverse impact on our business, operations, fulfillment of production requirements and operating results. There may be similar delays in the future as a result of resurgences of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have an adverse impact on our business, operations, fulfillment of production requirements and operating results.  8Table of Contents   ·By mid-March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the United States, which precipitated the closure by government authorities of non-essential businesses. The majority of the Company’s businesses were deemed essential and accordingly remained open, but at reduced levels. This reduction in operations exacerbated delays in delivery of customer orders in the second and third quarters of 2020. Any resurgence of COVID-19 could result in reduced operations and could impair the Company’s ability to meet production requirements in a timely manner or at all. These effects have had and could to continue to have an adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results.  ·Many of the Company’s customers in both automotive/transportation and non-automotive/transportation markets experienced varying degrees of shutdowns beginning in the last week of March 2020, and, on a case-by-case basis, began to reopen at various dates beginning in May 2020. These temporary shutdowns have had an adverse impact on demand for our products. A sustained decrease in demand would negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the operations, financial results and finances of many of our customers, which has impacted and could continue to impact customer payment cycles and payments due from customers.    ·The broader economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including resurgences, may continue to result in unfavorable operating earnings and cash flow generation in the months to follow. Current global economic conditions are highly volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in economic slowdowns that have caused and are likely to continue to cause contractions in some or all of the markets we serve, which has led to and may continue to lead to decreased demand for the Company’s products, which in turn has, and may continue to negatively impact the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Other macroeconomic factors also remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, including economic uncertainty related to the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, and overall economic slowdowns, could reduce the Company’s sales or erode operating margin, in either case reducing earnings. In addition, volatile global economic conditions may cause foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which could result in increases or decreases in earnings and may adversely affect the value of the Company’s assets outside the United States. Increased pricing in response to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on demand for the Company’s products, which would affect sales and profits. Exchange rate fluctuations could also increase pricing pressure and impair the ability of the Company’s products to compete with products imported from regions with favorable exchange rates.    ·Shutdowns and other restrictions imposed to slow the spread and resurgence of COVID-19 have impacted and may continue to impact the prices and availability of certain of the raw materials used in the production of the Company’s products, which could impair the Company’s ability to procure the required raw materials for its operations or increase the cost of manufacturing its products. The Company may be unable to pass increases in the cost of raw materials on to its customers and could experience reductions to its profit margins. Also, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair the Company’s ability to meet production requirements in a timely manner or at all.    ·The Company’s management has been focused on mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees and operations, which has required and will continue to require a substantial investment of time and resources. This has resulted and can be expected to continue to result in a diversion of management attention and resources away from strategic initiatives, new business opportunities, potential acquisitions, and the overall profitability of our business, and the Company cannot predict how long this may continue.    ·The economic downturn has resulted and could continue to result in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets exceeding their fair value, which has required and could continue to require the Company to recognize asset impairment.  9Table of Contents  ·To the extent the Company draws under the revolving portion of the Credit Agreement, debt of the Company would increase. Such an increase in indebtedness could adversely affect the Company’s financial results or ability to incur additional debt and could negatively impact credit ratings. The continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including any resurgences, could also negatively impact the Company’s compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement or the interest rate of borrowings under the Credit Agreement. In addition, as a result of the risks described above, the Company may in the future be required to raise additional debt or equity financing, and the availability, terms and cost of such financing would depend on, among other things, global economic conditions, conditions in the global financing markets, trading prices of the Company’s common stock, the credit ratings of the Company, and the outlook for the industries in which the Company operates, all of which could be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the extent of any resurgences. There can be no assurance that such financing would be available on acceptable terms, in sufficient quantities, or at all.    ·Pension plan funded status, the ratio of plan assets over plan liabilities, is largely influenced by current market conditions. To the extent asset returns and interest rates, which are used to discount future plan benefits, change from prior measurement periods, the plan’s funded ratio has the potential to change significantly.   The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve rapidly, and additional material impacts and disruptions are likely to occur. The factors described above, which may worsen, and other factors that the Company cannot predict, can be expected to have a material adverse impact on the business, operations, financial results and capital resources of the Company. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company is highly uncertain and subject to change and will depend on future developments, which cannot be accurately predicted, including, but limited to: (i) the duration of the pandemic, including: (a) the extent of resurgences particularly in those regions that were previously impacted, but are now reopening, (b) new outbreaks in the regions previously unaffected and (c) how quickly and to what extent normal economic activity can resume; (ii) additional or modified government actions; (iii) the timing of vaccine distribution and the development and distribution of effective treatments for COVID-19; (iv) new information that may emerge concerning the severity and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and (v) the actions taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic or address its impact in the short and long term, among others. We do not yet know and cannot predict the full extent of impacts on the business, operations, financial results and capital resources of the Company. Our financial and operating performance may be adversely affected by epidemics and other health related issues.  Our business and financial and operating performance have been and are expected to continue to be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and could be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of other epidemics and other health related issues. As a result of the ongoing novel coronavirus, the Company’s operations in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan experienced a slowdown or temporary suspension in production. Our business could be materially and adversely affected in the event of another slowdown or suspension for a long period of time. During such epidemic outbreak, China, Hong Kong or Taiwan may adopt certain hygiene measures similar to those adopted in response to COVID-19, including quarantining visitors from places where any of the contagious diseases are rampant. Those restrictive measures may adversely affect and slow down economic development during that period. Any prolonged restrictive measures in order to control the contagious disease or other adverse public health developments in China, Hong Kong or Taiwan may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility. As of January 2, 2021, the Company had $88,694,000 in total consolidated indebtedness. Subject to restrictions contained in the Credit Agreement, the Company may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions. The level of indebtedness and servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operation and business strategy. For example, the indebtedness could:   ·Place the Company at a competitive disadvantage relative to the Company’s competitors, some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources; ·Limit the Company’s ability to borrow additional funds; ·Limit the Company’s ability to complete future acquisitions; ·Limit the Company’s ability to pay dividends; ·Limit the Company’s ability to make capital expenditures; and ·Increase the Company’s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.  10Table of Contents The Company’s ability to make scheduled principal payments, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy other debt obligations will depend upon future operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond the Company’s control. In addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or the issuance of equity would be available to the Company on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of the Company’s debt. If the Company is unable to service its indebtedness, the business, financial condition and results of operation would be materially adversely affected.  The Company’s credit facility contains covenants requiring the Company to achieve certain financial and operations results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. The Company’s ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in its credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and the Company may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or the Company’s inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in our credit facility could result in an event of default under such credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility and/or the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our credit facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, the Company’s assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under our credit facility or the Company’s other indebtedness.  In addition, the Company’s growth strategy involves expanding sales of its products into foreign markets. There is no guarantee that the Company’s products will be accepted by foreign customers or how long it may take to develop sales of the Company’s products in these foreign markets. The phaseout of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of LIBOR with a different reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it would phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The ICE Benchmark Administration (the “IBA”) recently announced market consultation regarding the extension of US dollar LIBOR tenors through June 30, 2023 which the FCA supports. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the “ARRC”), a financial industry group convened by the Federal Reserve Board has recommended the use of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) to replace LIBOR. The difference between LIBOR and SOFR is that LIBOR is a forward-looking rate which means the interest rate is set at the beginning of the period with payment due at the end. SOFR is a backward-looking overnight rate which have implications for how interest and other payments are based. Changes in the method of calculating the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative rate or benchmark are still in flux and once an alternative rate or benchmark is adopted, may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs. This could materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We cannot predict the effect of the potential changes to LIBOR or the establishment and use of alternative rates or benchmarks at this time. We are working with our senior lender and may need to renegotiate our credit facilities as LIBOR phases out in June 2023. Risks Related to Competition and Global Operations The Company’s business is subject to risks associated with conducting business overseas. International operations could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection measures, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, differing intellectual property rights and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs. Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies could result in increases or decreases in earnings and may adversely affect the value of the Company’s assets outside the United States. The Company’s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations. These trade agreements could impose requirements that adversely affect the Company’s business, such as, but not limited to, setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into the Company’s key markets in North America.  The Company’s ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the United States or other countries. These issues could delay importation of products or require the Company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial conditions or results of operations.   11Table of Contents   The Company is also subject to the impacts of political, economic and social instability. For example, the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit,” was completed on December 31, 2020. There remains significant uncertainty about the impact of Brexit on the free movement of goods, services, and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and Brexit could result in increased legal and regulatory complexities, as well as potential higher costs of conducting business in Europe. The uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom’s withdrawal and its consequences, as well as any deterioration in economic conditions, could adversely impact consumer and investor confidence, and the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and retail products, including our products. Any of these effects, among others, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Additionally, Brexit has contributed to the volatility of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which the Company conducts business. Because the Company translates revenue denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars for its financial statements, during periods of a volatile U.S. dollar, the Company’s reported earnings from foreign operations are affected. As a result of Brexit, there may be further periods of volatility in the currencies in which the Company conducts business. Increases in the price or reduced availability of raw materials could increase the cost of raw materials, decrease profit margins or impair the Company’s ability to meet production requirements on time or at all. Raw materials needed to manufacture products are obtained from numerous suppliers. Under normal market conditions, these raw materials are readily available on the open market from a variety of producers. However, from time to time, the prices and availability of these raw materials fluctuate, which could impair the Company’s ability to procure the required raw materials for its operations or increase the cost of manufacturing its products. If the price of raw materials increases, the Company may be unable to pass these increases on to its customers and could experience reductions to its profit margins. Also, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair the Company’s ability to meet production requirements in a timely manner or at all. The Company faces active global competition and if it does not compete effectively, its business may suffer. The Company encounters competition in all of its business segments, and imports from Asia and Latin America with favorable currency exchange rates and low-cost labor have resulted in pricing pressure. The Company competes with other companies that offer similar products or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses. To remain profitable and defend market share, the Company must continue to offer high quality custom engineered products on a timely basis, deploy internal engineering resources, maintain cost-effective manufacturing capabilities through its wholly owned Asian subsidiaries, expand its product lines through product development and acquisitions, and maintain sufficient inventory for fast turnaround of customer orders. The Company may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts and with all of its competitors, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profit margins. In addition, the Company may have to reduce prices on its products and services, or make other concessions, to stay competitive and retain market share. Price reductions taken by the Company in response to customer and competitive pressures, as well as price reductions and promotional actions taken to drive demand that may not result in anticipated sales levels, could also negatively impact the Company’s business. If tariffs on imported Chinese products are further expanded to include additional products and the tariff is reinstated to 25%, our cost of raw materials may increase, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company obtains raw materials used in the production of its products from domestic, Asian affiliated and nonaffiliated sources. On January 15, 2020, the U.S. and China signed the U.S.-China Phase One trade deal which, among other things, rolls back tariffs on $120 billion of Chinese products from 15% to 7.5% effective February 14, 2020. The U.S. agreed not to proceed with the 15% tariffs on $160 billion of consumer goods which were scheduled to take effect December 15, 2019. However, the 25% tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports will remain in effect subject to further reductions depending on the progress of future negotiations. If China does not follow through its agreed upon commitments and tariffs are reinstated on $550 billion of Chinese products at the 25% rate, it could result in a loss of business and possible reduced margins for the Company, if the tariffs cannot be fully offset by higher selling prices.  12Table of Contents  Changes in competition in the markets that the Company services could impact revenues and earnings. Any change in competition may result in lost market share or reduced prices, which could result in reduced profits and margins. This may impair the ability to grow or even maintain current levels of revenues and earnings. The loss of certain customers could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations until such business is replaced, and no assurances can be made that the Company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers. Risks Related to Acquisitions and Organic Growth The inability to develop new products could limit growth. Demand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new competitive products at favorable profit margins could adversely affect the Company’s performance and prospects for future growth, and the Company would not be positioned to maintain current levels of revenues and earnings. The uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products, such as the market demands and the costs of development and production, may impede the successful development and introduction of new products. Acceptance of the new products may not meet sales expectations due to several factors, such as the Company’s potential inability to accurately predict market demand or to resolve technical issues in a timely and cost-effective manner. Additionally, the inability to develop new products on a timely basis could result in the loss of business to competitors.  The inability to identify or complete acquisitions could limit growth. The Company’s future growth may partly depend on its ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses. The Company intends to seek additional acquisition opportunities, both to expand into new markets and to enhance the Company’s position in existing markets. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate terms, obtain financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets. Once acquired, operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability.  Acquisitions involve risk, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns. Although the Company’s management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there can be no assurances that the Company’s management will properly ascertain all such risks. In addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial debt and other expenses. Future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. Difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions of any businesses we may acquire in the future. We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, and the success of any such acquisitions depends on our ability to combine the acquired business with our existing business in a manner that does not disrupt our and the acquired business’s ongoing relationships with customers, suppliers and employees. Our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, including risk of impairment; (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into the Company simultaneously and on schedule or to achieve expected synergies and (iii) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, cybersecurity and compliance issues, labor relations difficulties or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, or insurance or indemnities.  13Table of Contents Risks Related to Technology and Information Security Our technology is important to the Company’s success and the failure to protect this technology could put the Company at a competitive disadvantage.  Some of the Company’s products rely on proprietary technology; therefore, the Company believes that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of its business. Despite the Company’s efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use the Company’s products or technology. Actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and the Company makes no assurances that any such actions will be successful. In addition to the United States, we have applied for intellectual property protection in other jurisdictions with respect to certain innovations and new products, product features, and processes. The laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business, or contemplate doing business in the future, do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as U.S. law. As a result, these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products, services, and brands in foreign jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our financial performance. We may also encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our licensed and owned intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions. For example, China currently affords less protection to a company’s intellectual property than some other jurisdictions. As such, the lack of strong patent and other intellectual property protection in China may significantly increase our vulnerability regarding unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property and undermine our competitive position. Proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. The Company relies on information and technology for many of its business operations, which could fail and cause disruption to the Company’s business operations. The Company’s business operations are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to securely transmit, process and store electronic information and to communicate among its locations around the world and with clients and vendors. A shut-down of, or inability to access, one or more of the Company’s facilities, a power outage or a failure of one or more of the Company’s information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair the Company’s ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. Computer viruses, cyberattacks, other external hazards and human error could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information, corruption of data or operational disruption. If sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, system failure, service denial or data loss and damage could result in a deterioration of the Company’s ability to write and process orders, provide customer service or perform other necessary business functions. A breach in the security of the Company’s software could harm its reputation, result in a loss of current and potential customers and subject the Company to material claims, which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition. If the Company’s security measures are breached, an unauthorized party may obtain access to the Company’s data or users’ or customers’ data. In addition, cyber-attacks and similar acts could lead to interruptions and delays in customer processing or a loss or breach of a customer’s data. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm the Company’s business is likely to increase as the Company expands the number of web-based products we offer, the services we provide, and our global operations. Regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with the Company’s data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that the Company change its data practices, which could have an adverse effect on its business and results of operations. Any security breaches for which the Company is, or is perceived to be, responsible, in whole or in part, could subject us to legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations, which could harm the Company’s reputation and result in significant litigation costs and damage awards or settlement amounts. Any imposition of liability, particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage, could materially harm our operating results and financial condition. Security breaches also could cause the Company to lose current and potential customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Moreover, the Company might be required to expend significant financial and other resources to further protect against security breaches or to rectify problems caused by any security breach.  14Table of Contents  Litigation, Compliance and Regulatory Risks Delays in, or disagreements with the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm regarding, the Company’s evaluation of its internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Company’s stock or its borrowing ability. In addition, future changes in operating conditions could result in inadequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company is an “accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act and is thus required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 requires the Company to include in its report management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal period for which the Company is filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K. This report must also include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that the Company has identified. Additionally, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm is required to issue a report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and their evaluation of the operating effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s assessment requires it to make subjective judgments, and the independent registered public accounting firm may not agree with the Company’s assessment. If the Company or its independent registered public accounting firm were unable to complete the assessments within the period prescribed by Section 404 and thus be unable to conclude that the internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in the Company’s reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Company’s common stock or impact the Company’s borrowing ability. In addition, changes in operating conditions and changes in compliance with policies and procedures currently in place may result in inadequate internal control over financial reporting in the future. Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase the Company’s expenses and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition. The Company’s operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. These laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. The Company must conform its operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which the Company’s businesses operate as these requirements change. The Company uses and generates hazardous substances and wastes in its operations and, as a result, could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury. The Company has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations. In connection with the Company’s acquisitions, the Company may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which it may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require the Company to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in climate may increase the frequency and intensity of adverse weather patterns and may negatively impact our business. Natural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-political events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons, weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events, such as war, civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.  15Table of Contents  The Company could be subject to litigation, which could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.     From time to time, the Company’s operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, and environmental and employment matters, which are defended and settled in the ordinary course of business. Any litigation to which the Company may be subject could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. See Item 3 – Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K for a discussion of current litigation. The Company could be subject to additional tax liabilities. The Company is subject to income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of other foreign jurisdictions in which the Company has business operations. These laws are complex and subject to interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment and interpretation are required in determining the Company’s worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of business, transactions arise where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although the Company believes that our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Based on the status of a given tax audit or related litigation, a material effect on the Company’s income tax provision or net income may result during the period or periods from the initial recognition of a particular matter in the Company’s reported financial results to the final closure of that tax audit or settlement of related litigation when the ultimate tax and related cash flow is known with certainty. General Risk Factors
 The Company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets may become impaired, which could require a significant charge to earnings to be recognized. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually. Future operating results used in the assumptions, such as sales or profit forecasts, may not materialize, and the Company has been and could in the future be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment is determined, resulting in an unfavorable impact on our results of operations. For example, approximately $1 million of goodwill was impaired and written off the books in December 2020 in connection with the closing of operations of Eberhard Hardware Manufacturing Ltd. in Ontario, Canada. Numerous assumptions are used in the evaluation of impairment, and there is no guarantee that the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm would reach the same conclusion as the Company or an independent valuation firm, which could result in a disagreement between management and the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm. The Company may need additional capital in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. From time-to-time, the Company has historically relied on outside financing to fund expanded operations, capital expenditure programs and acquisitions. The Company may require additional capital in the future to fund operations or strategic opportunities. The Company cannot be assured that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, the terms of available financing may place limits on the Company’s financial and operating flexibility. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient capital in the future, the Company may not be able to expand or acquire complementary businesses and may not be able to continue to develop new products or otherwise respond to changing business conditions or competitive pressures. The Company’s stock price may become highly volatile. The Company’s stock price may change dramatically when buyers seeking to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock exceed the shares available on the market, or when there are no buyers to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock when shareholders are trying to sell their shares. The Company depends on key management and technical personnel, the loss of whom could harm its businesses. The Company depends on key management and technical personnel. The loss of one or more key employees could materially and adversely affect the Company.   16Table of Contents   The Company’s success also depends on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales and marketing and management personnel necessary for the maintenance and expansion of its activities. The Company faces strong competition for such personnel and may not be able to attract or retain such personnel. In addition, when the Company experiences periods with little or no profits, a decrease in compensation based on profits may make it difficult to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. In order to attract and retain executives and other key employees, the Company must provide a competitive compensation package. If the Company’s profits decrease, or if the Company’s total compensation package is not viewed as competitive, the Company’s ability to attract, retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened. The failure to successfully hire and retain executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations. The Company may not be able to reach acceptable terms for contracts negotiated with its labor unions and be subject to work stoppages or disruption of production. During 2021, union contracts covering approximately 15% of the Company’s total workforce will expire. The Company has been successful in negotiating new contracts over the years, but cannot guarantee that will continue. Failure to negotiate new union contracts could result in the disruption of production, inability to deliver product or a number of unforeseen circumstances, any of which could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition. Deterioration in the creditworthiness of several major customers could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.  Included as a significant asset on the Company’s balance sheet are accounts receivable from our customers. If several large customers become insolvent or are otherwise unable to pay for products, or become unwilling or unable to make payments in a timely manner, it could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.  Although the Company is not dependent on any one customer, deterioration in several large customers at the same time could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition. One customer exceeded 10% of total accounts receivable for 2020 and one customer exceeded 10% of total accounts receivable for 2019.  The Company’s operating results may fluctuate, which makes the results of operations difficult to predict and could cause the results to fall short of expectations. The Company’s operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing the Company’s operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and past results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Quarterly, year to date and annual costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues may differ significantly from historical or projected levels. Future operating results may fall below expectations. These types of events could cause the price of the Company’s stock to fall. New or existing U.S. or foreign laws could subject the Company to claims or otherwise impact the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. The Company is subject to a variety of laws in both the U.S. and foreign countries that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and can subject the Company to claims or other remedies.  "
16,EML,EASTERN CO,2020-03-05,"ITEM 1A RISK FACTORSIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, the following risk factors should be    considered carefully in evaluating the Company’s business. The Company’s business, financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks or additional risks not presently known to the Company, or by    risks the Company currently deems immaterial, which may also adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations.  Additionally, there can be no assurance that the Company has correctly identified and appropriately assessed all    factors affecting its business or that information publicly available with respect to these matters is complete and correct.The Company’s business is subject to risks associated with conducting business overseas.International operations could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection measures, restrictions on repatriation    of earnings, differing intellectual property rights and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs. Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies could result in increases or    decreases in earnings and may adversely affect the value of the Company’s assets outside the United States. The Company’s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations. These trade agreements could impose    requirements that adversely affect the Company’s business, such as, but not limited to, setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into the Company’s key markets in North America.The Company’s ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect    transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the United States or other countries. These issues could delay importation of products or    require the Company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on the    Company’s business, financial conditions or results of operations.The Company is also subject to the impacts of political, economic and social instability. For example, the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European    Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit,” was completed on January 31, 2020, commencing a6 standstill transition period that is currently set to last until December 31, 2020.  During this transition period, the United Kingdom’s trading    relationship with the European Union will remain unchanged while the parties negotiate to agree on and implement a new trading relationship.  There remains significant uncertainty about how and when such final agreement will be reached, and the    withdrawal could significantly disrupt the free movement of goods, services, and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and result in increased legal and regulatory complexities, as well as potential higher costs of conducting    business in Europe. Brexit has also contributed to significant volatility and uncertainty in global stock markets and currency exchange rates, and such volatility could continue to occur. The uncertainty surrounding the terms of the United Kingdom’s    withdrawal and its consequences, as well as market volatility and any deterioration in economic conditions due to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, could adversely impact consumer and investor confidence, and the level of consumer purchases of    discretionary items and retail products, including our products. Any of these effects, among others, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Additionally, Brexit has resulted in the immediate strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which the Company conducts business.    Because the Company translates revenue denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars for its financial statements, during periods of a strengthening U.S. dollar, the Company’s reported earnings from foreign operations are reduced. As a result of    Brexit, there may be further periods of volatility in the currencies in which the Company conducts business.Our financial and operating performance may be adversely affected by epidemics and other health related issues.Our business and financial and operating performance could be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of epidemics including but not limited to the    novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and other health related issues. As a result of the ongoing novel coronavirus, the Company’s operations in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan are expected to experience a slowdown or temporary suspension in production. Our    business could be materially and adversely affected in the event that the slowdown or suspension continues for a long period of time. During such epidemic outbreak, China, Hong Kong or Taiwan may adopt certain hygiene measures, including quarantining    visitors from places where any of the contagious diseases were rampant. Those restrictive measures may adversely affect and slow down economic development during that period. Any prolonged restrictive measures in order to control the contagious disease    or other adverse public health developments in China, Hong Kong or Taiwan may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.As of December, 28, 2019, the Company had $98,765,000 in total consolidated indebtedness. Subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility, the    Company may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions. The level of indebtedness and servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operation and business    strategy. For example, the indebtedness could:•Place the Company at a competitive disadvantage relative to the Company’s competitors, some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources;•Limit our ability to borrow additional funds;•Limit our ability to complete future acquisitions;•Limit our ability to pay dividends;•Limit our ability to make capital expenditures; and•Increase the Company’s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.The Company’s ability to make scheduled principal payments, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy other debt obligations will    depend upon future operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond the Company’s control. In addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or the issuance of equity would be available to the Company on favorable terms for    the payment or refinancing of the Company’s debt. If the Company is unable to service its indebtedness, the business, financial condition and results of operation would be materially adversely affected.The Company’s credit facility contains covenants requiring the Company to achieve certain financial and operations results and maintain compliance with    specified financial ratios. The Company’s ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in its credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and the Company may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach    of these covenants or the Company’s inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in our credit facility could result in an event of default under such credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of 7 default under our credit facility and/or the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our credit    facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, the Company’s assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under our credit facility or the Company’s other indebtedness.In addition, the Company’s growth strategy involves expanding sales of its products into foreign markets. There is no guarantee that the Company’s products    will be accepted by foreign customers or how long it may take to develop sales of the Company’s products in these foreign markets.The phaseout of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of LIBOR with a different reference rate, may adversely    affect interest rates.On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it would phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is    unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021, or if alternative rates or benchmarks will be adopted. Changes in the method of calculating LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an    alternative rate or benchmark, may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs. This could materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We cannot predict the effect of the    potential changes to LIBOR or the establishment and use of alternative rates or benchmarks. We may need to renegotiate our revolving credit facility or incur other indebtedness, and changes in the method of calculating LIBOR, or the use of an    alternative rate or benchmark, may negatively impact the terms of such indebtedness. If changes are made to the method of calculating LIBOR or LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to amend certain contracts, including our revolving credit facility, and    cannot predict what alternative rate or benchmark would be negotiated. This may result in an increase to our interest expense.Increases in the price or reduced availability of raw materials could increase the cost of raw materials, decrease profit margins or    impair the Company’s ability to meet production requirements on time or at all.Raw materials needed to manufacture products are obtained from numerous suppliers. Under normal market conditions, these raw materials are readily available    on the open market from a variety of producers. However, from time to time, the prices and availability of these raw materials fluctuate, which could impair the Company’s ability to procure the required raw materials for its operations or increase the    cost of manufacturing its products. If the price of raw materials increases, the Company may be unable to pass these increases on to its customers and could experience reductions to its profit margins. Also, any decrease in the availability of raw    materials could impair the Company’s ability to meet production requirements in a timely manner or at all.The Company faces active global competition and if it does not compete effectively, its business may suffer.The Company encounters competition in all of its business segments, and imports from Asia and Latin America with favorable currency exchange rates and    low-cost labor have resulted in pricing pressure.  The Company competes with other companies that offer similar products or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses.  To remain profitable and defend market share, the Company must    continue to offer high quality custom engineered products on a timely basis, deploy internal engineering resources, maintain cost-effective manufacturing capabilities through its wholly owned Asian subsidiaries, expand its product lines through product    development and acquisitions, and maintain sufficient inventory for fast turnaround of customer orders. The Company may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts and with all of its competitors, and the failure to do so could have a    material adverse effect on its sales and profit margins.In addition, the Company may have to reduce prices on its products and services, or make other concessions, to stay competitive and retain market share.    Price reductions taken by the Company in response to customer and competitive pressures, as well as price reductions and promotional actions taken to drive demand that may not result in anticipated sales levels, could also negatively impact the    Company’s business.If tariffs on imported Chinese products are further expanded to include additional products and the tariff is reinstated to 25%, our cost    of raw materials may increase, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.8The Company obtains raw materials used in the production of its products from domestic, Asian affiliated and nonaffiliated sources.  On January 15, 2020,    the U.S. and China signed the U.S.-China Phase One trade deal which, among other things, rolls back tariffs on $120 billion of Chinese products from 15% to 7.5% effective February 14, 2020. The U.S. agreed not to proceed with the 15% tariffs on $160    billion of consumer goods which were scheduled to take effect December 15, 2019.  However, the 25% tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports will remain in effect subject to further reductions depending on the progress of future negotiations.  If    China does not follow through its agreed upon commitments and tariffs are reinstated on $550 billion of Chinese products at the 25% rate, it could result in a loss of business and possible reduced margins for the Company, if the tariffs cannot be    recovered in higher selling prices.The inability to develop new products could limit growth.Demand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new competitive products at favorable profit margins could adversely affect the Company’s    performance and prospects for future growth, and the Company would not be positioned to maintain current levels of revenues and earnings. The uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products, such as the market demands and the    costs of development and production, may impede the successful development and introduction of new products. Acceptance of the new products may not meet sales expectations due to several factors, such as the Company’s potential inability to accurately    predict market demand or to resolve technical issues in a timely and cost effective manner. Additionally, the inability to develop new products on a timely basis could result in the loss of business to competitors.The inability to identify or complete acquisitions could limit growth.The Company’s future growth may partly depend on its ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses. The Company intends to seek additional    acquisition opportunities, both to expand into new markets and to enhance the Company’s position in existing markets. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate    terms, obtain financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets. Once acquired, operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability.Acquisitions involve risk, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the    diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns. Although the Company’s management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there can be no assurances that the Company’s management will properly    ascertain all such risks. In addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial debt and other expenses. Future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity    securities. Difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, including the Big 3 Precision acquistion and any    businesses we may acquire in the future.We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a    timely basis, or at all, and the success of any such acquisitions depends on our ability to combine the acquired business with our existing business in a manner that does not disrupt our and the acquired business’s ongoing relationships with customers,    suppliers and employees. Our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, including risk of impairment; (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired    businesses into the Company simultaneously and on schedule or to achieve expected synergies and (iii) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, cybersecurity and compliance issues, labor relations difficulties or other problems in acquired businesses    for which we lack contractual protections, or insurance or indemnities.In particular, the Company may also be adversely impacted if it is unable to successfully combine its businesses with that of Big 3 Precision in a manner    that does not materially disrupt the existing relationships of either the Company or Big 3 Precision or adversely affect current revenues and investments in future growth.  Additionally, the Company may not be able to successfully achieve the level of    cost savings, revenue enhancements and synergies that it expects in connection with the acquisition.  If the Company is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of its acquisition of Big 3 Precision may not be    realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.Changes in competition in the markets that the Company services could impact revenues and earnings.9Any change in competition may result in lost market share or reduced prices, which could result in reduced profits and margins. This may impair the ability    to grow or even maintain current levels of revenues and earnings.  While the Company has an extensive customer base, loss of certain customers could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations until such    business is replaced, and no assurances can be made that the Company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers.The Company is required to evaluate its internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.The Company is an “accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act and is thus required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley    Act of 2002. Section 404 requires the Company to include in its report management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal period for which the Company is filing its Annual    Report on Form 10-K. This report must also include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that the Company has identified. Additionally, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm is required    to issue a report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and their evaluationof the operating effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s assessment requires it to make subjective judgments,    and the independent registered public accounting firm may not agree with the Company’s assessment. If the Company or its independent registered public accounting firm were unable to complete the assessments within the period prescribed by Section 404    and thus be unable to conclude that the internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in the Company’s reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Company’s    common stock or impact the Company’s borrowing ability. In addition, changes in operating conditions and changes in compliance with policies and procedures currently in place may result in inadequate internal control over financial reporting in the    future.Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase the Company’s expenses and adversely affect the Company’s financial    condition.The Company’s operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including air emissions, water discharges,    waste management and workplace safety. These laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution    emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. The Company must conform its operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which the Company’s businesses operate as    these requirements change.The Company uses and generates hazardous substances and wastes in its operations and, as a result, could be subject to potentially material liabilities    relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury. The Company has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations. In    connection with the Company’s acquisitions, the Company may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which it may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and    regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require the Company to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our    business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in climate may increase the frequency and intensity of adverse weather patterns and may negatively impact our business.Natural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-political events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The occurrence of one or more    natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons, weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise,    severe changes in climate and geo-political events, such as war, civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.Our technology is important to the Company’s success and the failure to protect this technology could put the Company at a competitive    disadvantage.10Some of the Company’s products rely on proprietary technology; therefore, the Company believes that the development and protection of intellectual property    rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of its business. Despite the Company’s efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized    parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use the Company’s products or technology. Actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and the Company makes no assurances that any such actions will    be successful.In addition to the United States, we have applied for intellectual property protection in other jurisdictions with respect to certain innovations and new    products, product features, and processes. The laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business, or contemplate doing business in the future, do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as U.S. law. As a    result, these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products, services, and brands in foreign jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our financial performance.  We may also encounter significant problems in protecting    and defending our licensed and owned intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions. For example, China currently affords less protection to a company’s intellectual property than some other jurisdictions. As such, the lack of strong patent and other    intellectual property protection in China may significantly increase our vulnerability regarding unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property and undermine our competitive position. Proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights    in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.The Company relies on information and technology for many of its business operations, which could fail and cause disruption to the    Company’s business operations.The Company’s business operations are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to securely transmit, process and store electronic    information and to communicate among its locations around the world and with clients and vendors. A shut-down of, or inability to access, one or more of the Company’s facilities, a power outage or a failure of one or more of the Company’s information    technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair the Company’s ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. Computer viruses, cyberattacks, other external hazards and human error could result in the misappropriation of    assets or sensitive information, corruption of data or operational disruption. If sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, system failure, service denial or data loss and damage could result in a deterioration of the Company’s ability to    write and process orders, provide customer service or perform other necessary business functions.A breach in the security of the Company’s software could harm its reputation, result in a loss of current and potential customers and    subject the Company to material claims, which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition.If the Company’s security measures are breached, an unauthorized party may obtain access to the Company’s data or users’ or customers’ data. In addition,    cyber-attacks and similar acts could lead to interruptions and delays in customer processing or a loss or breach of a customer’s data. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change    frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm the Company’s    business is likely to increase as the Company expands the number of web-based products we offer, the services we provide, and our global operations.Regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. In addition, the    interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with the Company’s    data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that the Company change its data practices, which could have an adverse effect on its business and results of operations.Any security breaches for which the Company is, or is perceived to be, responsible, in whole or in part, could subject us to legal claims or legal    proceedings, including regulatory investigations, which could harm the Company’s reputation and result in significant litigation costs and damage awards or settlement amounts. Any imposition of liability, particularly liability that is not covered by    insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage, could materially harm our operating results and financial condition. Security breaches also could cause the Company to lose current and potential customers, which could have an adverse effect on11our business. Moreover, the Company might be required to expend significant financial and other resources to further protect against security breaches or to    rectify problems caused by any security breach.The Company could be subject to litigation, which could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition or results    of operations.From time to time, the Company’s operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability,    personal injury, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, and environmental and employment matters, which are defended and settled in the ordinary course of business.  Any litigation to which the Company may be subject could have a    material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. See “ITEM 3 – LEGAL PROCEEDINGS” in this Form 10-K for a discussion of current litigation.The Company could be subject to additional tax liabilities.The Company is subject to income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of other foreign jurisdictions in which the Company    has business operations.  These laws are complex and subject to interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment and interpretation is required in determining the Company’s worldwide provision for    income taxes. In the ordinary course of business, transactions arise where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although the Company believes that our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and any related litigation    could be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Based on the status of a given tax audit or related litigation, a material effect on the Company’s income tax provision or net income may    result during the period or periods from the initial recognition of a particular matter in the Company’s reported financial results to the final closure of that tax audit or settlement of related litigation when the ultimate tax and related cash flow    is known with certainty.The Company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets may become impaired, which could require a significant charge to earnings to    be recognized.Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for    impairment at least annually. Future operating results used in the assumptions, such as sales or profit forecasts, may not materialize, and the Company could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the    period in which any impairment is determined, resulting in an unfavorable impact on our results of operations. Numerous assumptions are used in the evaluation of impairment, and there is no guarantee that the Company’s independent registered public    accounting firm would reach the same conclusion as the Company or an independent valuation firm, which could result in a disagreement between management and the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm.The Company may need additional capital in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.From time-to-time, the Company has historically relied on outside financing to fund expanded operations, capital expenditure programs and acquisitions. The    Company may require additional capital in the future to fund operations or strategic opportunities. The Company cannot be assured that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, the terms of available financing    may place limits on the Company’s financial and operating flexibility. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient capital in the future, the Company may not be able to expand or acquire complementary businesses and may not be able to continue to    develop new products or otherwise respond to changing business conditions or competitive pressures.The Company’s stock price may become highly volatile.The Company’s stock price may change dramatically when buyers seeking to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock exceed the shares available on the    market, or when there are no buyers to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock when shareholders are trying to sell their shares.The Company depends on key management and technical personnel, the loss of whom could harm its businesses.12The Company depends on key management and technical personnel. The loss of one or more key employees could materially and adversely affect the Company.The Company’s success also depends on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales and marketing and management personnel necessary for    the maintenance and expansion of its activities. The Company faces strong competition for such personnel and may not be able to attract or retain such personnel. In addition, when the Company experiences periods with little or no profits, a decrease in    compensation based on profits may make it difficult to attract and retain highly qualified personnel.In order to attract and retain executives and other key employees, the Company must provide a competitive compensation package, if the Company’s profits    decrease, or if the Company’s total compensation package is not viewed as competitive, the Company’s ability to attract, retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened. The failure to successfully hire and retain executives and key    employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations.The Company may not be able to reach acceptable terms for contracts negotiated with its labor unions and be subject to work stoppages or    disruption of production.During 2020, union contracts covering approximately 1% of the Company’s total workforce will expire.  The Company has been successful in negotiating new    contracts over the years, but cannot guarantee that will continue. Failure to negotiate new union contracts could result in the disruption of production, inability to deliver product or a number of unforeseen circumstances, any of which could have an    unfavorable material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.Deterioration in the creditworthiness of several major customers could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial    condition or results of operations.Included as a significant asset on the Company’s balance sheet are accounts receivable from our customers.  If several large customers become insolvent or    are otherwise unable to pay for products, or become unwilling or unable to make payments in a timely manner, it could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.Although the Company is not dependent on any one customer, deterioration in several large customers at the same time could have an unfavorable material    impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.  One customer exceeded 10% of total accounts receivable for 2019.  No customer exceeded 10% of total accounts receivable for 2018.The Company’s operating results may fluctuate, which makes the results of operations difficult to predict and could cause the results to    fall short of expectations.The Company’s operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control.  As a result, comparing the    Company’s operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and past results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.  Quarterly, year to date and annual costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues may    differ significantly from historical or projected levels.  Future operating results may fall below expectations.  These types of events could cause the price of the Company’s stock to fall.New or existing U.S. or foreign laws could subject the Company to claims or otherwise impact the Company’s business, financial condition    or results of operations.The Company is subject to a variety of laws in both the U.S. and foreign countries that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and    diversion of management time and effort and can subject the Company to claims or other remedies"
0,EML,EASTERN CO,2019-03-14,"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORSIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K and the exhibits hereto and the Company's other filings with the SEC, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company's business. The Company's business, financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks or additional risks not presently known to the Company, or by risks the Company currently deems immaterial. which may also adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations, such as: changes in the economy, including changes in inflation, tax rates, interest rates and currency exchange rates; risk associated with possible disruption in the Company's operations due to terrorism, cybersecurity threats and other manmade or natural disasters; future regulatory actions, legal issues or environmental matters; loss of, or changes in, executive management; and changes in accounting standards that are adverse to the Company.  Additionally, there can be no assurance that the Company has correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting its business or that information publicly available with respect to these matters is complete and correct.The Company's business is subject to risks associated with conducting business overseas.International operations could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection measures, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, differing intellectual property rights and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs. Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies could result in increases or decreases in earnings and may adversely affect the value of the Company's assets outside the United States. The Company's operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations. These trade agreements could impose requirements that adversely affect the Company's business, such as, but not limited to, setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into the Company's key markets in North America.The Company's ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the United States or other countries. These issues could delay importation of products or require the Company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on the Company's business, financial conditions or results of operations.Indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.As of December, 29, 2018, the Company had $28,675,000 in total consolidated indebtedness. Subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility, the Company may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions. The level of indebtedness and servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operation and business strategy. For example, the indebtedness could:·Place the Company at a competitive disadvantage relative to the Company's competitors, some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources;·Limit our ability to borrow additional funds;·Limit our ability to complete future acquisitions;·Limit our ability to pay dividends;·Limit our ability to make capital expenditures; and·Increase the Company's vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.The Company's ability to make scheduled principal payments, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy other debt obligations will depend upon future operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond the Company's6control. In addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or the issuance of equity would be available to the Company on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of the Company's debt. If the Company is unable to service its indebtedness, the business, financial condition and results of operation would be materially adversely affected.The Company's credit facility contains covenants requiring the Company to achieve certain financial and operations results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. The Company's ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in its credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and the Company may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or the Company's inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in our credit facility could result in an event of default under such credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility and/or the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our credit facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, the Company's assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under our credit facility or the Company's other indebtedness.In addition, the Company's growth strategy involves expanding sales of its products into foreign markets. There is no guarantee that the Company's products will be accepted by foreign customers or how long it may take to develop sales of the Company's products in these foreign markets.Increases in the price or reduced availability of raw materials.Raw materials needed to manufacture products are obtained from numerous suppliers. Under normal market conditions, these raw materials are readily available on the open market from a variety of producers. However, from time to time, the prices and availability of these raw materials fluctuate, which could impair the Company's ability to procure the required raw materials for its operations or increase the cost of manufacturing its products. If the price of raw materials increases, the Company may be unable to pass these increases on to its customers and could experience reductions to its profit margins. Also, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair the Company's ability to meet production requirements in a timely manner.If tariffs on imported Chinese products are further expanded to include an additional $267 billion of products and the tariff is increased to 25% from the current 10% our cost of raw materials may increase, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The Company obtains raw materials used in the production of its products from domestic, Asian affiliated and nonaffiliated sources.  Effective September 24, 2018, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (the ""USTR"") imposed 10% tariffs on approximately $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.  The impact of the 10% tariffs on Chinese produced goods has been negligible in 2018, as the majority of the tariffs have been recovered from our customers.  For 2019, the USTR anticipates the level of the additional tariffs to increase to 25% and could expand to include an additional $267 billion worth of Chinese imports.  If the proposed 25% tariff goes into effect in 2019 on Chinese purchased goods, it could result in a loss of business and possible reduced margins if the tariffs cannot be recovered in higher selling prices.Changes in competition in the markets that the Company services could impact revenues and earnings.Any change in competition may result in lost market share or reduced prices, which could result in reduced profits and margins. This may impair the ability to grow or even maintain current levels of revenues and earnings.  While the Company has an extensive customer base, loss of certain customers could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations until such business is replaced, and no assurances can be made that the Company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers.The Company is required to evaluate its internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.The Company is an ""accelerated filer"" as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act and is thus required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 requires the Company to include in its report management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal period for which the Company is filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K. This report must also include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that the Company has identified. Additionally, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is required to issue a report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting and their evaluation7of the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Company's assessment requires it to make subjective judgments, and the independent registered public accounting firm may not agree with the Company's assessment. If the Company or its independent registered public accounting firm were unable to complete the assessments within the period prescribed by Section 404 and thus be unable to conclude that the internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in the Company's reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Company's common stock or impact the Company's borrowing ability. In addition, changes in operating conditions and changes in compliance with policies and procedures currently in place may result in inadequate internal control over financial reporting in the future.The inability to develop new products could limit growth.Demand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new competitive products at favorable profit margins could adversely affect the Company's performance and prospects for future growth, and the Company would not be positioned to maintain current levels of revenues and earnings. The uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products, such as the market demands and the costs of development and production, may impede the successful development and introduction of new products. Acceptance of the new products may not meet sales expectations due to several factors, such as the Company's potential inability to accurately predict market demand or to resolve technical issues in a timely and cost effective manner. Additionally, the inability to develop new products on a timely basis could result in the loss of business to competitors.The inability to identify or complete acquisitions could limit growth.The Company's future growth may partly depend on its ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses. The Company intends to seek additional acquisition opportunities, both to expand into new markets and to enhance the Company's position in existing markets. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate terms, obtain financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets. Once acquired, operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability.Acquisitions involve risk, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. Although the Company's management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there can be no assurances that the Company's management will properly ascertain all such risks. In addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial debt and other expenses. Future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. Difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase the Company's expenses and adversely affect the Company's financial condition.The Company's operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. These laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. The Company must conform its operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which the Company's divisions operate as these requirements change.The Company uses and generates hazardous substances and wastes in its operations and, as a result, could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury. The Company has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations. In connection with the Company's acquisitions, the Company may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which it may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require the Company to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.8Our technology is important to the Company's success and the failure to protect this technology could put the Company at a competitive disadvantage.Some of the Company's products rely on proprietary technology; therefore, the Company believes that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of its business. Despite the Company's efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use the Company's products or technology. Actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and the Company make no assurances that any such actions will be successful.The Company relies on information and technology for many of its business operations, which could fail and cause disruption to the Company's business operations.The Company's business operations are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to securely transmit, process and store electronic information and to communicate among its locations around the world and with clients and vendors. A shut-down of, or inability to access, one or more of the Company's facilities, a power outage or a failure of one or more of the Company's information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair the Company's ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. Computer viruses, cyberattacks, other external hazards and human error could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information, corruption of data or operational disruption. If sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, system failure, service denial or data loss and damage could result in a deterioration of the Company's ability to write and process orders, provide customer service or perform other necessary business functions.A breach in the security of the Company's software could harm its reputation, result in a loss of current and potential customers and subject the Company to material claims, which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition.If the Company's security measures are breached, an unauthorized party may obtain access to the Company's data or users' or customers' data. In addition, cyber-attacks and similar acts could lead to interruptions and delays in customer processing or a loss or breach of a customer's data. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm the Company's business is likely to increase as the Company expands the number of web-based products we offer,  the services we provide, and our global operations.Regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with the Company's data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that the Company change its data practices, which could have an adverse effect on its business and results of operations.Any security breaches for which the Company is, or is perceived to be, responsible, in whole or in part, could subject us to legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations, which could harm the Company's reputation and result in significant litigation costs and damage awards or settlement amounts. Any imposition of liability, particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage, could materially harm our operating results and financial condition. Security breaches also could cause the Company to lose current and potential customers, which could have an adverse effect onour business. Moreover, the Company might be required to expend significant financial and other resources to further protect against security breaches or to rectify problems caused by any security breach.The Company could be subject to litigation, which could have a material impact on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.From time to time, the Company's operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, and environmental and employment matters, which are defended and settled in the ordinary course of business. While the Company is unable to predict the outcome9of any of these matters, it does not believe, based upon currently available information, that the resolution of any pending matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. See ""ITEM 3 – LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"" in this Form 10-K for a discussion of current litigation.The Company could be subject to additional tax liabilities.The Company is subject to income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of other foreign jurisdictions in which the Company has business operations.  These laws are complex and subject to interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment and interpretation is required in determining the Company's worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of business, transactions arise where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although the Company believes that our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Based on the status of a given tax audit or related litigation, a material effect on the Company's income tax provision or net income may result during the period or periods from the initial recognition of a particular matter in the Company's reported financial results to the final closure of that tax audit or settlement of related litigation when the ultimate tax and related cash flow is known with certainty.The Company's goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets may become impaired, which could require a significant charge to earnings to be recognized.Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually. Future operating results used in the assumptions, such as sales or profit forecasts, may not materialize, and the Company could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment is determined, resulting in an unfavorable impact on our results of operations. Numerous assumptions are used in the evaluation of impairment, and there is no guarantee that the Company's independent registered public accounting firm would reach the same conclusion as the Company or an independent valuation firm, which could result in a disagreement between management and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.The Company may need additional capital in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.From time-to-time, the Company has historically relied on outside financing to fund expanded operations, capital expenditure programs and acquisitions. The Company may require additional capital in the future to fund operations or strategic opportunities. The Company cannot be assured that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, the terms of available financing may place limits on the Company's financial and operating flexibility. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient capital in the future, the Company may not be able to expand or acquire complementary businesses and may not be able to continue to develop new products or otherwise respond to changing business conditions or competitive pressures.The Company's stock price may become highly volatile.The Company's stock price may change dramatically when buyers seeking to purchase shares of the Company's common stock exceed the shares available on the market, or when there are no buyers to purchase shares of the Company's common stock when shareholders are trying to sell their shares.The Company may not be able to reach acceptable terms for contracts negotiated with its labor unions and be subject to work stoppages or disruption of production.During 2019, union contracts covering approximately 1% of the Company's total workforce will expire.  The Company has been successful in negotiating new contracts over the years, but cannot guarantee that will continue. Failure to negotiate new union contracts could result in the disruption of production, inability to deliver product or a number of unforeseen circumstances, any of which could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.10Deterioration in the creditworthiness of several major customers could have a material impact on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.Included as a significant asset on the Company's balance sheet are accounts receivable from our customers.  If several large customers become insolvent or are otherwise unable to pay for products, or become unwilling or unable to make payments in a timely manner, it could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.Although the Company is not dependent on any one customer, deterioration in several large customers at the same time could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.  No one customer exceeded 10% of total accounts receivable for 2018 or 2017.The Company's operating results may fluctuate, which makes the results of operations difficult to predict and could cause the results to fall short of expectations.The Company's operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control.  As a result, comparing the Company's operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and past results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.  Quarterly, year to date and annual costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues may differ significantly from historical or projected levels.  Future operating results may fall below expectations.  These types of events could cause the price of the Company's stock to fall.New or existing U.S. or foreign laws could subject the Company to claims or otherwise impact the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.The Company is subject to a variety of laws in both the U.S. and foreign countries that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and can subject the Company to claims or other remedies"
1,EML,EASTERN CO,2018-03-15,"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORSIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K and the exhibits hereto and the Company's other filings with the SEC, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company's business. The Company's business, financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks or additional risks not presently known to the Company, or by risks the Company currently deems immaterial. which may also adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations, such as: changes in the economy, including changes in inflation, tax rates, interest rates and currency exchange rates; risk associated with possible disruption in the Company's operations due to terrorism, cybersecurity threats and other manmade or natural disasters; future regulatory actions, legal issues or environmental matters; loss of, or changes in, executive management; and changes in accounting standards that are adverse to the Company.  Additionally, there can be no assurance that the Company has correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting its business or that information publicly available with respect to these matters is complete and correct.The Company's business is subject to risks associated with conducting business overseas.International operations could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection measures, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, differing intellectual property rights and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs. Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies could result in increases or decreases in earnings and may adversely affect the value of the Company's assets outside the United States. The Company's operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations. These trade agreements could impose requirements that adversely affect the Company's business, such as, but not limited to, setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into the Company's key markets in North America.The Company's ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the United States or other countries. These issues could delay importation of products or require the Company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on the Company's business, financial conditions or results of operations.Indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.As of December, 31, 2017, the Company had $35,225,000 in total consolidated indebtedness. Subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility, the Company may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions. The level of indebtedness and servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operation and business strategy. For example, the indebtedness could:·Place the Company at a competitive disadvantage relative to the Company's competitors, some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources;·Limit our ability to borrow additional funds;7·Limit our ability to complete future acquisitions;·Limit our ability to pay dividends;·Limit our ability to make capital expenditures; and·Increase the Company's vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.The Company's ability to make scheduled principal payments, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy other debt obligations will depend upon future operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond the Company's control. In addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or the issuance of equity would be available to the Company on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of the Company's debt. If the Company is unable to service its indebtedness, the business, financial condition and results of operation would be materially adversely affected.The Company's credit facility contains covenants requiring the Company to achieve certain financial and operations results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. The Company's ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in its credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and the Company may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or the Company's inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in our credit facility could result in an event of default under such credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility and/or the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our credit facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, the Company's assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under our credit facility or the Company's other indebtedness.  See also ""ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK"" of this Form 10-K.In addition, the Company's growth strategy involves expanding sales of its products into foreign markets. There is no guarantee that the Company's products will be accepted by foreign customers or how long it may take to develop sales of the Company's products in these foreign markets.Increases in the price or reduced availability of raw materials.Raw materials needed to manufacture products are obtained from numerous suppliers. Under normal market conditions, these raw materials are readily available on the open market from a variety of producers. However, from time to time, the prices and availability of these raw materials fluctuate, which could impair the Company's ability to procure the required raw materials for its operations or increase the cost of manufacturing its products. If the price of raw materials increases, the Company may be unable to pass these increases on to its customers and could experience reductions to its profit margins. Also, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair the Company's ability to meet production requirements in a timely manner.If tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, such as those recently proposed by the President of the United States, are implemented, our cost of raw materials may increase, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The Company obtains raw materials, including stainless steel used in the production of its products from domestic, Asian affiliated and nonaffiliated sources.  The President of the United States recently announced a proposal to impose tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on imported aluminum through the issuance of an executive order.  If implemented, such tariffs may cause an increase in costs for all domestic entities, including the Company, that purchase imported steel or aluminum.   Because steel are raw materials used in a wide-range of the Company's products, a broad-based cost increase would result in an increase in the Company's cost of goods sold, which may require us to increase prices for some of our products.  However, our inability to pass along such price increases to our customers, or an inability of our suppliers to meet our raw material requirements, may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.Changes in competition in the markets that the Company services could impact revenues and earnings.Any change in competition may result in lost market share or reduced prices, which could result in reduced profits and margins. This may impair the ability to grow or even maintain current levels of revenues and earnings.  While the Company has an extensive customer base, loss of certain customers could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations until such business is replaced, and no assurances can be made that the Company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers.8The Company is required to evaluate its internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.The Company is an ""accelerated filer"" as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act and is thus required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 requires the Company to include in its report management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal period for which the Company is filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K. This report must also include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that the Company has identified. Additionally, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is required to issue a report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting and their evaluation of the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Company's assessment requires it to make subjective judgments, and the independent registered public accounting firm may not agree with the Company's assessment. If the Company or its independent registered public accounting firm were unable to complete the assessments within the period prescribed by Section 404 and thus be unable to conclude that the internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in the Company's reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Company's common stock or impact the Company's borrowing ability. In addition, changes in operating conditions and changes in compliance with policies and procedures currently in place may result in inadequate internal control over financial reporting in the future.The inability to develop new products could limit growth.Demand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new competitive products at favorable profit margins could adversely affect the Company's performance and prospects for future growth, and the Company would not be positioned to maintain current levels of revenues and earnings. The uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products, such as the market demands and the costs of development and production, may impede the successful development and introduction of new products. Acceptance of the new products may not meet sales expectations due to several factors, such as the Company's potential inability to accurately predict market demand or to resolve technical issues in a timely and cost effective manner. Additionally, the inability to develop new products on a timely basis could result in the loss of business to competitors.The inability to identify or complete acquisitions could limit growth.The Company's future growth may partly depend on its ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses. The Company intends to seek additional acquisition opportunities, both to expend into new markets and to enhance the Company's position in existing markets. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate terms, obtain financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets. Once acquired, operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability.Acquisitions involve risk, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. Although the Company's management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there can be no assurances that the Company's management will properly ascertain all such risks. In addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial debt and other expenses. Future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. Difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase the Company's expenses and adversely affect the Company's financial condition.The Company's operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. These laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. The Company must conform its operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which the Company's divisions operate as these requirements change.9The Company uses and generates hazardous substances and wastes in its operations and, as a result, could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury. The Company has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations. In connection with the Company's acquisitions, the Company may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which it may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require the Company to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our technology is important to the Company's success and the failure to protect this technology could put the Company at a competitive disadvantage.Some of the Company's products rely on proprietary technology; therefore, the Company believes that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of its business. Despite the Company's efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use the Company's products or technology. Actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and the Company make no assurances that any such actions will be successful.The Company relies on information and technology for many of its business operations, which could fail and cause disruption to the Company's business operations.The Company's business operations are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to securely transmit, process and store electronic information and to communicate among its locations around the world and with clients and vendors. A shut-down of, or inability to access, one or more of the Company's facilities, a power outage or a failure of one or more of the Company's information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair the Company's ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. Computer viruses, cyberattacks, other external hazards and human error could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information, corruption of data or operational disruption. If sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, system failure, service denial or data loss and damage could result in a deterioration of the Company's ability to write and process orders, provide customer service or perform other necessary business functions.A breach in the security of the Company's software could harm its reputation, result in a loss of current and potential customers and subject the Company to material claims, which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition.If the Company's security measures are breached, an unauthorized party may obtain access to the Company's data or users' or customers' data. In addition, cyber-attacks and similar acts could lead to interruptions and delays in customer processing or a loss or breach of a customer's data. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm the Company's business is likely to increase as the Company expands the number of web-based products we offer,  the services we provide, and our global operations.Regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with the Company's data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that the Company change its data practices, which could have an adverse effect on its business and results of operations.Any security breaches for which the Company is, or is perceived to be, responsible, in whole or in part, could subject us to legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations, which could harm the Company's reputation and result in significant litigation costs and damage awards or settlement amounts. Any imposition of liability, particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage, could materially harm our operating results and financial condition. Security breaches also could cause the Company to lose current and potential customers, which could have an adverse effect on10our business. Moreover, the Company might be required to expend significant financial and other resources to further protect against security breaches or to rectify problems caused by any security breach.The Company could be subject to litigation, which could have a material impact on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.From time to time, the Company's operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, and environmental and employment matters, which are defended and settled in the ordinary course of business. While the Company is unable to predict the outcome of any of these matters, it does not believe, based upon currently available information, that the resolution of any pending matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. See ""ITEM 3 – LEGAL PROCEEDINGS"" in this Form 10-K for a discussion of current litigation.The Company could be subject to additional tax liabilities.The Company is subject to income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of other foreign jurisdictions in which the Company has business operations.  These laws are complex and subject to interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment and interpretation is required in determining the Company's worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of business, transactions arise where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although the Company believes that our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Based on the status of a given tax audit or related litigation, a material effect on the Company's income tax provision or net income may result during the period or periods from the initial recognition of a particular matter in the Company's reported financial results to the final closure of that tax audit or settlement of related litigation when the ultimate tax and related cash flow is known with certainty.The Company's goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets may become impaired, which could require a significant charge to earnings to be recognized.Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually. Future operating results used in the assumptions, such as sales or profit forecasts, may not materialize, and the Company could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment is determined, resulting in an unfavorable impact on our results of operations. Numerous assumptions are used in the evaluation of impairment, and there is no guarantee that the Company's independent registered public accounting firm would reach the same conclusion as the Company or an independent valuation firm, which could result in a disagreement between management and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.The Company may need additional capital in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.From time-to-time, the Company has historically relied on outside financing to fund expanded operations, capital expenditure programs and acquisitions. The Company may require additional capital in the future to fund operations or strategic opportunities. The Company cannot be assured that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, the terms of available financing may place limits on the Company's financial and operating flexibility. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient capital in the future, the Company may not be able to expand or acquire complementary businesses and may not be able to continue to develop new products or otherwise respond to changing business conditions or competitive pressures.The Company's stock price may become highly volatile.The Company's stock price may change dramatically when buyers seeking to purchase shares of the Company's common stock exceed the shares available on the market, or when there are no buyers to purchase shares of the Company's common stock when shareholders are trying to sell their shares.11The Company may not be able to reach acceptable terms for contracts negotiated with its labor unions and be subject to work stoppages or disruption of production.During 2018, union contracts covering approximately 9% of the Company's total workforce will expire.  The Company has been successful in negotiating new contracts over the years, but cannot guarantee that will continue. Failure to negotiate new union contracts could result in the disruption of production, inability to deliver product or a number of unforeseen circumstances, any of which could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.Deterioration in the creditworthiness of several major customers could have a material impact on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.Included as a significant asset on the Company's balance sheet are accounts receivable from our customers.  If several large customers become insolvent or are otherwise unable to pay for products, or become unwilling or unable to make payments in a timely manner, it could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.Although the Company is not dependent on any one customer, deterioration in several large customers at the same time could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.  No one customer exceeded 10% of total accounts receivable for 2017, 2016 or 2015.The Company's operating results may fluctuate, which makes the results of operations difficult to predict and could cause the results to fall short of expectations.The Company's operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control.  As a result, comparing the Company's operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and past results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.  Quarterly, year to date and annual costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues may differ significantly from historical or projected levels.  Future operating results may fall below expectations.  These types of events could cause the price of the Company's stock to fall.New or existing U.S. or foreign laws could subject the Company to claims or otherwise impact the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.The Company is subject to a variety of laws in both the U.S. and foreign countries that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and can subject the Company to claims or other remedies"
5,EML,EASTERN CO,2017-03-15,"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORSIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K and the exhibits hereto and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company’s business. The Company’s business, financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks or additional risks not presently known to the Company, or by risks the Company currently deems immaterial which may also adversely affect its business, financial condition, or results of operations, such as: changes in the economy, including changes in inflation, tax rates interest rates and currency exchange rates; risk associated with possible disruption in the Company’s operations due to terrorism and other manmade or natural disasters; future regulatory actions, legal issues or environmental matters; loss of, or changes in, executive management; and changes in accounting standards which are adverse to the Company.  Also, there can be no assurance that the Company has correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting its business or that information publicly available with respect to these matters is complete and correct.The Company’s business is subject to risks associated with conducting business overseas.International operations could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection measures, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, differing intellectual property rights, and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs. Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could result in increases or decreases in earnings, and may adversely affect the value of the Company’s assets outside the United States. The Company’s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations. Although generally these trade agreements have positive effects, they can also impose requirements that adversely affect the Company’s business, such as setting quotas on product that may be imported from a particular country into the Company’s key markets in North America.The Company’s ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the United States or other countries. These issues could delay importation of products or require the Company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial conditions or results of operations.See also “ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK” of this Form 10-K.In addition, the Company’s growth strategy involves expanding sales of its products into foreign markets. There is no guarantee that the Company’s products will be accepted by foreign customers or how long it may take to develop sales of the Company’s products in these foreign markets.Increases in the price or reduced availability of raw materials.Raw materials needed to manufacture products are obtained from numerous suppliers. Under normal market conditions, these raw materials are readily available on the open market from a variety of producers. However, from time to time the prices and availability of these raw materials fluctuate, which could impair the Company’s ability to procure the required raw materials for its operations or increase the cost of manufacturing its products. If the price of raw materials increases, the Company may be unable to pass these increases on to its customers and could experience reduction to its profit margins. Also, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair the Company’s ability to meet production requirements in a timely manner.Increased competition in the markets the Company services could impact revenues and earnings.Any change in competition may result in lost market share or reduced prices, which could result in reduced profit margins. This may impair the ability to grow or even maintain current levels of revenues and earnings.  While the Company has an extensive -6-      customer base, loss of certain customers could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations until such business is replaced, and no assurances can be made that the Company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers.The Company is required to evaluate its internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.The Company is an “accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 requires the Company to include in its report management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal period for which the Company is filing its Form 10-K. This report must also include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that the Company has identified. Additionally, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm is required to issue a report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and their evaluation of the operating effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s assessment requires it to make subjective judgments, and the independent registered public accounting firm may not agree with the Company’s assessment. If the Company or its independent registered public accounting firm were unable to complete the assessments within the period prescribed by Section 404 and thus be unable to conclude that the internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in the Company’s reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Company’s common stock or impact the Company’s borrowing ability. In addition, changes in operating conditions and changes in compliance with policies and procedures currently in place may result in inadequate internal control over financial reporting in the future.The inability to identify or complete acquisitions could limit future growth.As part of its growth strategy, the Company continues to pursue acquisitions of complementary products or businesses. The ability to grow through acquisitions depends upon the Company’s ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisitions. The Company makes certain assumptions based on the information provided by potential acquisition candidates and also conducts due diligence to ensure the information provided is accurate and based on reasonable assumptions. However, the Company may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or predict accurately how an acquisition will ultimately affect the business, financial condition or results of operations.Demand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new competitive products at favorable profit margins could adversely affect the Company’s performance and prospects for future growth, and the Company would not be positioned to maintain current levels of revenues and earnings.The uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products, such as the market demands and the costs of development and production, may impede the successful development and introduction of new products. Acceptance of the new products may not meet sales expectations due to several factors, such as the Company’s failure to accurately predict market demand or its inability to resolve technical issues in a timely and cost-effective manner. Additionally, the inability to develop new products on a timely basis could result in the loss of business to competitors.The Company could be subject to litigation which could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.From time to time, the Company’s operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental and employment matters, which are defended and settled in the ordinary course of business. While the Company is unable to predict the outcome of any of these matters, it does not believe, based upon currently available information, that the resolution of any pending matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.

Failure to negotiate new union contracts could result in disruption of production, inability to deliver product or a number of unforeseen circumstances, any of which could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial statements.Deterioration in the creditworthiness of several major customers could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Included as a significant asset on the Company’s balance sheet are accounts receivable from our customers.  If several large customers become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay for products, or become unwilling or unable to make payments in a timely manner, it could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial statements.Although the Company is not dependent on any one customer, deterioration in several large customers at the same time could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial statements.  No customers exceeded 10% of total accounts receivable for 2015, 2014 or 2013. 8      The Company’s operating results may fluctuate, which makes the results of operations difficult to predict and could cause the results to fall short of expectations.The Company’s operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control.  As a result, comparing the Company’s operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and past results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.  Quarterly, year to date and annual costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue may differ significantly from historical or projected rates.  Future operating results may fall below expectations.  These types of events could cause the price of the Company’s stock to fall.New or existing U.S. or foreign laws could subject the Company to claims or otherwise impact the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.The Company is subject to a variety of laws in both the U.S. and foreign countries that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort, and can subject the Company to claims or other remedies"
3,EML,EASTERN CO,2015-03-13,"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORSIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K and the exhibits hereto and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company’s business. The Company’s business, financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks or additional risks not presently known to the Company, or by risks the Company currently deems immaterial which may also adversely affect its business, financial condition, or results of operations, such as: changes in the economy, including changes in inflation, tax rates and interest rates; risk associated with possible disruption in the Company’s operations due to terrorism and other manmade or natural disasters; future regulatory actions, legal issues or environmental matters; loss of, or changes in, executive management; and changes in accounting standards which are adverse to the Company.  Also, there can be no assurance that the Company has correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting its business or that information publicly available with respect to these matters is complete and correct.The Company’s business is subject to risks associated with conducting business overseas.International operations could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection measures, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, differing intellectual property rights, and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs. Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could result in increases or decreases in earnings, and may adversely affect the value of the Company’s assets outside the United States. The Company’s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations. Although generally these trade agreements have positive effects, they can also impose requirements that adversely affect the Company’s business, such as setting quotas on product that may be imported from a particular country into the Company’s key markets in North America.The Company’s ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the United States or other countries. These issues could delay importation of products or require the Company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial conditions or results of operations.See also “ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK” of this Form 10-K.In addition, the Company’s growth strategy involves expanding sales of its products into foreign markets. There is no guarantee that the Company’s products will be accepted by foreign customers or how long it may take to develop sales of the Company’s products in these foreign markets.Increases in the price or reduced availability of raw materials.Raw materials needed to manufacture products are obtained from numerous suppliers. Under normal market conditions, these raw materials are readily available on the open market from a variety of producers. However, from time to time the prices and availability of these raw materials fluctuate, which could impair the Company’s ability to procure the required raw materials for its operations or increase the cost of manufacturing its products. If the price of raw materials increases, the Company may be unable to pass these increases on to its customers and could experience reduction to its profit margins. Also, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair the Company’s ability to meet production requirements in a timely manner. 7      Increased competition in the markets the Company services could impact revenues and earnings.Any change in competition may result in lost market share or reduced prices, which could result in reduced profit margins. This may impair the ability to grow or even maintain current levels of revenues and earnings.  While the Company has an extensive customer base, loss of certain customers could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations until such business is replaced, and no assurances can be made that the Company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers.The Company is required to evaluate its internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.The Company is an “accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 requires the Company to include in its report management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal period for which the Company is filing its Form 10-K. This report must also include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that the Company has identified. Additionally, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm is required to issue a report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and their evaluation of the operating effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s assessment requires it to make subjective judgments, and the independent registered public accounting firm may not agree with the Company’s assessment. If the Company or its independent registered public accounting firm were unable to complete the assessments within the period prescribed by Section 404 and thus be unable to conclude that the internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in the Company’s reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Company’s common stock or impact the Company’s borrowing ability. In addition, changes in operating conditions and changes in compliance with policies and procedures currently in place may result in inadequate internal control over financial reporting in the future.The inability to identify or complete acquisitions could limit future growth.As part of its growth strategy, the Company continues to pursue acquisitions of complementary products or businesses. The ability to grow through acquisitions depends upon the Company’s ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisitions. The Company makes certain assumptions based on the information provided by potential acquisition candidates and also conducts due diligence to ensure the information provided is accurate and based on reasonable assumptions. However, the Company may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or predict accurately how an acquisition will ultimately affect the business, financial condition or results of operations.Demand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new competitive products at favorable profit margins could adversely affect the Company’s performance and prospects for future growth, and the Company would not be positioned to maintain current levels of revenues and earnings.The uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products, such as the market demands and the costs of development and production, may impede the successful development and introduction of new products. Acceptance of the new products may not meet sales expectations due to several factors, such as the Company’s failure to accurately predict market demand or its inability to resolve technical issues in a timely and cost-effective manner. Additionally, the inability to develop new products on a timely basis could result in the loss of business to competitors.The Company could be subject to litigation which could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.From time to time, the Company’s operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental and employment matters, which are defended and settled in the ordinary course of business. While the Company is unable to predict the outcome of any of these matters, it does not believe, based upon currently available information, that the resolution of any pending matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. See “ITEM 3 – LEGAL PROCEEDINGS” in this Form 10-K for a discussion of current litigation. 8      The Company could be subject to additional tax liabilities.The Company is subject to income tax laws in the United States, its states and municipalities and those of other foreign jurisdictions in which the Company has business operations. These laws are complex and subject to interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment and interpretation is required in determining the Company’s worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of business, transactions arise where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although the Company believes its tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Based on the status of a given tax audit or related litigation, a material effect on the Company’s income tax provision or net income may result during the period or periods from the initial recognition of a particular matter in the Company’s reported financial results to the final closure of that tax audit or settlement of related litigation when the ultimate tax and related cash flow is known with certainty.The Company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets may become impaired, which could require a significant charge to earnings to be recognized.Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually. Future operating results used in the assumptions, such as sales or profit forecasts, may not materialize, and the Company could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment is determined, resulting in an unfavorable impact on our results of operations. Numerous assumptions are used in the evaluation of impairment, and there is no guarantee that the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm would reach the same conclusion as the Company or an independent valuation firm, which could result in a disagreement between management and the independent registered public accounting firm.The Company may need additional capital in the future, and it may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.From time-to-time, the Company has historically relied on outside financing to fund expanded operations, capital expenditure programs and acquisitions. The Company may require additional capital in the future to fund operations or strategic opportunities. The Company cannot be assured that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, the terms of available financing may place limits on the Company’s financial and operating flexibility. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient capital in the future, the Company may not be able to expand or acquire complementary businesses and may not be able to continue to develop new products or otherwise respond to changing business conditions or competitive pressures.The Company’s stock price is highly volatile due to low float, which is the number of shares of the Company’s common stock that are outstanding and available for trading by the public.The Company’s stock price may change dramatically when buyers seeking to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock exceed the shares available on the market, or when there are no buyers to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock when shareholders are trying to sell their shares.The Company may not be able to reach acceptable terms for contracts negotiated with its labor unions and be subject to work stoppages or disruption of production.During 2015, none of the union contracts covering the workforce of the Company will expire.  The Company has been successful in negotiating new contracts over the years, but cannot guarantee that will continue.

These laws are complex and subject to interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment and interpretation is required in determining the Company’s worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of business, transactions arise where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although the Company believes its tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Based on the status of a given tax audit or related litigation, a material effect on the Company’s income tax provision or net income may result during the period or periods from the initial recognition of a particular matter in the Company’s reported financial results to the final closure of that tax audit or settlement of related litigation when the ultimate tax and related cash flow is known with certainty.The Company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets may become impaired, which could require a significant charge to earnings to be recognized.Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually. Future operating results used in the assumptions, such as sales or profit forecasts, may not materialize, and the Company could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment is determined, resulting in an unfavorable impact on our results of operations. Numerous assumptions are used in the evaluation of impairment, and there is no guarantee that the Company’s 8      independent registered public accounting firm would reach the same conclusion as the Company or an independent valuation firm, which could result in a disagreement between management and the independent registered public accounting firm.The Company may need additional capital in the future, and it may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.From time-to-time, the Company has historically relied on outside financing to fund expanded operations, capital expenditure programs and acquisitions. The Company may require additional capital in the future to fund operations or strategic opportunities. The Company cannot be assured that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, the terms of available financing may place limits on the Company’s financial and operating flexibility. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient capital in the future, the Company may not be able to expand or acquire complementary businesses and may not be able to continue to develop new products or otherwise respond to changing business conditions or competitive pressures.The Company’s stock price is highly volatile due to low float, which is the number of shares of the Company’s common stock that are outstanding and available for trading by the public.The Company’s stock price may change dramatically when buyers seeking to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock exceed the shares available on the market, or when there are no buyers to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock when shareholders are trying to sell their shares.The Company may not be able to reach acceptable terms for contracts negotiated with its labor unions and be subject to work stoppages or disruption of production.During 2013, union contracts covering approximately 19% of the total workforce of the Company will expire.  The Company has been successful in negotiating new contracts over the years, but cannot guarantee that will continue. Failure to negotiate new union contracts could result in disruption of production, inability to deliver product or a number of unforeseen circumstances, any of which could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial statements.Deterioration in the creditworthiness of several major customers could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Included as a significant asset on the Company’s balance sheet are accounts receivable from our customers.  If several large customers become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay for products, or become unwilling or unable to make payments in a timely manner, it could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial statements.  Although the Company is not dependent on any one customer, deterioration in several large customers at the same time could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial statements.  No customers exceeded 10% of total accounts receivable for 2012 or 2010.  At the end of 2011 only one customer had an outstanding accounts receivable balance that exceeded 10% of total accounts receivable.The Company’s operating results may fluctuate, which makes the results of operations difficult to predict and could cause the results to fall short of expectations.The Company’s operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control.  As a result, comparing the Company’s operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and past results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.  Quarterly, year to date and annual costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue may differ significantly from historical or projected rates.  Future operating results may fall below expectations.  These types of events could cause the price of the Company’s stock to fall.New or existing U.S. or foreign laws could subject the Company to claims or otherwise impact the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.The Company is subject to a variety of laws in both the U.S. and foreign countries that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort, and can subject the Company to claims or other remedies. 9       "
15,EML,EASTERN CO,2012-03-12,"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORSIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K and the exhibits hereto and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company’s business. The Company’s business, financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks or additional risks not presently known to the Company, or by risks the Company currently deems immaterial which may also adversely affect its business, financial condition, or results of operations, such as: changes in the economy, including changes in inflation, tax rates and interest rates; risk associated with possible disruption in the Company’s operations due to terrorism and other 6      manmade or natural disasters; future regulatory actions, legal issues or environmental matters; loss of, or changes in, executive management; and changes in accounting standards which are adverse to the Company.  Also, there can be no assurance that the Company has correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting its business or that information publicly available with respect to these matters is complete and correct.The Company’s business is subject to risks associated with conducting business overseas.International operations could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection measures, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, differing intellectual property rights, and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs. Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could result in increases or decreases in earnings, and may adversely affect the value of the Company’s assets outside the United States. The Company’s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations. Although generally these trade agreements have positive effects, they can also impose requirements that adversely affect the Company’s business, such as setting quotas on product that may be imported from a particular country into the Company’s key markets in North America.The Company’s ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the United States or other countries. These issues could delay importation of products or require the Company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial conditions or results of operations.See also “ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK” of this Form 10-K.In addition, the Company’s growth strategy involves expanding sales of its products into foreign markets. There is no guarantee that the Company’s products will be accepted by foreign customers or how long it may take to develop sales of the Company’s products in these foreign markets.Increases in the price or reduced availability of raw materials.Raw materials needed to manufacture products are obtained from numerous suppliers. Under normal market conditions, these raw materials are readily available on the open market from a variety of producers. However, from time to time the prices and availability of these raw materials fluctuate, which could impair the Company’s ability to procure the required raw materials for its operations or increase the cost of manufacturing its products. If the price of raw materials increases, the Company may be unable to pass these increases on to its customers and could experience reduction to its profit margins. Also, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair the Company’s ability to meet production requirements in a timely manner.Increased competition in the markets the Company services could impact revenues and earnings.Any change in competition may result in lost market share or reduced prices, which could result in reduced profit margins. This may impair the ability to grow or even maintain current levels of revenues and earnings.  While the Company has an extensive customer base, loss of certain customers could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations until such business is replaced, and no assurances can be made that the Company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers.The Company is required to evaluate its internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.The Company is an “accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 requires the Company to include in its report management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal period for which the Company is filing its Form 10-K. This report must also include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that the Company has identified. Additionally, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm is required to issue a report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and their evaluation of the operating effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The 7      Company’s assessment requires it to make subjective judgments, and the independent registered public accounting firm may not agree with the Company’s assessment. If the Company or its independent registered public accounting firm were unable to complete the assessments within the period prescribed by Section 404 and thus be unable to conclude that the internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in the Company’s reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Company’s common stock or impact the Company’s borrowing ability. In addition, changes in operating conditions and changes in compliance with policies and procedures currently in place may result in inadequate internal control over financial reporting in the future.The inability to identify or complete acquisitions could limit future growth.As part of its growth strategy, the Company continues to pursue acquisitions of complementary products or businesses. The ability to grow through acquisitions depends upon the Company’s ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisitions. The Company makes certain assumptions based on the information provided by potential acquisition candidates and also conducts due diligence to ensure the information provided is accurate and based on reasonable assumptions. However, the Company may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or predict accurately how an acquisition will ultimately affect the business, financial condition or results of operations.Demand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new competitive products at favorable profit margins could adversely affect the Company’s performance and prospects for future growth, and the Company would not be positioned to maintain current levels of revenues and earnings.The uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products, such as the market demands and the costs of development and production, may impede the successful development and introduction of new products. Acceptance of the new products may not meet sales expectations due to several factors, such as the Company’s failure to accurately predict market demand or its inability to resolve technical issues in a timely and cost-effective manner. Additionally, the inability to develop new products on a timely basis could result in the loss of business to competitors.The Company could be subject to litigation which could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.From time to time, the Company’s operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental and employment matters, which are defended and settled in the ordinary course of business. While the Company is unable to predict the outcome of any of these matters, it does not believe, based upon currently available information, that the resolution of any pending matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. See “ITEM 3 – LEGAL PROCEEDINGS” in this Form 10-K for a discussion of current litigation.The Company could be subject to additional tax liabilities.The Company is subject to income tax laws in the United States, its states and municipalities and those of other foreign jurisdictions in which the Company has business operations.

If the Company or its independent registered public accounting firm were unable to complete the assessments within the period prescribed by Section 404 and thus be unable to conclude that the internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in the Companys reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on themarket price of the Companys common stock or impact the Companys borrowing ability. In addition, changes in operating conditions and changes in compliance with policies and procedures currently in place may result in inadequate internal control over financial reporting in the future. The inability to identify or complete acquisitions could limit future growth. As part of its growth strategy, the Company continues to pursue acquisitions of complementary products or businesses. The ability to grow through acquisitions depends upon the Companys ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisitions. The Company makes certain assumptions based on the information provided by potential acquisition candidates and also conducts due diligence to ensure the information provided is accurate and based on reasonable assumptions. However, the Company may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or predict accurately how an acquisition will ultimately affect the business, financial condition or results of operations.  Demand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new competitive products at favorable profit margins could adversely affect the Companys performance and prospects for future growth, and the Company would not be positioned to maintain current levels of revenues and earnings. The uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products, such as the market demands and the costs of development and production, may impede the successful development and introduction of new products. Acceptance of the new products may not meet sales expectations due to several factors, such as the Companys failure to accurately predict market demand or its inability to resolve technical issues in a timely and cost-effective manner. Additionally, the inability to develop new products on a timely basis could result in the loss of business to competitors. The Company could be subject to litigation which could have a material impact on the Companys business, financial condition or results of operations.             From time to time, the Companys operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental and employment matters, which are defended and settled in the ordinary course of business. While the Company is unable to predict the outcome of any of these matters, it does not believe, based upon currently available information, that the resolution of any pending matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. See ITEM 3  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS in this Form 10-K for a discussion of current litigation. The Company could be subject to additional tax liabilities. The Company is subject to income tax laws in the United States, its states and municipalities and those of other foreign jurisdictions in which the Company has business operations. These laws are complex and subject to interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment and interpretation is required in determining the Companys worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of business, transactions arise where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although the Company believes its tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Based on the status of a given tax audit or related litigation, a material effect on the Companys income tax provision or net income may result duringthe period or periods from the initial recognition of a particular matter in the Companys reported financial results to the final closure of that tax audit or settlement of related litigation when the ultimate tax and related cash flow is known with certainty.  8 The Companys goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets may become impaired, which could require a significant charge to earnings to be recognized. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually. Future operating results used in the assumptions, such as sales or profit forecasts, may not materialize, and the Company could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment is determined, resulting in an unfavorable impact on our results of operations. Numerous assumptions are used in the evaluation of impairment, and there is no guarantee that the Companys independent registered public accounting firm would reach the same conclusion as the Company or an independent valuation firm, which could result in a disagreement between management and the independent registered public accounting firm. The Company may need additional capital in the future, and it may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. From time-to-time, the Company has historically relied on outside financing to fund expanded operations, capital expenditure programs and acquisitions. The Company may require additional capital in the future to fund operations or strategic opportunities. The Company cannot be assured that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, the terms of available financing may place limits on the Companys financial and operating flexibility. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient capital in the future, the Company may not be able to expand or acquire complementary businesses and may not be able to continue to develop new products or otherwise respond to changing business conditions or competitive pressures. The Companys stock price is highly volatile due to low float, which is the number of shares of the Companys common stock that are outstanding and available for trading by the public. The Companys stock price may change dramatically when buyers seeking to purchase shares of the Companys common stock exceed the shares available on the market, or when there are no buyers to purchase shares of the Companys common stock when shareholders are trying to sell their shares. The Company may not be able to reach acceptable terms for contracts negotiated with its labor unions and be subject to work stoppages or disruption of production. During 2010, union contracts covering approximately 18% of the total workforce of the Company will expire.  The Company has been successful in negotiating new contracts over the years, but cannot guarantee that will continue. Failure to negotiate new union contracts could result in disruption of production, inability to deliver product or a number of unforeseen circumstances, any of which could have an unfavorable material impact on the Companys results of operations or financial statements. Deterioration in the creditworthiness of several major customers could have a material impact on the Companys business, financial condition or results of operations.  Included as a significant asset on the Companys balance sheet is accounts receivable from our customers.  If several large customers become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay for products, or become unwilling or unable to make payments in a timely manner, it could have an unfavorable material impact on the Companys results of operations or financial statements.  Although the Company is not dependent on any one customer, and the Company does not have any customers exceeding 10% of total accounts receivable, deterioration in several large customers at the same time could have an unfavorable material impact on the Companys results of operations or financial statements. The Companys operating results may fluctuate, which makes the results of operations difficult to predict and could cause the results to fall short of expectations. The Companys operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control.  As a result, comparing the Companys operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and past results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.  Quarterly, year to date and annual costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue may differ significantly from historical or projected rates.  Future operating results may fall below expectations.  These types of events could cause the price of the Companys stock to fall. 9  New or existing U.S. or foreign laws could subject the Company to claims or otherwise impact the Companys business, financial condition or results of operations. The Company is subject to a variety of laws in both the U.S. and foreign countries that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort, and can subject the Company to claims or other remedies.   "
10,EML,EASTERN CO,2009-03-11,"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORS  In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K and the exhibits hereto and the Companys other filings with the SEC, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Companys business. The Companys business, financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks or additional risks not presently known to the Company, or by risks the Company currently deems immaterial which may also adversely affect its business, financial condition, or results of operations, such as: changes in the economy, including changes in inflation, tax rates and interest rates; risk associated with possible disruption in the Companys operations due to terrorism and other manmade or natural disasters; future regulatory actions, legal issues or environmental matters; loss of, or changes in, executive management; andchanges in accounting standards which are adverse to the Company.  Also, there can be no assurance that the Company has correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting its business or that information publicly available with respect to these matters is complete and correct.  The Companys business is subject to risks associated with conducting business overseas. International operations could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection measures, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, differing intellectual property rights, and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs. Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could result in increases or decreases in earnings, and may adversely affect the value of the Companys assets outside the United States. The Companys operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations. Although generally these trade agreements have positive effects, they can also impose requirements that adversely affect the Companys business, such as setting quotas on product that may be imported from a particular country into the Companys key markets in North America.  The Companys ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the United States or other countries. These issues could delay importation of products or require the Company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on the Companys business, financial conditions or results of operations.  7 See also ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK of this Form 10-K. In addition, the Companys growth strategy involves expanding sales of its products into foreign markets. There is no guarantee that the Companys products will be accepted by foreign customers or how long it may take to develop sales of the Companys products in these foreign markets. Increases in the price or reduced availability of raw materials. Raw materials needed to manufacture products are obtained from numerous suppliers. Under normal market conditions, these raw materials are readily available on the open market from a variety of producers. However, from time to time the prices and availability of these raw materials fluctuate, which could impair the Companys ability to procure the required raw materials for its operations or increase the cost of manufacturing its products. If the price of raw materials increases, the Company may be unable to pass these increases on to its customers and could experience reduction to its profit margins. Also, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair the Companys ability to meet production requirements in a timely manner. Increased competition in the markets the Company services could impact revenues and earnings. Any change in competition may result in lost market share or reduced prices, which could result in reduced profit margins. This may impair the ability to grow or even maintain current levels of revenues and earnings.  While the Company has an extensive customer base, loss of certain customers could adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition or results of operations until such business is replaced, and no assurances can be made that the Company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers. The Company is required to evaluate its internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Company is an accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 requires the Company to include in its report managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal period for which the Company is filing its 10-K. This report must also include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that the Company has identified. Additionally, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm is required to issue a report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting and their evaluation of the operating effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. The Companys assessmentrequires it to make subjective judgments, and the independent registered public accounting firm may not agree with the Companys assessment.

Also, anydecrease in the  availability  of raw materials could impair our ability to meetproduction requirements in a timely manner.INCREASED COMPETITION IN THE MARKETS THE COMPANY SERVICES COULD IMPACT REVENUESAND EARNINGS.Any change in  competition  may result in lost market  share or reduced  prices,which could  result in reduced  profit  margins.  This may impair the ability togrow or even maintain current levels of revenues and earnings. While the Companyhas an extensive customer base, loss of certain customers could adversely affectthe Company's business,  financial condition or results of operations until suchbusiness is replaced,  and no  assurances  can be made that the Company would beable to regain or replace any lost customers.THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO EVALUATE ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIALREPORTING UNDER SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002.As of December 31, 2006, the Company is a ""non-accelerated  filer"" as defined inRule 12b-2 under the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Pursuant tocurrent  reporting  requirements,  the  Company  expects  to be an  ""acceleratedfiler"",  as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, asamended,  and will be required to comply with Section 404 of the  Sarbanes-OxleyAct of 2002  beginning  with our Annual  Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year end2007. Section 404 will require the Company to include in its report management'sassessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financialreporting as of the end of the fiscal period for which the Company is filing its10-K.  This report must also include  disclosure  of any material  weaknesses ininternal  control  over  financial  reporting  that the Company has  identified.Additionally,  the Company's independent  registered public accounting firm willbe required to issue an  attestation  report on  management's  assessment of itsinternal control over financial  reporting and their evaluation of the operatingeffectiveness of the Company's  internal control over financial  reporting.  TheCompany's   assessment  requires  it  to  make  subjective   judgments  and  theindependent  registered  public accounting firm may not agree with the Company'sassessment.  If the Company or its independent registered public accounting firmwere unable to complete the assessments  within the period prescribed by Section404 and thus be unable to conclude  that the  internal  control  over  financialreporting  is  effective,  investors  could  lose  confidence  in  our  reportedfinancial information, which could have an adverse effect on the market price ofthe Company's common stock or impact the Company's borrowing ability.THE INABILITY TO IDENTIFY OR COMPLETE ACQUISITIONS COULD LIMIT FUTURE GROWTH.As part of its growth strategy,  the Company continues to pursue acquisitions ofcomplementary  products or businesses.  The ability to grow through acquisitionsdepends  upon  the  Company's  ability  to  identify,  negotiate,  complete  andintegrate suitable acquisitions.  The Company makes certain assumptions based onthe information provided by potential  acquisition  candidates and also conductsdue  diligence  to ensure the  information  provided  is  accurate  and based onreasonable assumptions, but the Company may be unable to realize the anticipatedbenefits from an  acquisition  or predict  accurately  how an  acquisition  willultimately affect the business, financial condition or results of operations.DEMAND  FOR  NEW  PRODUCTS  AND THE  INABILITY  TO  DEVELOP  AND  INTRODUCE  NEWCOMPETITIVE  PRODUCTS AT FAVORABLE  PROFIT  MARGINS COULD  ADVERSELY  AFFECT THECOMPANY'S  PERFORMANCE AND PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE GROWTH AND THE COMPANY WOULD NOTBE POSITIONED TO MAINTAIN CURRENT LEVELS OF REVENUES AND EARNINGS.The uncertainties  associated with developing and introducing new products, suchas the market demands and the costs of development  and  production,  may impedethe  successful  development  and  introduction  of new  products  successfully.Acceptance  of the new products may not meet sales  expectations  due to severalfactors,  such as the Company's  failure to accurately  predict market demand orits inability to resolve technical issues in a timely and cost-effective manner.Additionally,  the  inability  to develop new  products on a timely  basis couldresult in the loss of business to  competitors.                                      -8-THE COMPANY COULD BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ONTHE COMPANY'S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.From time to time,  the  Company's  operations  are  parties  to or  targets  oflawsuits, claims,  investigations and proceedings,  including product liability,personal  injury,  patent  and  intellectual  property,  commercial,   contract,environmental  and  employment  matters,  which are  defended and settled in theordinary course of business.  While the Company is unable to predict the outcomeof any of these matters,  it does not believe,  based upon  currently  availableinformation,  that the  resolution  of any  pending  matter will have a materialadverse  effect on its business,  financial  condition or results of operations.See ""ITEM 3 - LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS""  in this Form 10-K for a discussion of currentlitigation.THE COMPANY COULD BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL TAX LIABILITIES.The Company is subject to income tax laws in the United  States,  its states andmunicipalities and those of other foreign jurisdictions in which the Company hasbusiness  operations.  These laws are complex and subject to  interpretations bythe taxpayer  and the  relevant  governmental  taxing  authorities.  Significantjudgment and  interpretation is required in determining the Company's  worldwideprovision for income  taxes.  In the ordinary  course of business,  transactionsarise where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe theCompany's tax estimates are reasonable,  the final outcome of tax audits and anyrelated litigation could be materially different from that which is reflected inhistorical  income tax provisions  and accruals.  Based on the status of a giventax audit or related  litigation,  a material effect on our income tax provisionor net  income  may  result  during  the  period  or  periods  from the  initialrecognition  of a  particular  matter in our reported  financial  results to thefinal  closure of that tax audit or settlement  of related  litigation  when theultimate tax and related cash flow is known with certainty.THE COMPANY'S GOODWILL OR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS MAY BECOME IMPAIREDWHICH COULD REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE TO EARNINGS TO BE RECOGNIZED.Under accounting  principles  generally accepted in the United States,  goodwilland  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets are not amortized but are reviewed forimpairment at least annually. Numerous assumptions are used in the evaluation ofimpairment and there is no guarantee that the Company's  independent  registeredpublic  accounting  firm would  reach the same  conclusion  as the Company or anindependent  valuation  firm,  which  could  result  in a  disagreement  betweenmanagement  and  the  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm.  Futureoperating  results used in the assumptions,  such as sales or profit  forecasts,may not  materialize  and the Company  could be required to record a significantcharge to earnings in the  financial  statements  during the period in which anyimpairment is determined,  resulting in an unfavorable  impact on our results ofoperations.THE COMPANY MAY NEED ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE, AND IT MAY NOT BEAVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL.From time-to-time,  the Company has historically  relied on outside financing tofund expanded  operations,  capital expenditure  programs and acquisitions.  TheCompany  may  require  additional  capital in the future to fund  operations  orstrategic opportunities. The Company cannot be assured that additional financingwill be  available  on favorable  terms,  or at all. In  addition,  the terms ofavailable  financing may place limits on the  Company's  financial and operatingflexibility.  If the  Company  is  unable to obtain  sufficient  capital  in thefuture,  the  Company  may  not be  able  to  expand  or  acquire  complementarybusinesses  and may not be able to continue to develop new products or otherwiserespond to changing business conditions or competitive pressures.THE  COMPANY'S  STOCK PRICE IS HIGHLY  VOLATILE  DUE TO LOW FLOAT,  WHICH IS THENUMBER  OF  SHARES  OF THE  COMPANY'S  COMMON  STOCK  THAT ARE  OUTSTANDING  ANDAVAILABLE FOR TRADING BY THE PUBLIC.The  Company's  stock  price may  change  dramatically  when  buyers  seeking topurchase shares of the Company's common stock exceed the shares available on themarket or when there are no buyers to purchase  shares of the  Company's  commonstock when shareholders are trying to sell their shares.                                      -9-THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REACH ACCEPTABLE TERMS FOR CONTRACTS NEGOTIATEDWITH ITS LABOR UNIONS AND BE SUBJECT TO WORK STOPPAGES OR DISRUPTION OFPRODUCTION.During 2007, union contracts covering 32% of the total workforce of the Companywill expire. The Company has been successful in negotiating new contracts overthe years, but cannot guarantee that will continue. Failure to negotiate newunion contracts could result in disruption of production, inability to deliverproduct or a number of unforeseen circumstances, any of which could have anunfavorable material impact on the Company's results of operations or financialstatements"

Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currenciescould result in increases or decreases in earnings and may adversely affectthe value of the Company's assets outside the United States. Our operationsare also subject to the effects of international trade agreements andregulations. Although generally these trade agreements have positive effects,they can also impose requirements that adversely affect our business, such assetting quotas on product that may be imported from a particular country intoour key markets in North America.Our ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may alsobe affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affecttransportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity,labor disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security requirements inthe United States or other countries. These issues could delay importation ofproducts or require us to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers toavoid disruption to our customers. These alternatives may not be available onshort notice or could result in higher transit costs, which could have anadverse impact on our business, financial conditions or results of operations.See also ""ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK""of this Form 10-K.In addition, the Company's growth strategy involves expanding sales of itsproducts into foreign markets.
