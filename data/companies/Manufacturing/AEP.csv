11,AEP,AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER CO,2024-02-26,"ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORSGENERAL RISKS OF REGULATED OPERATIONSAEP may not be able to recover the costs of substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP’s business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the construction of additional transmission and renewable generation facilities, modernizing existing infrastructure, installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits as well as other initiatives.  AEP’s public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions.  If these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates charged, affected AEP subsidiaries would not be able to recover the costs associated with their investments.  This would cause financial results to be diminished.Regulated electric revenues and earnings are dependent on federal and state regulation that may limit AEP’s ability to recover costs and other amounts. (Applies to all Registrants)The rates customers pay to AEP regulated utility businesses are subject to approval by the FERC and the respective state utility commissions of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.  In certain instances, AEP’s applicable regulated utility businesses may agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters that are subject to regulatory approval.  AEP cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of any settlements or the actions by the FERC or the respective state commissions in establishing rates.If regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the relevant commissions, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions, which may decrease future earnings.  Additionally, if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.  Similarly, if recovery or other rate relief authorized in the past is overturned or reversed on appeal, future earnings could be negatively impacted.  Any regulatory action or litigation outcome that triggers a reversal of a regulatory asset or deferred cost generally results in an impairment to the balance sheet and a charge to the income statement of the company involved.In addition, regulators have initiated and may initiate additional proceedings to investigate the prudence of costs in the AEP regulated utility businesses and in base rates and examine, among other things, the reasonableness or prudence of operation and maintenance practices, level of expenditures (including storm costs and costs associated with capital projects), allowed rates of return and rate base, proposed resource acquisitions, and previously incurred capital expenditures that the regulated utility businesses seek to place in rates.  The regulators may disallow costs subject to their jurisdiction found not to have been prudently incurred or found not to have been incurred in compliance with applicable tariffs, creating some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs.  Regulatory proceedings relating to rates and other matters typically involve multiple parties seeking to limit or reduce rates.  Traditional base rate proceedings, as opposed to formula rate plans, generally have long timelines, are primarily based on historical costs, and may or may not be limited in scope or duration by statute.  The length of these base rate proceedings can cause the regulated utility businesses to experience regulatory lag in recovering costs through rates, such that they may not fully recover all costs during the rate effective period and may, therefore, earn less than their allowed returns. Decisions are typically subject to appeal, further exacerbating the regulatory lag and leading to additional uncertainty associated with rate case proceedings. The AEP regulated utility businesses have large customer and stakeholder bases and, as a result, could be the subject of public criticism or adverse publicity focused on issues including the operation and maintenance of their assets and infrastructure, their preparedness for major storms or other extreme weather events and/or the time it takes to restore service after such events, or the quality of their service or the reasonableness of the cost of their service.  Criticism or adverse publicity of this nature could render legislatures and other governing bodies, public service commissions and other regulatory authorities, and government officials less likely to view the applicable operating company in a favorable light and could potentially negatively affect legislative or regulatory processes or outcomes, as well as lead to increased regulatory oversight or more stringent legislative or regulatory requirements or other legislation or regulatory actions that adversely affect the regulated utility businesses.The regulated utility businesses, and the energy industry as a whole, have experienced a period of rising costs and investments and an upward trend in spending, especially with respect to infrastructure investments, which is likely to continue in the foreseeable future and could result in more frequent rate cases and requests for, and the continuation of, cost recovery mechanisms, all of which could face resistance from customers and other stakeholders especially in a rising cost environment, whether due to inflation or high fuel prices or otherwise, and/or in periods of economic decline or hardship.  Significant increases in costs could increase financing needs and otherwise adversely affect AEP’s business, financial position, results of operation, or cash flows.  See Note 4 – Rate Matters included in the 2023 Annual Report for additional information.  21AEP’s transmission investment strategy and execution are dependent on federal and state regulatory policy. (Applies to all Registrants)A significant portion of AEP’s earnings is derived from transmission investments and activities.  FERC policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction.  If the FERC were to adopt a different policy, if states were to limit or restrict such policies, or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected, AEP’s strategy of investing in transmission could be impacted.  Management believes AEP’s experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives AEP an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install, construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities.  However, there can be no assurance that PJM, SPP, ERCOT or other RTOs will authorize new transmission projects or will award such projects to AEP.  Certain elements of AEP’s transmission formula rates have been challenged, which could result in lowered rates and/or refunds of amounts previously collected and thus have an adverse effect on AEP’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. (Applies to all Registrants other than AEP Texas)AEP provides transmission service under rates regulated by the FERC.  The FERC has approved the cost-based formula rate templates used by AEP to calculate its respective annual revenue requirements, but it has not expressly approved the amount of actual capital and operating expenditures to be used in the formula rates.  All aspects of AEP’s rates accepted or approved by the FERC, including the formula rate templates, the rates of return on the actual equity portion of its respective capital structures and the approved targeted capital structures, are subject to challenge by interested parties at the FERC, or by the FERC on its own initiative.  In addition, interested parties may challenge the annual implementation and calculation by AEP of its projected rates and formula rate true-up pursuant to its approved formula rate templates under AEP’s formula rate implementation protocols.  If a challenger can establish that any of these aspects are unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, then the FERC can make appropriate prospective adjustments to them and/or disallow any of AEP’s inclusion of those aspects in the rate setting formula.Inquiries related to rates of return, as well as challenges to the formula rates of other utilities, are ongoing in other proceedings at the FERC.  The results of these proceedings could potentially negatively impact AEP in any future challenges to AEP’s formula rates.  If the FERC orders revenue reductions, including refunds, in any future cases related to its formula rates, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.End-use consumers and entities supplying electricity to end-use consumers may also attempt to influence government and/or regulators to change the rate setting methodologies that apply to AEP, particularly if rates for delivered electricity increase substantially.AEP faces risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements that may impede their development and operating activities.  (Applies to all Registrants)AEP owns, develops, constructs, manages and operates electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities.  A key component of AEP's growth is its ability to construct and operate these facilities.  As part of these operations AEP must periodically apply for licenses and permits from various local, state, federal and other regulatory authorities and abide by their respective conditions.  Should AEP be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits on acceptable terms or resolving third-party challenges to such licenses or permits, should there be a delay in obtaining or renewing necessary licenses or permits or should regulatory authorities initiate any associated investigations or enforcement actions or impose related penalties or disallowances, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  Any failure to negotiate successful project development agreements for new facilities with third-parties could have similar results.Changes in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of electric utility facilities and franchises. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP primarily generates electricity at large central facilities and delivers that electricity to customers over its transmission and distribution facilities to customers usually situated within an exclusive franchise. This method results in economies of scale and generally lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells and microturbines, and distributed generation using either new or existing technology.  Other technologies, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), increase the efficiency of electricity and, as a result, lower the demand for it.   Changes in regulatory policies and advances in batteries or energy storage, wind turbines, small modular reactors and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production and delivery.  These developments can challenge AEP’s competitive ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations, to establish fair regulatory mechanisms and 22to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers.  Further, in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated, subsidized or encouraged through legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply, such resources could displace a higher marginal cost generating units, which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity.AEP may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP’s business plan for the construction of new projects, including providing service to new large load customers, involves a number of risks, including incomplete or inaccurate forecasting, planning and procurement, construction delays, non-performance by equipment and other third-party suppliers and increases in equipment and labor costs.  To limit the risks of these construction projects, AEP’s subsidiaries enter into interconnection and service agreements, equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals, cost recovery and/or siting or environmental permits.  If any of these projects are canceled for any reason, including shifts in large customer needs, preferences or financial stability, failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals, cost recovery and/or siting or environmental permits, significant unrecoverable costs or cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur.  In addition, if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset, an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled.AEP is exposed to nuclear generation risk. (Applies to AEP and I&M)I&M owns the Cook Plant, which consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2,296 MWs, or about a tenth of the regulated generating capacity in the AEP System as of December 31, 2023.  AEP and I&M are, therefore, subject to the risks of nuclear generation, which include the following:•The potential harmful effects on the environment and human health due to an adverse incident/event resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials such as SNF.•Limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations.•Uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts triggered by a loss event (federal law requires owners of nuclear units to purchase the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance unless the NRC specifies a lesser amount and potentially contribute to the coverage for losses of others).•Uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives.There can be no assurance that I&M’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if these risks are triggered.The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities.  In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants.  In addition, although management has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at the Cook Plant, if an incident did occur, it could harm results of operations or financial condition.  A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.  Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S. could require AEP or I&M to make material contributory payments.Costs associated with the operation (including fuel), maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation, in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards, availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities.  Costs also may include replacement power, any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the Cook Plant (whether scheduled or premature), the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs.  The ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the Cook Plant is not assured.AEP subsidiaries are exposed to risks through participation in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets that are beyond their control. (Applies to all Registrants)Results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets.  The rules governing the various RTOs, including SPP and PJM, may also change from time to time which could affect costs or revenues.  Existing, new or changed rules of these RTOs could result in significant additional fees and increased 23costs to participate in those structures, including the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to changes in transmission rate design.  In addition, these RTOs may assess costs resulting from improved transmission reliability, reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission rights.  As members of these RTOs, AEP’s subsidiaries are subject to certain additional risks, including the allocation among existing members, of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in these markets and resolution of complaint cases that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by members of these markets.AEP could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards. (Applies to all Registrants)Owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC and enforced by the FERC.  The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles.  Compliance with new reliability standards may subject AEP to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures.  While management expects to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates, there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner.  If AEP were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, AEP could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates.A substantial portion of the receivables of AEP Texas is concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect its cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.  (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)AEP Texas collects receivables from the distribution of electricity from REPs that supply the electricity it distributes to its customers.  As of December 31, 2023, AEP Texas did business with approximately 124 REPs.  Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for these services or could cause them to delay such payments.  AEP Texas depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis.  Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments.  Applicable PUCT regulations significantly limit the extent to which AEP Texas can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory, and AEP Texas thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort.  In 2023, AEP Texas’ two largest REPs accounted for 41% of its operating revenue.  Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.  If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made by creditors involving payments AEP Texas had received from such REP.Ohio House Bill 6 (HB 6), which provides for beneficial cost recovery for OPCo and for plants owned by OVEC, has come under public scrutiny. (Applies to AEP and OPCo)In 2019, Ohio adopted and implemented HB 6 which benefits OPCo by authorizing rate recovery for certain costs including renewable energy contracts, OVEC’s coal-fired generating units and energy efficiency measures.  AEP and OPCo engaged in lobbying efforts and provided testimony during the legislative process in connection with HB 6.  In July 2020, an investigation led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office resulted in a federal grand jury indictment of an Ohio legislator and associates and Generation Now, an entity registered as a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization, in connection with an alleged racketeering conspiracy involving the adoption of HB 6.  Certain defendants in that case had previously plead guilty and, in March 2023, a federal jury convicted the Ohio legislator and another individual of participating in the racketeering conspiracy.  If certain provisions of HB 6 were to be eliminated, it is unclear whether new legislation addressing similar issues would be adopted.  To the extent that OPCo is unable to recover the costs currently authorized by HB 6, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  In addition, the impact of continued public scrutiny of HB 6 is not known and may have an adverse impact on AEP and OPCo, including their relationship with regulatory and legislative authorities, customers and other stakeholders.  AEP is a defendant in current litigation relating to HB 6 and AEP or OPCo may be involved in future litigation.24RISKS RELATED TO MARKET, ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL VOLATILITY AND OTHER RISKSAEP’s financial performance may be adversely affected if AEP is unable to successfully operate facilities or perform certain corporate functions. (Applies to all Registrants)Performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of generation, transmission and/or distribution facilities.  Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:•Operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes.•Operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements.•Labor disputes.•Compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cybersecurity standards.•Information technology failure that impairs AEP’s information technology infrastructure or disrupts normal business operations.•Information technology failure that affects AEP’s ability to access customer information or causes loss of confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects AEP’s reputation or exposes AEP to legal claims.•Supply chain disruptions and inflation. •Fuel or water supply interruptions caused by transportation constraints, adverse weather such as drought, non-performance by suppliers and other factors.•Catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, hurricanes, tornadoes, ice storms, terrorism (including cyber-terrorism), floods or other similar occurrences.•Fuel costs and related requirements triggered by financial stress in the coal industry.Physical attacks or hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information and damage AEP’s reputation. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP and its regulated utility businesses face physical security and cybersecurity risks as the owner-operators of generation, transmission and/or distribution facilities and as participants in commodities trading.  AEP and its regulated utility businesses own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems.  Further, the computer systems that run these facilities are not completely isolated from external networks.  Parties that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system or AEP operations could view these computer systems, software or networks as targets for cyber-attack.  The Federal government has notified the owners and operators of critical infrastructure, such as AEP, that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has increased the likelihood of a cyber-attack on such systems.  In addition, the electric utility business requires the collection of sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss.A security breach of AEP or its regulated utility businesses’ physical assets or information systems, interconnected entities in RTOs, or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet and/or reliability of the transmission and distribution system.  AEP and its regulated utility businesses could be subject to financial harm associated with ransomware theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information, including sensitive customer, vendor, employee, trading or other confidential data.  A successful cyber-attack on the systems that control generation, transmission, distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing service to customers or collection of revenues.  The breach of certain business systems could affect the ability to correctly record, process and report financial information.  A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to AEP’s reputation.  In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring.AEP and its third-party vendors have been subject, and will likely continue to be subject, to attempts to gain unauthorized access to their technology systems and confidential data or to attempts to disrupt utility and related business operations.  While there have been immaterial incidents of phishing, unauthorized access to technology systems, financial fraud, and disruption of remote access across the AEP subsidiaries, there has been no material impact on business or operations from these attacks to date.  Similarly, some of AEP’s third-party vendors have experienced cybersecurity incidents, though such incidents have not, to AEP’s knowledge, resulted in a material impact to AEP to date.  However, AEP cannot guarantee that security efforts will detect or prevent future breaches, operational incidents, or other breakdowns of technology systems and network infrastructure and cannot provide any assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect in the future.  While AEP maintains insurance relating to cybersecurity events, such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may be insufficient to offset any losses, costs or damages experienced. Also, the market for cybersecurity insurance is relatively new and coverage available for cybersecurity events is evolving as the industry matures.25AEP is subject to standards enacted by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by FERC regarding protection of critical infrastructure assets required for operating North America's bulk electric system.  While AEP believes it is in compliance with such standards and regulations, AEP has been, and may in the future be, found to be in violation of such standards and regulations.  To date, such violations have not resulted in material financial penalties; however, management can give no assurance that compliance efforts will not result in material penalties in the future.  In addition, compliance with or changes in the applicable standards and regulations may subject AEP to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures as well as substantial fines for non-compliance.The failure of AEP or third-party vendor information technology systems, or the failure to enhance existing information technology systems and implement new technology, could adversely affect AEP.  (Applies to all Registrants)AEP’s operations are dependent upon the proper functioning of its internal systems, including the information technology systems that support our underlying business processes.  Any significant failure or malfunction of such information technology systems may result in disruptions of our operations.  In the ordinary course of business, we rely on information technology systems, including the internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities and to store sensitive data, including (i) intellectual property, (ii) proprietary business information, (iii) personally identifiable information of our customers, employees, retirees and shareholders and (iv) data with respect to invoicing and the collection of payments, accounting, procurement, and supply chain activities.  Our information technology systems are dependent upon global communications and cloud service providers, as well as their respective vendors, many of whom have at some point experienced significant system failures and outages in the past and may experience such failures and outages in the future. These providers’ systems are susceptible to cybersecurity and data breaches, outages from fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events. Failure to prevent or mitigate data loss from system failures or outages could materially affect AEP’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows.The amount of taxes imposed on AEP could change. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP is subject to income taxation at the federal level and by certain states and municipalities.  In determining AEP’s income tax liability for these jurisdictions, management monitors changes to the applicable tax laws and related regulations, including tax incentives and credits designed to support the sale of energy from utility scale renewable energy facilities.  While management believes AEP complies with current prevailing laws, one or more taxing jurisdictions could seek to impose incremental or new taxes on the company.  In addition, any adverse developments in tax laws, incentives, credits or regulations, including legislative changes, judicial holdings or administrative interpretations, could have a material and adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations.If AEP is unable to access capital markets or insurance markets on reasonable terms, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP relies on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows or proceeds from the strategic sale of assets and investments, including subsidiaries or portions thereof, and insurance markets to assist in managing its risk and liability profile.  Volatility, increased interest rates and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect AEP’s ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to fund capital needs, including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness.  In addition, AEP has exposure to international banks, including those in Europe, Canada, and Asia. Disruptions in these markets could reduce or restrict the AEP’s ability to secure sufficient liquidity or secure liquidity at reasonable terms.  As of December 31, 2023, approximately 10%, 17%, and 16% of the Registrants’ available credit facilities were with European, Canadian, and Asian banks, respectively.Certain sources of insurance and debt and equity capital have expressed increasing unwillingness to procure insurance for or to invest in companies, such as AEP, that rely on fossil fuels.  The public holds diverse and often conflicting views on the use of fossil fuels.  AEP has multiple stakeholders, including our shareholders, customers, associates, federal and state regulatory authorities, and the communities in which AEP operates, and these stakeholders will often have differing priorities and expectations regarding issues related to the use of fossil fuels.  Any adverse publicity in connection with AEP’s use of fossil fuels could curtail availability from certain sources of capital.  If sources of capital for AEP are reduced and/or expected sale proceeds do not become available, capital costs could increase materially.  Restricted access to capital or insurance markets and/or increased borrowing costs or insurance premiums could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.  If AEP is not able to access debt or equity at competitive rates or at all, the ability to finance its operations and implement its strategy and business plan as scheduled could be adversely affected. An inability to access debt and equity may limit AEP’s ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions that it may otherwise rely on for future growth.26Our financial position may be adversely impacted if announced dispositions do not occur as planned or if assets under strategic evaluation lose value. (Applies to AEP)In April 2023, AEP initiated a sales process for its ownership in AEP Energy and AEP Onsite Partners.  AEP Onsite Partners also owns a 50% interest in NM Renewable Development, LLC, (NMRD).  Separate from the remainder of AEP Onsite Partners, AEP and the joint owner have signed an agreement in December 2023 to sell NMRD to a non-affiliated third-party. Any planned sale of assets and investments, including subsidiaries, may not occur for any number of reasons beyond our control, including regulatory approval.  If AEP is unable to recover the net book value or carrying value of these assets as part of the sale process, it could reduce future net income and impact financial condition.Shareholder activism could cause AEP to incur significant expense, hinder execution of AEP’s business strategy and impact AEP’s stock price. (Applies to all Registrants)Shareholder activism, which can take many forms and arise in a variety of situations, could result in substantial costs and divert management’s and AEP’s board’s attention and resources from AEP’s business.  Additionally, such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to AEP’s future, adversely affect AEP’s relationships with its employees, customers or service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel.  Also, AEP may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters, including for third-party advisors.  AEP’s stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any shareholder activism.Downgrades in AEP’s credit ratings could negatively affect its ability to access capital. (Applies to all Registrants)The credit ratings agencies periodically review AEP’s capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings and cash flows.  Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to AEP and could limit access to funding for operations.  AEP’s business is capital intensive, and AEP is dependent upon the ability to access capital at rates and on terms management determines to be attractive.  If AEP’s ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained, AEP’s interest costs will likely increase and that could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.AEP and AEPTCo have no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other payments due from their subsidiaries. (Applies to AEP and AEPTCo)AEP and AEPTCo are holding companies and have no operations of their own.  Their ability to meet their financial obligations associated with their indebtedness and to pay dividends is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of their operating subsidiaries, primarily their regulated utilities, and the ability of their subsidiaries to pay dividends to them or repay loans from them.  Their subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation (apart from loans from AEP or AEPTCo) to provide them with funds for their payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions or other payments.  Payments to AEP or AEPTCo by their subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations.  AEP and AEPTCo indebtedness and dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness.AEP’s operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions. (Applies to all Registrants)Electric power consumption is generally seasonal.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter.  As a result, overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis.  In addition, AEP has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder.  Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.  In addition, unusually extreme weather conditions could impact AEP’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable.Further, deteriorating economic conditions triggered by any cause, including international tariffs, generally result in reduced consumption by customers, particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely, while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues.  As a result, prevailing economic conditions may reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.27Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan costs and the costs of nuclear decommissioning.  (Applies to all Registrants and to AEP and I&M with respect to the costs of nuclear decommissioning)The costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan, changes in actuarial assumptions, future government regulation, changes in life expectancy and the frequency and amount of AEP’s required or voluntary contributions made to the plans.  Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values, as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund the pension and other postretirement plans, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities, could increase pension and other postretirement expense, and AEP could be required from time to time to fund the pension plan with significant amounts of cash.  Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on liquidity by reducing cash flows and could negatively affect results of operations.  Additionally, I&M holds a significant amount of assets in its nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy obligations to decommission its nuclear plant.  The rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the costs of decommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts.Supply chain disruptions and inflation could negatively impact our operations and corporate strategy. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP’s operations and business plans depend on the global supply chain to procure the equipment, materials and other resources necessary to build and provide services in a safe and reliable manner.  The delivery of components, materials, equipment and other resources that are critical to AEP’s business operations and corporate strategy has been restricted by domestic and global supply chain upheaval.  This has resulted in the shortage of critical items.  International tensions, including the ramifications of regional conflict, could further exacerbate the global supply chain upheaval.  These disruptions and shortages could adversely impact business operations and corporate strategy.  The constraints in the supply chain could restrict the availability and delay the construction, maintenance or repair of items that are needed to support normal operations or are required to execute on AEP’s corporate strategy for continued capital investment in utility equipment and impact AEP’s strategy to transition its generation fleet.  These disruptions and constraints could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm AEP’s financial condition.Supply chain disruptions have contributed to higher prices of components, materials, equipment and other needed commodities and these inflationary increases may continue in the future.  The economy in the United States has encountered a material level of inflation compared to the recent past and that has contributed to increased uncertainty in the outlook of near-term economic activity, including the level of future inflation and the possibility of a recession.  AEP typically recovers increases in capital expenses from customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions.  Failure to recover increased capital costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm AEP’s financial condition.  Increases in inflation raises our costs for labor, materials and services, and failure to secure these on reasonable terms may adversely impact our financial condition.AEP’s results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers, a decline in customer demand or a recession. (Applies to all Registrants)Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities.  Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of AEP, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity, including changes due to public health considerations.Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to further reduce energy consumption.  Additionally, technological advances or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.  Some or all of these factors, could impact the demand for electricity.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants)Certain events, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs.  The challenges include 28potential higher rates of existing employee departures, lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development.  In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise.  Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business.  If AEP is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, future net income and cash flows may be reduced.Changes in the price of purchased power and commodities, the cost of procuring fuel, emission allowances for criteria pollutants and the costs of transport may increase AEP’s cost of purchasing and producing power, impacting financial performance. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of purchased power and fuel (including the cost to procure coal and gas) and the price and availability to transport fuel.  AEP has existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of fuel, but as these contracts end or if they are not honored, AEP may not be able to purchase fuel on terms as favorable as the current contracts. AEP typically recovers increases in fuel expenses and purchased power from customers in regulated jurisdictions.  Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm AEP’s financial condition.   The inability to procure fuel at costs that are economical could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its useful life, and while AEP typically recovers expenditures for undepreciated plant balances, there can be no assurance in the future that AEP will recover such costs.  Similarly, AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances.  AEP uses emission allowances based on the amount of fuel used and reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures.  Based on current environmental programs remaining in effect, AEP has sufficient emission allowances available through either EPA original issuance or market purchases to cover projected needs for the next two years and beyond.  Additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions.  If AEP needs to obtain allowances, those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs.  AEP’s risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge.Prices for coal, natural gas and emission allowances have shown material swings in the past.  Changes in the cost of purchased power, fuel or emission allowances and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.  In addition, actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value trading and marketing transactions, and those differences may be material.  As a result, as those transactions are marked-to-market, they may impact future results of operations and cash flows and impact financial condition.AEP is subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change. (Applies to all Registrants)Climate change creates physical and financial risk.  Physical risks from climate change may include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events, such as fires.  Customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity.  For residential customers, heating and cooling represent their largest energy use.  To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers’ energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes.Increased energy use due to weather changes may require AEP to invest in additional generating assets, transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load.  Decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect financial condition through decreased revenues.  Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stress, including service interruptions.  Weather conditions outside of the AEP service territory could also have an impact on revenues.  AEP buys and sells electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities.  Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on AEP’s own and/or other systems may raise electricity prices as AEP buys short-term energy to serve AEP’s own system, which would increase the cost of energy AEP provides to customers.Severe weather and weather-related events impact AEP’s service territories, primarily when thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, fires, floods and snow or ice storms occur.  To the extent the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and storms increase, AEP’s cost of providing service will increase, including the costs and the availability of procuring insurance related to such impacts, and these costs may not be recoverable.  Changes in wind patterns or in precipitation resulting in droughts, water shortages or floods could adversely affect operations, principally wind generation facilities for changes in wind patterns and the fossil fuel generating units for changes in precipitation.  A change in wind patterns or a negative impact to water supplies due to long-term drought conditions or severe flooding could adversely impact AEP’s ability to provide electricity to customers, as well as increase the price they pay for energy.  AEP may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks.29To the extent climate change impacts a region’s economic health, it may also impact revenues.  AEP’s financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies AEP serves.  The price of energy, as a factor in a region’s cost of living as well as an important input into the cost of goods and services, has an impact on the economic health of the communities within AEP’s service territories.  Climate change may impact the economy, which could impact our sales and revenues.  The cost of additional regulatory requirements, such as regulation of carbon dioxide emissions, could impact the availability of goods and prices charged by AEP’s suppliers which would normally be borne by consumers through higher prices for energy and purchased goods.  To the extent financial markets view climate change and carbon dioxide emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively affect AEP’s ability to access capital markets or cause AEP to receive less than ideal terms and conditions in capital markets.The generation, transmission and distribution of electricity are dangerous and involve inherent risks of damage to private property and injury to AEP’s workforce and the general public. (Applies to all Registrants)Electricity poses hazards for AEP’s workforce and the general public in the event that either comes in contact with electrical current or equipment, including through energized downed power lines or through equipment malfunctions. In addition, the risks associated with the operation of transmission and distribution assets and power generation and storage facilities include public and workforce safety issues and the risk of utility assets causing or contributing to wildfires.  Deaths, injuries and property damage caused by such events can subject AEP to liability that, despite the existence of insurance coverage, can be significant. In addition, AEP may be held responsible for the actions of its contractors. No assurance can be given that future losses will not exceed the limits of AEP’s or its contractors’ insurance coverage.Management cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to AEP’s business activities. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP is involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising out of its business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 6 - Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies included in the 2023 Annual Report.  Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third-parties could interrupt the sales of transmission and distribution services.  (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)AEP Texas transmits and distributes electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third-parties.  If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate, sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.Management is unable to predict the course, results or impact, if any, of current or future litigation or investigations relating to the severe winter weather in Texas in February 2021.  (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas) As a result of the February 2021 severe winter weather in Texas which caused a shortage of electric generation, ERCOT instructed AEP Texas and other Texas electric utilities to initiate power outages to avoid a sustained large-scale outage and prevent long-term damage to the electric system.  At its peak, approximately 468,000 (44%) AEP Texas customers were without power.  In February 2021, AEP Texas received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Office of the Attorney General of Texas requesting, among other data, information about its communications to and from ERCOT, PUCT, retail electric providers, utilities, or power generation companies, concerning power outages related to the February 2021 winter storm.  The company responded to the Civil Investigative Demand in March 2021.AEP Parent and AEP Texas are named in approximately 100 lawsuits alleging multiple claims of wrongful death, personal injury, property damage and other injuries and damages.  Certain wind farms formerly owned by AEP have also been named as defendants in up to approximately 125 lawsuits, along with other Texas energy companies and transmission and distribution utilities.  Most of the lawsuits contain hundreds of plaintiffs and one of the suits is a purported class action on behalf of all customers in ERCOT.  The complaints seek monetary damages among other forms of relief.  The litigation has been consolidated into a multi-district litigation (MDL) proceeding in Texas state court.  The judge overseeing the MDL issued an initial case management order and stayed all proceedings and discovery. Management is unable to predict the course or outcome of these or any future litigation or investigations or their impact, if any, on future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.30Hazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission may result in suspension of AEP’s operations or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.  (Applies to all Registrants)AEP operations are subject to the usual hazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission, including explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, equipment interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other environmental risks.  The hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.  AEP maintains property and casualty insurance, but AEP is not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to AEP’s business, such as damage to poles, towers and lines or losses caused by outages.AEPTCo depends on AEP affiliates for a substantial portion of its revenues.  (Applies to AEPTCo)AEPTCo’s principal transmission service customers are AEP affiliates.  Management expects that these affiliates will continue to be AEPTCo’s principal transmission service customers for the foreseeable future.  For the year ended December 31, 2023, AEP affiliates were responsible for approximately 79% of the consolidated transmission revenues of AEPTCo.Most of the real property rights on which the assets of AEPTCo are situated result from affiliate license agreements and are dependent on the terms of the underlying easements and other rights of its affiliates.  (Applies to AEPTCo)AEPTCo does not hold title to the majority of real property on which its electric transmission assets are located.  Instead, under the provisions of certain affiliate contracts, it is permitted to occupy and maintain its facilities upon real property held by the respective AEP subsidiary utility affiliate that overlay its operations.  The ability of AEPTCo to continue to occupy such real property is dependent upon the terms of such affiliate contracts and upon the underlying real property rights of these utility affiliates, which may be encumbered by easements, mineral rights and other similar encumbrances that may affect the use of such real property.  AEP can give no assurance that (a) the relevant AEP subsidiary utility affiliates will continue to be affiliates of AEPTCo, (b) suitable replacement arrangements can be obtained in the event that the relevant AEP subsidiary utility affiliates are not its affiliates and (c) the underlying easements and other rights are sufficient to permit AEPTCo to operate its assets in a manner free from interruption.Compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements may lead to increased costs and result in penalties. (Applies to all Registrants)Business activities of electric utilities and related companies are heavily regulated, primarily through national and state laws and regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations related to working conditions, health and safety, equal employment opportunity, employee benefit and other labor and employment matters, laws and regulations related to competition and antitrust matters.  Many agencies employ mandatory civil penalty structures for regulatory violations.  Registrants are subject to the jurisdiction of many federal and state agencies, including the FERC, NERC, Commodities Futures Trading Commission, Federal EPA, NRC, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the SEC and the United States Department of Justice which may impose significant civil and criminal penalties to enforce compliance requirements relative to AEP’s business, which could have a material adverse effect on financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations, as well as changes in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase AEP’s operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services AEP offers, or result in adverse publicity and harm AEP’s reputation.31RISKS RELATED TO OWNING AND OPERATING GENERATION ASSETS AND SELLING POWERCosts of compliance with existing and evolving environmental laws are significant. (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)Operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety.  A majority of the electricity generated by AEP subsidiaries is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels.  Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury and particulates and the discharge and disposal of solid waste (including coal-combustion residuals or CCR) resulting from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations, controls and mitigation expenses.  Compliance with these legal requirements (including any new and more stringent application of existing CCR regulations) requires AEP to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees, disposal, remediation and permits at AEP facilities and could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.  Costs of compliance with environmental statutes and regulations could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition, especially if emission limits, CCR waste discharge and/or discharge disposal obligations are tightened, more extensive operating and/or permitting requirements are imposed or additional substances or facilities become regulated.  Although AEP typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies, replacement generation, undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers, there can be no assurance in the future that AEP will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants.  Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition. Regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and/or voluntary climate goals could materially increase costs to AEP and its customers or cause some electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)Federal or state laws or regulations may be adopted that would impose new or additional limits on the emissions of greenhouse gases, including, but not limited to, carbon dioxide and methane, from electric generation units using fossil fuels like coal.  The potential effects of greenhouse gas emission limits on AEP's electric generation units are subject to significant uncertainties based on, among other things, the timing of the implementation of any new requirements, the required levels of emission reductions, the nature of any market-based or tax-based mechanisms adopted to facilitate reductions, the relative availability of greenhouse gas emission reduction offsets, the development of cost-effective, commercial-scale carbon capture and storage technology and supporting regulations and liability mitigation measures, and the range of available compliance alternatives.  AEP routinely submits IRPs in various regulatory jurisdictions to address future generation and capacity needs.  These IRPs take into account economics, customer demand, grid reliability and resilience, regulations and RTO capacity requirements.  The  objective of the IRPs is to recommend future generation and capacity resources that provide the most cost-efficient and reliable power to customers.  Based on the output of the company’s IRPs, in October 2022, AEP announced new intermediate and long-term CO2 emission reduction goals.  AEP adjusted its near-term CO2 emission reduction target from a 2000 baseline to a 2005 baseline, upgraded its 80% reduction by 2030 target to include full Scope 1 emissions and accelerated its net-zero goal by five years to 2045 for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.  Risks to achieving these goals include, among other things, the ability to execute on renewable resource plans, evolving RTO requirements, regulatory approvals, customer demand for carbon-free energy, potential tariffs, carbon policy and regulation, operational performance of renewable generation and supply chain costs and constraints, all while continuing to provide the most cost-efficient and reliable power to customers.  Technology research and development, innovation, and advancements in carbon-free generation are also critical to AEP’s ability to achieve its 2045 goal.AEP’s results of operations could be materially adversely affected to the extent that new federal or state laws or regulations or voluntary climate goals impose any new greenhouse gas emission limits.  Any future limits on greenhouse gas emissions could create substantial additional costs in the form of taxes or emissions allowances, require significant capital investment in carbon capture and storage technology, fuel switching, or the replacement of high-emitting generation facilities with lower-emitting generation facilities and/or could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.  Although AEP typically recovers environmental expenditures, there can be no assurance in the future that AEP can recover such costs which could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition.  Further, real or alleged violations of environmental regulations, including those related to climate change, or an inability to meet AEP’s voluntary climate goals, could adversely impact AEP’s reputation.AEP may be constrained by the ability to procure resources or labor needed to build new generation at a reasonable price as well as to construct projects on time. In addition, new technologies that are not yet commercially available or are unproven at utility scale will likely be needed including new resources such as advanced nuclear, hydrogen and long-duration storage. If these technologies are not developed or are not available at reasonable prices, or if AEP invests in early-stage technologies that are then supplanted by technological breakthroughs, AEP’s ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2045 at a cost-effective price could be at risk. Achieving our carbon reduction goals will require continued operation of our existing carbon-free technologies 32including nuclear and renewables. The rapid transition to and expansion of certain low-carbon resources, such as renewables without cost-effective storage, may challenge our ability to meet customer expectations of reliability in a carbon constrained environment.  AEP cannot predict the ultimate impact of achieving these objectives, or the various implementation aspects, on its system reliability, or its results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.AEP may be unable to procure or construct generation capacity when needed or to recover the costs of such generation capacity.  (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)AEP’s capacity obligations are subject to a number of factors including load growth, requirements that can be imposed by the states, RTOs and other jurisdictions in which it operates or participates as a member and the retirement of existing generating facilities.  AEP must obtain new and replacement generation to comply with prevailing capacity needs and reserve obligations.  AEP’s ability to acquire, retrofit and/or construct power generation facilities in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks.  These variables include, but are not limited to, project management expertise, escalating costs for capital, materials, labor, and environmental compliance, reliance on suppliers for timely and satisfactory performance, continued pandemic-related delays and cost increases, and supply chains and material constraints, including those that may result from major storm events.  Delays in obtaining permits, challenges in securing suitable land for the siting, shortages in materials and qualified labor, levels of public support or opposition, suppliers and contractors not performing as expected or required under their contracts and/or experiencing financial problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations under contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, poor quality initial cost estimates from contractors, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, changes in commodity prices affecting revenue, fuel costs, or materials costs, downward changes in the economy, changes in law or regulation, including environmental compliance requirements, further direct and indirect trade and tariff issues, supply chain delays or disruptions, and other events beyond AEP’s control may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost, and performance of needed acquisitions or construction projects.  If these projects or other capital improvements are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or cancellation, AEP could incur additional costs and termination payments or face increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the project.  In addition, AEP could be exposed to higher costs, penalties and market volatility, which could affect cash flow and cost recovery, should one or more applicable regulator decline to approve the acquisition or construction of the project or new generation needed to meet the reliability needs of customers at the lowest reasonable cost.Courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims in the future may order AEP to pay damages or to limit or reduce emissions. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas and AEPTCo)In the past, there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which AEP, among others, were defendants.  In general, the actions allege that emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance.  The plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief.  If future actions are resolved against AEP, substantial modifications or retirement of AEP’s existing coal-fired power plants could be required, and AEP might be required to purchase power from third-parties to fulfill AEP’s commitments to supply power to AEP customers.  This could have a material impact on revenues.  In addition, AEP could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment, accelerate the timing of capital expenditures, pay damages or penalties and/or halt operations.  Unless recovered, those costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition.  Moreover, results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation.Commodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not eliminated. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)AEP routinely has open trading positions in the market, within guidelines set by AEP, resulting from the management of AEP’s trading portfolio.  To the extent open trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish financial results and financial position.  AEP’s power trading activities also expose AEP to risks of commodity price movements.  To the extent that AEP’s power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns, or controls, AEP would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices.  In connection with these trading activities, AEP routinely enters into financial contracts, including futures and options, OTC options, financially-settled swaps and other derivative contracts.  These activities expose AEP to risks from price movements.  If the values of the financial contracts change in a manner AEP does not anticipate, it could harm financial position or reduce the financial contribution of trading operations.Parties with whom AEP has contracts may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm AEP’s results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP sells power from its generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis.  AEP also enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity, natural gas, emission allowances, renewable energy credits and coal as part of its power marketing and energy trading operations.  AEP is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe AEP 33money or the delivery of a commodity, including power, could breach their obligations.  Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, AEP may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at then-current market prices that may exceed AEP’s contractual prices, which would cause financial results to be diminished and AEP might incur losses.  Although estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty, actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict.AEP relies on electric transmission facilities that AEP does not own or control.  If these facilities do not provide AEP with adequate transmission capacity, AEP may not be able to deliver wholesale electric power to the purchasers of AEP’s power. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power AEP sells at wholesale.  This dependence exposes AEP to a variety of risks.  If transmission is disrupted, or transmission capacity is inadequate, AEP may not be able to sell and deliver AEP wholesale power.  If a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, AEP’s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited.  If restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure.The FERC has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales.  Although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions, access to transmission systems may not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable.  Management also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets.OVEC may require additional liquidity and other capital support.  (Applies to AEP, APCo, I&M and OPCo) AEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies own OVEC. The Inter-Company Power Agreement (ICPA) defines the rights and obligations and sets the power participation ratio of the parties to it. Under the ICPA, parties are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all OVEC capacity (approximately 2,400 MWs) in proportion to their respective power participation ratios. The aggregate power participation ratio of APCo, I&M and OPCo is 43.47%. If a party fails to make payments owed by it under the ICPA, OVEC may not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations, including its ongoing operating expenses as well as its indebtedness.  As of December 31, 2023, OVEC has outstanding indebtedness of approximately $1.1 billion, of which APCo, I&M, and OPCo are collectively responsible for $465 million through the ICPA.  Although they are not an obligor or guarantor, APCo, I&M, and OPCo are responsible for their respective ratio of OVEC’s outstanding debt through the ICPA and if OVEC’s indebtedness is accelerated for any reason, there is risk that APCo, I&M and/or OPCo may be required to pay some or all of such accelerated indebtedness in amounts equal to their aggregate power participation ratio of 43.47%. New climate disclosure rules proposed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission may increase our costs of compliance and adversely impact our business. (Applies to all Registrants)On March 21, 2022, the SEC proposed new rules relating to the disclosure of a range of climate-related risks.  AEP is currently assessing the proposed rule, but at this time AEP cannot predict the costs of implementation or any potential adverse impacts resulting from the rule.  To the extent this rule is finalized as proposed, AEP could incur increased costs relating to the assessment and disclosure of climate-related risks.  AEP may also face increased litigation risks related to disclosures made pursuant to the rule if finalized as proposed.  In addition, enhanced climate disclosure requirements could accelerate the trend of certain stakeholders and lenders restricting or seeking more stringent conditions with respect to their investments in certain carbon-intensive sectors"
7,AEP,AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER CO,2023-02-23,"ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORSGENERAL RISKS OF REGULATED OPERATIONSAEP may not be able to recover the costs of substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP’s business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the construction of additional transmission and renewable generation facilities, modernizing existing infrastructure, installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits as well as other initiatives.  AEP’s public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions.  If these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates charged, affected AEP subsidiaries would not be able to recover the costs associated with their investments.  This would cause financial results to be diminished.Regulated electric revenues and earnings are dependent on federal and state regulation that may limit AEP’s ability to recover costs and other amounts. (Applies to all Registrants)The rates customers pay to AEP regulated utility businesses are subject to approval by the FERC and the respective state utility commissions of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.  In certain instances, AEP’s applicable regulated utility businesses may agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters that are subject to regulatory approval.  AEP cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of any settlements or the actions by the FERC or the respective state commissions in establishing rates.If regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the relevant commissions, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions, which may decrease future earnings.  Additionally, if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.  Similarly, if recovery or other rate relief authorized in the past is overturned or reversed on appeal, future earnings could be negatively impacted.  Any regulatory action or litigation outcome that triggers a reversal of a regulatory asset or deferred cost generally results in an impairment to the balance sheet and a charge to the income statement of the company involved.  See Note 4 – Rate Matters included in the 2022 Annual Report for additional information.  AEP’s transmission investment strategy and execution are dependent on federal and state regulatory policy. (Applies to all Registrants)A significant portion of AEP’s earnings is derived from transmission investments and activities.  FERC policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction.  If the FERC were to adopt a different policy, if states were to limit or restrict such policies, or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected, AEP’s strategy of investing in transmission could be impacted.  Management believes AEP’s experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives AEP an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install, construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities.  However, there can be no assurance that PJM, SPP, ERCOT or other RTOs will authorize new transmission projects or will award such projects to AEP.  Certain elements of AEP’s transmission formula rates have been challenged, which could result in lowered rates and/or refunds of amounts previously collected and thus have an adverse effect on AEP’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. (Applies to all Registrants other than AEP Texas)AEP provides transmission service under rates regulated by the FERC.  The FERC has approved the cost-based formula rate templates used by AEP to calculate its respective annual revenue requirements, but it has not expressly approved the amount of actual capital and operating expenditures to be used in the formula rates.  All aspects of AEP’s rates accepted or approved by the FERC, including the formula rate templates, the rates of return on the 32actual equity portion of its respective capital structures and the approved targeted capital structures, are subject to challenge by interested parties at the FERC, or by the FERC on its own initiative.  In addition, interested parties may challenge the annual implementation and calculation by AEP of its projected rates and formula rate true-up pursuant to its approved formula rate templates under AEP’s formula rate implementation protocols.  If a challenger can establish that any of these aspects are unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, then the FERC can make appropriate prospective adjustments to them and/or disallow any of AEP’s inclusion of those aspects in the rate setting formula.Inquiries related to rates of return, as well as challenges to the formula rates of other utilities, are ongoing in other proceedings at the FERC.  The results of these proceedings could potentially negatively impact AEP in any future challenges to AEP’s formula rates.  If the FERC orders revenue reductions, including refunds, in any future cases related to its formula rates, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.End-use consumers and entities supplying electricity to end-use consumers may also attempt to influence government and/or regulators to change the rate setting methodologies that apply to AEP, particularly if rates for delivered electricity increase substantially.AEP faces risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements that may impede their development and operating activities.  (Applies to all Registrants)AEP owns, develops, constructs, manages and operates electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities.  A key component of AEP's growth is its ability to construct and operate these facilities.  As part of these operations AEP must periodically apply for licenses and permits from various local, state, federal and other regulatory authorities and abide by their respective conditions.  Should AEP be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits on acceptable terms or resolving third-party challenges to such licenses or permits, should there be a delay in obtaining or renewing necessary licenses or permits or should regulatory authorities initiate any associated investigations or enforcement actions or impose related penalties or disallowances, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  Any failure to negotiate successful project development agreements for new facilities with third-parties could have similar results.Changes in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of electric utility facilities and franchises. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP primarily generates electricity at large central facilities and delivers that electricity to customers over its transmission and distribution facilities to customers usually situated within an exclusive franchise. This method results in economies of scale and generally lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells and microturbines, and distributed generation using either new or existing technology.  Other technologies, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), increase the efficiency of electricity and, as a result, lower the demand for it.   Changes in regulatory policies and advances in batteries or energy storage, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production and delivery.  These developments can challenge AEP’s competitive ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations, to establish fair regulatory mechanisms and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers.  Further, in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated, subsidized or encouraged through legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply, such resources could displace a higher marginal cost generating units, which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity.33AEP may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP’s business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks, including construction delays, non-performance by equipment and other third-party suppliers and increases in equipment and labor costs.  To limit the risks of these construction projects, AEP’s subsidiaries enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits.  If any of these projects are canceled for any reason, including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits, significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur.  In addition, if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset, an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled.AEP is exposed to nuclear generation risk. (Applies to AEP and I&M)I&M owns the Cook Plant, which consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2,296 MWs, or about a tenth of the regulated generating capacity in the AEP System.  AEP and I&M are, therefore, subject to the risks of nuclear generation, which include the following:•The potential harmful effects on the environment and human health due to an adverse incident/event resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials such as SNF.•Limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations.•Uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts triggered by a loss event (federal law requires owners of nuclear units to purchase the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance and potentially contribute to the coverage for losses of others).•Uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives.There can be no assurance that I&M’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if these risks are triggered.The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities.  In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants.  In addition, although management has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at the Cook Plant, if an incident did occur, it could harm results of operations or financial condition.  A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.  Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S. could require AEP or I&M to make material contributory payments.Costs associated with the operation (including fuel), maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation, in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards, availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities.  Costs also may include replacement power, any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the Cook Plant (whether scheduled or premature), the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs.  The ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the Cook Plant is not assured.34AEP subsidiaries are exposed to risks through participation in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets that are beyond their control. (Applies to all Registrants)Results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets.  The rules governing the various RTOs, including SPP and PJM, may also change from time to time which could affect costs or revenues.  Existing, new or changed rules of these RTOs could result in significant additional fees and increased costs to participate in those structures, including the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to changes in transmission rate design.  In addition, these RTOs may assess costs resulting from improved transmission reliability, reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission rights.  As members of these RTOs, AEP’s subsidiaries are subject to certain additional risks, including the allocation among existing members, of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in these markets and resolution of complaint cases that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by members of these markets.AEP could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards. (Applies to all Registrants)Owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC and enforced by the FERC.  The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles.  Compliance with new reliability standards may subject AEP to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures.  While management expects to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates, there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner.  If AEP were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, AEP could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates.A substantial portion of the receivables of AEP Texas is concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect its cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.  (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)AEP Texas collects receivables from the distribution of electricity from REPs that supply the electricity it distributes to its customers.  As of December 31, 2022, AEP Texas did business with approximately 127 REPs.  Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for these services or could cause them to delay such payments.  AEP Texas depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis.  Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments.  Applicable PUCT regulations significantly limit the extent to which AEP Texas can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory, and AEP Texas thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort.  In 2022, AEP Texas’ two largest REPs accounted for 45% of its operating revenue.  Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.  If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made by creditors involving payments AEP Texas had received from such REP.Ohio House Bill 6 (HB 6), which provides for beneficial cost recovery for OPCo and for plants owned by OVEC, has come under public scrutiny. (Applies to AEP and OPCo)In 2019, Ohio adopted and implemented HB 6 which benefits OPCo by authorizing rate recovery for certain costs including renewable energy contracts, OVEC’s coal-fired generating units and energy efficiency measures.  AEP and OPCo engaged in lobbying efforts and provided testimony during the legislative process in connection with HB 6.  In July 2020, an investigation led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office resulted in a federal grand jury indictment of an Ohio legislator and associates in connection with an alleged racketeering conspiracy involving the adoption of HB 356.  The outcome of the U.S. Attorney’s Office investigation and its impact on HB 6 is not known.  If certain provisions of HB 6 were to be eliminated, it is unclear whether new legislation addressing similar issues would be adopted.  To the extent that OPCo is unable to recover the costs currently authorized by HB 6, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  In addition, the impact of continued public scrutiny of HB 6 is not known, and may have an adverse impact on AEP and OPCo, including their relationship with regulatory and legislative authorities, customers and other stakeholders.  AEP is a defendant in current litigation relating to HB 6 and AEP or OPCo may be involved in future litigation.RISKS RELATED TO MARKET, ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL VOLATILITY AND OTHER RISKSAEP’s financial performance may be adversely affected if AEP is unable to successfully operate facilities or perform certain corporate functions. (Applies to all Registrants)Performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of generation, transmission and/or distribution facilities.  Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:•Operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes.•Operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements.•Labor disputes.•Compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards.•Information technology failure that impairs AEP’s information technology infrastructure or disrupts normal business operations.•Information technology failure that affects AEP’s ability to access customer information or causes loss of confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects AEP’s reputation or exposes AEP to legal claims.•Supply chain disruptions and inflation. •Fuel or water supply interruptions caused by transportation constraints, adverse weather such as drought, non-performance by suppliers and other factors.•Catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, hurricanes, tornados, ice storms, terrorism (including cyber-terrorism), floods or other similar occurrences.•Fuel costs and related requirements triggered by financial stress in the coal industry.Physical attacks or hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information and damage AEP’s reputation. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP and its regulated utility businesses face physical security and cybersecurity risks as the owner-operators of generation, transmission and/or distribution facilities and as participants in commodities trading.  AEP and its regulated utility businesses own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems.  Further, the computer systems that run these facilities are not completely isolated from external networks.  Parties that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system or AEP operations could view these computer systems, software or networks as targets for cyber-attack.  The Federal government has notified the owners and operators of critical infrastructure, such as AEP, that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has increased the likelihood of a cyber-attack on such systems.  In addition, the electric utility business requires the collection of sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss.A security breach of AEP or its regulated utility businesses’ physical assets or information systems, interconnected entities in RTOs, or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet and/or reliability of the transmission and distribution system.  AEP and its regulated utility businesses could be subject to financial harm associated with ransomware theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information, including sensitive customer, vendor, employee, trading or other confidential data.  A successful cyber-attack on the systems that control generation, transmission, distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing service to customers or collection of revenues.  The breach of certain business systems could affect the ability to 36correctly record, process and report financial information.  A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to AEP’s reputation.  In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring.  AEP and its third-party vendors have been subject, and will likely continue to be subject, to attempts to gain unauthorized access to their technology systems and confidential data or to attempts to disrupt utility and related business operations.  While there have been immaterial incidents of phishing, unauthorized access to technology systems, financial fraud, and disruption of remote access across the AEP System, there has been no material impact on business or operations from these attacks.  However, AEP cannot guarantee that security efforts will detect or prevent breaches, operational incidents, or other breakdowns of technology systems and network infrastructure and cannot provide any assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect in the future.The amount of taxes imposed on AEP could change. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP is subject to income taxation at the federal level and by certain states and municipalities.  In determining AEP’s income tax liability for these jurisdictions, management monitors changes to the applicable tax laws and related regulations, including tax incentives and credits designed to support the sale of energy from utility scale renewable energy facilities.  While management believes AEP complies with current prevailing laws, one or more taxing jurisdictions could seek to impose incremental or new taxes on the company.  In addition, any adverse developments in tax laws, incentives, credits or regulations, including legislative changes, judicial holdings or administrative interpretations, could have a material and adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations.If AEP is unable to access capital markets or insurance markets on reasonable terms, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP relies on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows or proceeds from the strategic sale of assets and investments, including subsidiaries such as the planned sale of KPCo and KTCo and AEP Renewables’ competitive contracted renewable portfolio, and insurance markets to assist in managing its risk and liability profile. Volatility, increased interest rates and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect AEP’s ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to fund capital needs, including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness.  Certain sources of insurance and debt and equity capital have expressed increasing unwillingness to procure insurance for or to invest in companies, such as AEP, that rely on fossil fuels.  The public holds diverse and often conflicting views on the use of fossil fuels.  AEP has multiple stakeholders, including our shareholders, customers, associates, federal and state regulatory authorities, and the communities in which AEP operates, and these stakeholders will often have differing priorities and expectations regarding issues related to the use of fossil fuels.  Any adverse publicity in connection with AEP’s use of fossil fuels could curtail availability from certain sources of capital.  If sources of capital for AEP are reduced and/or expected sale proceeds do not become available, capital costs could increase materially.  Restricted access to capital or insurance markets and/or increased borrowing costs or insurance premiums could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.Our financial position may be adversely impacted if announced dispositions do not occur as planned or if assets under strategic evaluation lose value. (Applies to AEP)In October 2021, AEP entered into an agreement to sell KPCo and KTCo for approximately a $2.85 billion enterprise value.  In September 2022, the agreement was amended to reduce the purchase price to approximately $2.646 billion, among other terms.  The sale remains subject to regulatory approval and if it is not approved on terms acceptable to AEP or if the sale does not occur for any reason, it could reduce future net income and cash flow and impact financial condition.  In February 2023, AEP signed an agreement to sell the AEP Renewables’ competitive contracted renewables portfolio to a nonaffiliated party for $1.5 billion including the assumption of project debt.  The sale is subject to regulatory approval.  Any announced sale of assets and investments, including subsidiaries, may not occur for any number of reasons beyond our control, including regulatory approval on terms that are acceptable.37AEP has initiated a strategic evaluation for its ownership in AEP Energy, a wholly-owned retail energy supplier that supplies electricity and/or natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers.  AEP has not made a decision regarding the potential alternatives and expects to complete the evaluation in the first half of 2023.  Certain of these alternatives could result in a loss which could reduce future net income and cash flow and impact financial condition.  Shareholder activism could cause AEP to incur significant expense, hinder execution of AEP’s business strategy and impact AEP’s stock price. (Applies to all Registrants)Shareholder activism, which can take many forms and arise in a variety of situations, could result in substantial costs and divert management’s and AEP’s board’s attention and resources from AEP’s business.  Additionally, such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to AEP’s future, adversely affect AEP’s relationships with its employees, customers or service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel.  Also, AEP may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters, including for third-party advisors.  AEP’s stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any shareholder activism.Downgrades in AEP’s credit ratings could negatively affect its ability to access capital. (Applies to all Registrants)The credit ratings agencies periodically review AEP’s capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings and cash flows.  Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to AEP and could limit access to funding for operations.  AEP’s business is capital intensive, and AEP is dependent upon the ability to access capital at rates and on terms management determines to be attractive.  If AEP’s ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained, AEP’s interest costs will likely increase and could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.AEP and AEPTCo have no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other payments due from their subsidiaries. (Applies to AEP and AEPTCo)AEP and AEPTCo are holding companies and have no operations of their own.  Their ability to meet their financial obligations associated with their indebtedness and to pay dividends is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of their operating subsidiaries, primarily their regulated utilities, and the ability of their subsidiaries to pay dividends to, or repay loans from them.  Their subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation (apart from loans from AEP or AEPTCo) to provide them with funds for their payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions or other payments.  Payments to AEP or AEPTCo by their subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations.  AEP and AEPTCo indebtedness and dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness.AEP’s operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions. (Applies to all Registrants)Electric power consumption is generally seasonal.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter.  As a result, overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis.  In addition, AEP has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder.  Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.  In addition, unusually extreme weather conditions could impact AEP’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable.Further, deteriorating economic conditions triggered by any cause, including international tariffs, generally result in reduced consumption by customers, particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely, while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues.  As a result, prevailing economic conditions may reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.38Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan costs and the costs of nuclear decommissioning.  (Applies to all Registrants and to AEP and I&M with respect to the costs of nuclear decommissioning)The costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan, changes in actuarial assumptions, future government regulation, changes in life expectancy and the frequency and amount of AEP’s required or voluntary contributions made to the plans.  Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values, as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund the pension and other postretirement plans, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities, could increase pension and other postretirement expense, and AEP could be required from time to time to fund the pension plan with significant amounts of cash.  Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on liquidity by reducing cash flows and could negatively affect results of operations.  Additionally, I&M holds a significant amount of assets in its nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy obligations to decommission its nuclear plant.  The rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the costs of decommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts.Supply chain disruptions and inflation could negatively impact our operations and corporate strategy. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP’s operations and business plans depend on the global supply chain to procure the equipment, materials and other resources necessary to build and provide services in a safe and reliable manner.  The delivery of components, materials, equipment and other resources that are critical to AEP’s business operations and corporate strategy has been restricted by domestic and global supply chain upheaval.  This has resulted in the shortage of critical items.  International tensions, including the ramifications of regional conflict, could further exacerbate the global supply chain upheaval.  These disruptions and shortages could adversely impact business operations and corporate strategy.  The constraints in the supply chain could restrict the availability and delay the construction, maintenance or repair of items that are needed to support normal operations or are required to execute on AEP’s corporate strategy for continued capital investment in utility equipment.  These disruptions and constraints could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm AEP’s financial condition.Supply chain disruptions have contributed to higher prices of components, materials, equipment and other needed commodities and these inflationary increases may continue in the future.  The economy in the United States has encountered a material level of inflation compared to the recent past and that has contributed to increased uncertainty in the outlook of near-term economic activity, including the level of future inflation and the possibility of a recession.  AEP typically recovers increases in capital expenses from customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions.  Failure to recover increased capital costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm AEP’s financial condition.  Increases in inflation raises our costs for labor, materials and services, and failure to secure these on reasonable terms may adversely impact our financial condition.AEP’s results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers, a decline in customer demand or a recession. (Applies to all Registrants)Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities.  Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of AEP, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity, including changes due to public health considerations.Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to further reduce energy consumption.  Additionally, technological advances or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.  Some or all of these factors, could impact the demand for electricity.39Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants)Certain events, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs.  The challenges include potential higher rates of existing employee departures, lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development.  In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise.  Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business.  If AEP is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, future net income and cash flows may be reduced.Changes in the price of purchased power and commodities, the cost of procuring fuel, emission allowances for criteria pollutants and the costs of transport may increase AEP’s cost of purchasing and producing power, impacting financial performance. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of purchased power and fuel (including the cost to procure coal and gas) and the price and availability to transport fuel.  AEP has existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of fuel, but as these contracts end or if they are not honored, AEP may not be able to purchase fuel on terms as favorable as the current contracts. AEP typically recovers increases in fuel expenses and purchased power from customers in regulated jurisdictions.  Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm AEP’s financial condition.   The inability to procure fuel at costs that are economical could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its useful life, and while AEP typically recovers expenditures for undepreciated plant balances, there can be no assurance in the future that AEP will recover such costs.  Similarly, AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances.  AEP uses emission allowances based on the amount of fuel used and reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures.  Based on current environmental programs remaining in effect, AEP has sufficient emission allowances available through either EPA original issuance or market purchases to cover projected needs for the next two years and beyond. Additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions.  If AEP needs to obtain allowances, those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs.  AEP’s risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge.Prices for coal, natural gas and emission allowances have shown material swings in the past.  Changes in the cost of purchased power, fuel or emission allowances and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.In addition, actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value trading and marketing transactions, and those differences may be material.  As a result, as those transactions are marked-to-market, they may impact future results of operations and cash flows and impact financial condition.AEP is subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change. (Applies to all Registrants)Climate change creates physical and financial risk.  Physical risks from climate change may include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events, such as fires.  Customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity.  For residential customers, heating and cooling represent their largest energy use.  To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers’ energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes.Increased energy use due to weather changes may require AEP to invest in additional generating assets, transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load.  Decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect financial condition through decreased revenues.  Extreme weather conditions in general require more system 40backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stress, including service interruptions.  Weather conditions outside of the AEP service territory could also have an impact on revenues.  AEP buys and sells electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities.  Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on AEP’s own and/or other systems may raise electricity prices as AEP buys short-term energy to serve AEP’s own system, which would increase the cost of energy AEP provides to customers.Severe weather and weather-related events impact AEP’s service territories, primarily when thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, fires, floods and snow or ice storms occur.  To the extent the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and storms increase, AEP’s cost of providing service will increase, including the costs and the availability of procuring insurance related to such impacts, and these costs may not be recoverable.  Changes in precipitation resulting in droughts, water shortages or floods could adversely affect operations, principally the fossil fuel generating units.  A negative impact to water supplies due to long-term drought conditions or severe flooding could adversely impact AEP’s ability to provide electricity to customers, as well as increase the price they pay for energy.  AEP may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks.To the extent climate change impacts a region’s economic health, it may also impact revenues.  AEP’s financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies AEP serves.  The price of energy, as a factor in a region’s cost of living as well as an important input into the cost of goods and services, has an impact on the economic health of the communities within the AEP System.Management cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to AEP’s business activities. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP is involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising out of its business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 6 - Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies included in the 2022 Annual Report.  Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third-parties could interrupt the sales of transmission and distribution services.  (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)AEP Texas transmits and distributes electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third-parties.  If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate, sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.41Management is unable to predict the course, results or impact, if any, of current or future litigation or investigations relating to the extreme winter weather in Texas in February 2021.  (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas) As a result of the February 2021 severe winter weather in Texas which caused a shortage of electric generation, ERCOT instructed AEP Texas and other Texas electric utilities to initiate power outages to avoid a sustained large-scale outage and prevent long-term damage to the electric system.  At its peak, approximately 468,000 (44%) AEP Texas customers were without power.  AEP Texas and other AEP entities are named in approximately 100 lawsuits generally alleging the failure to exercise reasonable care in maintaining and updating their generation, transmission and distribution facilities in order to prevent cold weather failures and other related negligence.  The complaints seek monetary damages among other forms of relief.  In February 2021, AEP Texas received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Office of the Attorney General of Texas requesting, among other data, information about its communications to and from ERCOT, PUCT, retail electric providers, utilities, or power generation companies, concerning power outages related to the February 2021 winter storm.  The company responded to the Civil Investigative Demand in March 2021.  Management is unable to predict the course or outcome of these or any future litigation or investigations or their impact, if any, on future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Hazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission may result in suspension of AEP’s operations or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.  (Applies to all Registrants)AEP operations are subject to the usual hazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission, including explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, equipment interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other environmental risks.  The hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.  AEP maintains property and casualty insurance, but AEP is not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to AEP’s business, such as damage to poles, towers and lines or losses caused by outages.AEPTCo depends on its affiliates in the AEP System for a substantial portion of its revenues.  (Applies to AEPTCo)AEPTCo’s principal transmission service customers are its affiliates in the AEP System.  Management expects that these affiliates will continue to be AEPTCo’s principal transmission service customers for the foreseeable future.  For the year ended December 31, 2022, its affiliates were responsible for approximately 79% of the consolidated transmission revenues of AEPTCo.Most of the real property rights on which the assets of AEPTCo are situated result from affiliate license agreements and are dependent on the terms of the underlying easements and other rights of its affiliates.  (Applies to AEPTCo)AEPTCo does not hold title to the majority of real property on which its electric transmission assets are located.  Instead, under the provisions of certain affiliate contracts, it is permitted to occupy and maintain its facilities upon real property held by the respective AEP System utility affiliate that overlay its operations.  The ability of AEPTCo to continue to occupy such real property is dependent upon the terms of such affiliate contracts and upon the underlying real property rights of these utility affiliates, which may be encumbered by easements, mineral rights and other similar encumbrances that may affect the use of such real property.  AEP can give no assurance that (a) the relevant AEP System utility affiliates will continue to be affiliates of AEPTCo, (b) suitable replacement arrangements can be obtained in the event that the relevant AEP System utility affiliates are not its affiliates and (c) the underlying easements and other rights are sufficient to permit AEPTCo to operate its assets in a manner free from interruption.42Compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements may lead to increased costs and result in penalties. (Applies to all Registrants)Business activities of electric utilities and related companies are heavily regulated, primarily through national and state laws and regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations related to working conditions, health and safety, equal employment opportunity, employee benefit and other labor and employment matters, laws and regulations related to competition and antitrust matters.  Many agencies employ mandatory civil penalty structures for regulatory violations.  Registrants are subject to the jurisdiction of many federal and state agencies, including the FERC, NERC, Commodities Futures Trading Commission, Federal EPA, NRC, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the SEC and the United States Department of Justice which may impose significant civil and criminal penalties to enforce compliance requirements relative to AEP’s business, which could have a material adverse effect on financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations, as well as changes in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase AEP’s operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services AEP offers, or result in adverse publicity and harm AEP’s reputation.RISKS RELATED TO OWNING AND OPERATING GENERATION ASSETS AND SELLING POWERCosts of compliance with existing and evolving environmental laws are significant. (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)Operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety.  A majority of the electricity generated by the AEP System is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels.  Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury and particulates and the discharge and disposal of solid waste (including coal-combustion residuals or CCR) resulting from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations, controls and mitigation expenses.  Compliance with these legal requirements (including any new and more stringent application of existing CCR regulations) requires AEP to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees, disposal, remediation and permits at AEP facilities and could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.  Costs of compliance with environmental statutes and regulations could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition, especially if emission limits, CCR waste discharge and/or discharge disposal obligations are tightened, more extensive operating and/or permitting requirements are imposed or additional substances or facilities become regulated.  Although AEP typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies, replacement generation, undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers, there can be no assurance in the future that AEP will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants.  Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition. Regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could materially increase costs to AEP and its customers or cause some electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)Federal or state laws or regulations may be adopted that would impose new or additional limits on the emissions of greenhouse gases, including, but not limited to, carbon dioxide and methane, from electric generation units using fossil fuels like coal.  The potential effects of greenhouse gas emission limits on AEP's electric generation units are subject to significant uncertainties based on, among other things, the timing of the implementation of any new requirements, the required levels of emission reductions, the nature of any market-based or tax-based mechanisms adopted to facilitate reductions, the relative availability of greenhouse gas emission reduction offsets, the development of cost-effective, commercial-scale carbon capture and storage technology and supporting regulations and liability mitigation measures, and the range of available compliance alternatives.  43AEP’s results of operations could be materially adversely affected to the extent that new federal or state laws or regulations impose any new greenhouse gas emission limits.  Any future limits on greenhouse gas emissions could create substantial additional costs in the form of taxes or emissions allowances, require significant capital investment in carbon capture and storage technology, fuel switching, or the replacement of high-emitting generation facilities with lower-emitting generation facilities and/or could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.  Although AEP typically recovers environmental expenditures, there can be no assurance in the future that AEP can recover such costs which could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition.Courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims in the future may order AEP to pay damages or to limit or reduce emissions. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas and AEPTCo)In the past, there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which AEP, among others, were defendants.  In general, the actions allege that emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance.  The plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief.  If future actions are resolved against AEP, substantial modifications or retirement of AEP’s existing coal-fired power plants could be required, and AEP might be required to purchase power from third-parties to fulfill AEP’s commitments to supply power to AEP customers.  This could have a material impact on revenues.  In addition, AEP could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment, accelerate the timing of capital expenditures, pay damages or penalties and/or halt operations.  Unless recovered, those costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition.  Moreover, results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation.Commodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not eliminated. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)AEP routinely has open trading positions in the market, within guidelines set by AEP, resulting from the management of AEP’s trading portfolio.  To the extent open trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish financial results and financial position.AEP’s power trading activities also expose AEP to risks of commodity price movements.  To the extent that AEP’s power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns, or controls, AEP would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices.In connection with these trading activities, AEP routinely enters into financial contracts, including futures and options, OTC options, financially-settled swaps and other derivative contracts.  These activities expose AEP to risks from price movements.  If the values of the financial contracts change in a manner AEP does not anticipate, it could harm financial position or reduce the financial contribution of trading operations.Parties with whom AEP has contracts may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm AEP’s results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP sells power from its generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis.  AEP also enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity, natural gas, emission allowances, renewable energy credits and coal as part of its power marketing and energy trading operations.  AEP is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe AEP money or the delivery of a commodity, including power, could breach their obligations.  Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, AEP may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at then-current market prices that may exceed AEP’s contractual prices, which would cause financial results to be diminished and AEP might incur losses.  Although estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty, actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict.44AEP relies on electric transmission facilities that AEP does not own or control.  If these facilities do not provide AEP with adequate transmission capacity, AEP may not be able to deliver wholesale electric power to the purchasers of AEP’s power. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power AEP sells at wholesale.  This dependence exposes AEP to a variety of risks.  If transmission is disrupted, or transmission capacity is inadequate, AEP may not be able to sell and deliver AEP wholesale power.  If a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, AEP’s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited.  If restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure.The FERC has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales.  Although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions, access to transmission systems may not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable.  Management also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets.OVEC may require additional liquidity and other capital support.  (Applies to AEP, APCo, I&M and OPCo) AEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies own OVEC. The Inter-Company Power Agreement (ICPA) defines the rights and obligations and sets the power participation ratio of the parties to it. Under the ICPA, parties are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all OVEC capacity (approximately 2,400 MWs) in proportion to their respective power participation ratios. The aggregate power participation ratio of APCo, I&M and OPCo is 43.47%. If a party fails to make payments owed by it under the ICPA, OVEC may not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations, including its ongoing operating expenses as well as its indebtedness.  As of December 31, 2022, OVEC has outstanding indebtedness of approximately $1.1 billion, of which APCo, I&M, and OPCo are collectively responsible for $478 million through the ICPA.  Although they are not an obligor or guarantor, APCo, I&M, and OPCo are responsible for their respective ratio of OVEC’s outstanding debt through the ICPA and if OVEC’s indebtedness is accelerated for any reason, there is risk that APCo, I&M and/or OPCo may be required to pay some or all of such accelerated indebtedness in amounts equal to their aggregate power participation ratio of 43.47%. New climate disclosure rules proposed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission may increase our costs of compliance and adversely impact our business. (Applies to all Registrants)On March 21, 2022, the SEC proposed new rules relating to the disclosure of a range of climate-related risks.  AEP is currently assessing the proposed rule, but at this time AEP cannot predict the costs of implementation or any potential adverse impacts resulting from the rule.  To the extent this rule is finalized as proposed, AEP could incur increased costs relating to the assessment and disclosure of climate-related risks.  AEP may also face increased litigation risks related to disclosures made pursuant to the rule if finalized as proposed.  In addition, enhanced climate disclosure requirements could accelerate the trend of certain stakeholders and lenders restricting or seeking more stringent conditions with respect to their investments in certain carbon-intensive sectors"
12,AEP,AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER CO,2022-02-24,"ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORSGENERAL RISKS OF REGULATED OPERATIONSAEP may not be able to recover the costs of substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP’s business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the construction of additional transmission and renewable generation facilities, modernizing existing infrastructure, installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits as well as other initiatives.  AEP’s public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions.  If these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates charged, affected AEP subsidiaries would not be able to recover the costs associated with their investments.  This would cause financial results to be diminished.Regulated electric revenues and earnings are dependent on federal and state regulation that may limit AEP’s ability to recover costs and other amounts. (Applies to all Registrants)The rates customers pay to AEP regulated utility businesses are subject to approval by the FERC and the respective state utility commissions of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.  In certain instances, AEP’s applicable regulated utility businesses may agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters that are subject to regulatory approval.  AEP cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of any settlements or the actions by the FERC or the respective state commissions in establishing rates.If regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the relevant commissions, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions, which may decrease future earnings.  Additionally, if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.  Similarly, if recovery or other rate relief authorized in the past is overturned or reversed on appeal, future earnings could be negatively impacted.  Any regulatory action or litigation outcome that triggers a reversal of a regulatory asset or deferred cost generally results in an impairment to the balance sheet and a charge to the income statement of the company involved.  See Note 4 – Rate Matters included in the 2021 Annual Report for additional information.  AEP’s transmission investment strategy and execution are dependent on federal and state regulatory policy. (Applies to all Registrants)A significant portion of AEP’s earnings is derived from transmission investments and activities.  FERC policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction.  If the FERC were to adopt a different policy, if states were to limit or restrict such policies, or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected, AEP’s strategy of investing in transmission could be impacted.  Management believes AEP’s experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives AEP an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install, construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities.  However, there can be no assurance that PJM, SPP, ERCOT or other RTOs will authorize new transmission projects or will award such projects to AEP.  Certain elements of AEP’s transmission formula rates have been challenged, which could result in lowered rates and/or refunds of amounts previously collected and thus have an adverse effect on AEP’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. (Applies to all Registrants other than AEP Texas)AEP provides transmission service under rates regulated by the FERC.  The FERC has approved the cost-based formula rate templates used by AEP to calculate its respective annual revenue requirements, but it has not expressly approved the amount of actual capital and operating expenditures to be used in the formula rates.  All aspects of AEP’s rates accepted or approved by the FERC, including the formula rate templates, the rates of return on the 35actual equity portion of its respective capital structures and the approved targeted capital structures, are subject to challenge by interested parties at the FERC, or by the FERC on its own initiative.  In addition, interested parties may challenge the annual implementation and calculation by AEP of its projected rates and formula rate true-up pursuant to its approved formula rate templates under AEP’s formula rate implementation protocols.  If a challenger can establish that any of these aspects are unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, then the FERC can make appropriate prospective adjustments to them and/or disallow any of AEP’s inclusion of those aspects in the rate setting formula.Inquiries related to rates of return, as well as challenges to the formula rates of other utilities, are ongoing in other proceedings at the FERC.  The results of these proceedings could potentially negatively impact AEP in any future challenges to AEP’s formula rates.  If the FERC orders revenue reductions, including refunds, in any future cases related to its formula rates, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.End-use consumers and entities supplying electricity to end-use consumers may also attempt to influence government and/or regulators to change the rate setting methodologies that apply to AEP, particularly if rates for delivered electricity increase substantially.AEP faces risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements that may impede their development and operating activities.  (Applies to all Registrants)AEP owns, develops, constructs, manages and operates electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities.  A key component of AEP's growth is its ability to construct and operate these facilities.  As part of these operations AEP must periodically apply for licenses and permits from various local, state, federal and other regulatory authorities and abide by their respective conditions.  Should AEP be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits on acceptable terms or resolving third-party challenges to such licenses or permits, should there be a delay in obtaining or renewing necessary licenses or permits or should regulatory authorities initiate any associated investigations or enforcement actions or impose related penalties or disallowances, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  Any failure to negotiate successful project development agreements for new facilities with third-parties could have similar results.Changes in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of electric utility facilities and franchises. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP primarily generates electricity at large central facilities and delivers that electricity to customers over its transmission and distribution facilities to customers usually situated within an exclusive franchise. This method results in economies of scale and generally lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells and microturbines, and distributed generation using either new or existing technology.  Other technologies, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), increase the efficiency of electricity and, as a result, lower the demand for it.   Changes in regulatory policies and advances in batteries or energy storage, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production and delivery.  These developments can challenge AEP’s competitive ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations, to establish fair regulatory mechanisms and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers.  Further, in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated, subsidized or encouraged through legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply, such resources could displace a higher marginal cost generating units, which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity.36AEP may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP’s business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks, including construction delays, non-performance by equipment and other third-party suppliers and increases in equipment and labor costs.  To limit the risks of these construction projects, AEP’s subsidiaries enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits.  If any of these projects are canceled for any reason, including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits, significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur.  In addition, if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset, an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled.AEP is exposed to nuclear generation risk. (Applies to AEP and I&M)I&M owns the Cook Plant, which consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2,296 MWs, or about 7% of the generating capacity in the AEP System.  AEP and I&M are, therefore, subject to the risks of nuclear generation, which include the following:•The potential harmful effects on the environment and human health due to an adverse incident/event resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials such as SNF.•Limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations.•Uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts triggered by a loss event (federal law requires owners of nuclear units to purchase the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance and potentially contribute to the coverage for losses of others).•Uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives.There can be no assurance that I&M’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if these risks are triggered.The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities.  In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants.  In addition, although management has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at the Cook Plant, if an incident did occur, it could harm results of operations or financial condition.  A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.  Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S. could require AEP or I&M to make material contributory payments.Costs associated with the operation (including fuel), maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation, in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards, availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities.  Costs also may include replacement power, any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the Cook Plant (whether scheduled or premature), the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs.  The ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the Cook Plant is not assured.37AEP subsidiaries are exposed to risks through participation in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets that are beyond their control. (Applies to all Registrants)Results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets.  The rules governing the various RTOs, including SPP and PJM, may also change from time to time which could affect costs or revenues.  Existing, new or changed rules of these RTOs could result in significant additional fees and increased costs to participate in those structures, including the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to changes in transmission rate design.  In addition, these RTOs may assess costs resulting from improved transmission reliability, reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission rights.  As members of these RTOs, AEP’s subsidiaries are subject to certain additional risks, including the allocation among existing members, of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in these markets and resolution of complaint cases that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by members of these markets.AEP could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards. (Applies to all Registrants)Owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC and enforced by the FERC.  The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles.  Compliance with new reliability standards may subject AEP to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures.  While management expects to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates, there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner.  If AEP were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, AEP could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates.A substantial portion of the receivables of AEP Texas is concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect its cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.  (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)AEP Texas collects receivables from the distribution of electricity from REPs that supply the electricity it distributes to its customers.  As of December 31, 2021, AEP Texas did business with approximately 123 REPs.  Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for these services or could cause them to delay such payments.  AEP Texas depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis.  Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments.  Applicable PUCT regulations significantly limit the extent to which AEP Texas can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory, and AEP Texas thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort.  In 2021, AEP Texas’ three largest REPs accounted for 43% of its operating revenue.  Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.  If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made by creditors involving payments AEP Texas had received from such REP.Ohio House Bill 6 (HB 6), which provides for beneficial cost recovery for OPCo and for plants owned by OVEC, has come under public scrutiny. (Applies to AEP and OPCo)In 2019, Ohio adopted and implemented HB 6 which benefits OPCo by authorizing rate recovery for certain costs including renewable energy contracts, OVEC’s coal-fired generating units and energy efficiency measures.  AEP and OPCo engaged in lobbying efforts and provided testimony during the legislative process in connection with HB 6.  In July 2020, an investigation led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office resulted in a federal grand jury indictment of an Ohio legislator and associates in connection with an alleged racketeering conspiracy involving the adoption of HB 386.  The outcome of the U.S. Attorney’s Office investigation and its impact on HB 6 is not known.  If certain provisions of HB 6 were to be eliminated, it is unclear whether new legislation addressing similar issues would be adopted.  To the extent that OPCo is unable to recover the costs currently authorized by HB 6, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  In addition, the impact of continued public scrutiny of HB 6 is not known, and may have an adverse impact on AEP and OPCo, including their relationship with regulatory and legislative authorities, customers and other stakeholders.  AEP is a defendant in current litigation relating to HB6 and AEP or OPCo may be involved in future litigation.RISKS RELATED TO MARKET, ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL VOLATILITY AND OTHER RISKSAEP’s financial condition and results of operations could continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic. (Applies to all Registrants)The global 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic is an evolving situation that has caused and could continue to lead to extended disruption of economic activity in AEP’s markets. COVID-19 could negatively affect AEP’s ability to operate its generating and transmission and distribution assets, its ability to access capital markets and results of operations. AEP currently cannot estimate the potential impact to its financial position, results of operations and cash flows caused by COVID-19, which will depend on future developments and which are highly uncertain at this time. See Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview for additional information on COVID-19.AEP’s financial performance may be adversely affected if AEP is unable to successfully operate facilities or perform certain corporate functions. (Applies to all Registrants)Performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of generation, transmission and/or distribution facilities.  Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:•Operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes.•Operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements.•Labor disputes.•Compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards.•Information technology failure that impairs AEP’s information technology infrastructure or disrupts normal business operations.•Information technology failure that affects AEP’s ability to access customer information or causes loss of confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects AEP’s reputation or exposes AEP to legal claims.•Supply chain disruptions and inflation. •Fuel or water supply interruptions caused by transportation constraints, adverse weather such as drought, non-performance by suppliers and other factors.•Catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, hurricanes, tornados, ice storms, terrorism (including cyber-terrorism), floods or other similar occurrences.•Fuel costs and related requirements triggered by financial stress in the coal industry.Physical attacks or hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information and damage AEP’s reputation. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP and its regulated utility businesses face physical security and cybersecurity risks as the owner-operators of generation, transmission and/or distribution facilities and as participants in commodities trading.  AEP and its regulated utility businesses own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems.  Further, the computer systems that run these facilities are not completely isolated from external networks.  Parties that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system or AEP operations could view these computer systems, software or networks as targets for cyber-attack.  In addition, the electric utility business requires the collection of sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is 39subject to electronic theft or loss.A security breach of AEP or its regulated utility businesses’ physical assets or information systems, interconnected entities in RTOs, or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet and/or reliability of the transmission and distribution system.  AEP and its regulated utility businesses could be subject to financial harm associated with ransomware theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information, including sensitive customer, vendor, employee, trading or other confidential data.  A successful cyber-attack on the systems that control generation, transmission, distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing service to customers or collection of revenues.  The breach of certain business systems could affect the ability to correctly record, process and report financial information.  A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to AEP’s reputation.  In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring.  AEP and its third-party vendors have been subject, and will likely continue to be subject, to attempts to gain unauthorized access to their technology systems and confidential data or to attempts to disrupt utility and related business operations.  While there have been immaterial incidents of phishing, unauthorized access to technology systems, financial fraud, and disruption of remote access across the AEP System, there has been no material impact on business or operations from these attacks.  However, the AEP cannot guarantee that security efforts will detect or prevent breaches, operational incidents, or other breakdowns of technology systems and network infrastructure and cannot provide any assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect in the future.The rate of taxes imposed on AEP could change. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP is subject to income taxation at the federal level and by certain states and municipalities.  In determining AEP’s income tax liability for these jurisdictions, management monitors changes to the applicable tax laws and related regulations.  While management believes it is in compliance with current prevailing laws, one or more taxing jurisdictions could seek to impose incremental or new taxes on the company.  In addition, the Biden administration has proposed and congressional leaders have considered significant changes in tax law and regulations that could result in additional federal income taxes being imposed on AEP.  Any adverse developments in these laws or regulations, including legislative changes, judicial holdings or administrative interpretations, could have a material and adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations.If AEP is unable to access capital markets or insurance markets on reasonable terms, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP relies on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows or proceeds from the strategic sale of assets and investments, including subsidiaries such as the planned sale of KPCo and KTCo, and insurance markets to assist in managing its risk and liability profile.  Volatility, increased interest rates and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect AEP’s ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to fund capital needs, including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness.  Certain sources of insurance and debt and equity capital have expressed increasing unwillingness to procure insurance for or to invest in companies, such as AEP, that rely on fossil fuels.  Any planned sale of assets and investments, including subsidiaries, may not occur for any number of reasons beyond our control, including regulatory approval on terms that are acceptable. If sources of capital for AEP are reduced and/or expected sale proceeds do not become available, capital costs could increase materially.  Restricted access to capital or insurance markets and/or increased borrowing costs or insurance premiums could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.Shareholder activism could cause AEP to incur significant expense, hinder execution of AEP’s business strategy and impact AEP’s stock price. (Applies to all Registrants)Shareholder activism, which can take many forms and arise in a variety of situations, could result in substantial costs and divert management’s and AEP’s board’s attention and resources from AEP’s business.  Additionally, such 40shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to AEP’s future, adversely affect AEP’s relationships with its employees, customers or service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel.  Also, AEP may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters, including for third-party advisors.  AEP’s stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any shareholder activism.The announced phasing out of LIBOR may adversely affect the costs and availability of financing. (Applies to all Registrants)A portion of the Registrants’ indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates, primarily based on the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) for deposits of U.S. dollars.  On November 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve and the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom announced that LIBOR would be phased out completely by June 20, 2023 and replaced by the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") and certain LIBOR maturities have already been phased out.  However, because SOFR is a broad U.S. Treasury repo financing rate that represents overnight secured funding transactions, it differs fundamentally from U.S. dollar LIBOR and the SOFR market is not yet fully developed.  In addition, the overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR.  Uncertainty as to the nature of such phase-out and alternative reference rates or disruption in the financial market could cause interest rates to increase.  If sources of capital for the Registrants are reduced, capital costs could increase materially.  Restricted access to capital markets and/or increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition and/or liquidity.Downgrades in AEP’s credit ratings could negatively affect its ability to access capital. (Applies to all Registrants)The credit ratings agencies periodically review AEP’s capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings and cash flows.  Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to AEP and could limit access to funding for operations.  AEP’s business is capital intensive, and AEP is dependent upon the ability to access capital at rates and on terms management determines to be attractive.  If AEP’s ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained, AEP’s interest costs will likely increase and could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.AEP and AEPTCo have no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other payments due from their subsidiaries. (Applies to AEP and AEPTCo)AEP and AEPTCo are holding companies and have no operations of their own.  Their ability to meet their financial obligations associated with their indebtedness and to pay dividends is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of their operating subsidiaries, primarily their regulated utilities, and the ability of their subsidiaries to pay dividends to, or repay loans from them.  Their subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation (apart from loans from AEP or AEPTCo) to provide them with funds for their payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions or other payments.  Payments to AEP or AEPTCo by their subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations.  AEP and AEPTCo indebtedness and dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness.AEP’s operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions. (Applies to all Registrants)Electric power consumption is generally seasonal.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter.  As a result, overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis.  In addition, AEP has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder.  Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.  In addition, unusually extreme weather conditions could impact AEP’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable.41Further, deteriorating economic conditions triggered by any cause, including international tariffs, generally result in reduced consumption by customers, particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely, while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues.  As a result, prevailing economic conditions may reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan costs and the costs of nuclear decommissioning.  (Applies to all Registrants and to AEP and I&M with respect to the costs of nuclear decommissioning)The costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan, changes in actuarial assumptions, future government regulation, changes in life expectancy and the frequency and amount of AEP’s required or voluntary contributions made to the plans.  Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values, as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund the pension and other postretirement plans, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities, could increase pension and other postretirement expense, and AEP could be required from time to time to fund the pension plan with significant amounts of cash.  Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on liquidity by reducing cash flows and could negatively affect results of operations.  Additionally, I&M holds a significant amount of assets in its nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy obligations to decommission its nuclear plant.  The rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the costs of decommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts.Supply chain disruptions and inflation could negatively impact our operations and corporate strategy. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP’s operations and business plans depend on the global supply chain to procure the equipment, materials and other resources necessary to build and provide services in a safe and reliable manner.  The delivery of components, materials, equipment and other resources that are critical to our business operations and corporate strategy has been restricted by the current domestic and global supply chain upheaval.  This has resulted in the shortage of critical items.  These disruptions and shortages could adversely impact both our business operations and corporate strategy.  The constraints in the supply chain could restrict the availability and delay the construction, maintenance or repair of items that are needed to support normal operations or are required to execute on our corporate strategy for continued capital investment in utility equipment.  These disruptions and constraints could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm AEP’s financial condition.Supply chain disruptions have contributed to higher prices of components, materials, equipment and other needed commodities and these inflationary increases may continue in the future.  While inflation in the United States has been relatively low in recent years, during 2021, the economy in the United States encountered a material level of inflation.  The impact of COVID-19 continues to increase uncertainty in the outlook of near-term economic activity, including whether inflation will continue and at what rate.  AEP typically recovers increases in capital expenses from customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions.  Failure to recover increased capital costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm AEP’s financial condition.  Increases in inflation raises our costs for labor, materials and services, and failure to secure these on reasonable terms may adversely impact our financial condition.AEP’s results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers, or decline in customer demand. (Applies to all Registrants)Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities.  Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of AEP, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand-side 42management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity, including changes due to public health considerations.Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to further reduce energy consumption.  Additionally, technological advances or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.  Some or all of these factors, could impact the demand for electricity.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants)Certain events, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, employee reaction to comply with potential COVID-19 vaccination or testing mandates, mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs.  The challenges include potential higher rates of existing employee departures, lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development.  In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, safety costs and costs of compliance with potential COVID-19 vaccination or testing mandates, may rise.  Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business.  If AEP is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, future net income and cash flows may be reduced.Changes in the price of commodities, the cost of procuring fuel, emission allowances for criteria pollutants and the costs of transport may increase AEP’s cost of producing power, impacting financial performance. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of fuel (including the cost to procure coal and gas) and the price and availability to transport fuel.  AEP has existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of fuel, but as these contracts end or if they are not honored, AEP may not be able to purchase fuel on terms as favorable as the current contracts.  The inability to procure fuel at costs that are economical could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its useful life, and while AEP typically recovers expenditures for undepreciated plant balances, there can be no assurance in the future that AEP will recover such costs.  Similarly, AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances.  AEP uses emission allowances based on the amount of fuel used and reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures.  Based on current environmental programs remaining in effect, AEP has sufficient emission allowances to cover the majority of the projected needs for the next two years and beyond.  Additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions.  If AEP needs to obtain allowances, those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs.  AEP’s risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge.Prices for coal, natural gas and emission allowances have shown material swings in the past.  Changes in the cost of fuel, emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.In addition, actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value trading and marketing transactions, and those differences may be material.  As a result, as those transactions are marked-to-market, they may impact future results of operations and cash flows and impact financial condition.43AEP is subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change. (Applies to all Registrants)Climate change creates physical and financial risk.  Physical risks from climate change may include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events, such as fires.  Customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity.  For residential customers, heating and cooling represent their largest energy use.  To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers’ energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes.Increased energy use due to weather changes may require AEP to invest in additional generating assets, transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load.  Decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect financial condition through decreased revenues.  Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stress, including service interruptions.  Weather conditions outside of the AEP service territory could also have an impact on revenues.  AEP buys and sells electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities.  Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on AEP’s own and/or other systems may raise electricity prices as AEP buys short-term energy to serve AEP’s own system, which would increase the cost of energy AEP provides to customers.Severe weather and weather-related events impact AEP’s service territories, primarily when thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, fires, floods and snow or ice storms occur.  To the extent the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and storms increase, AEP’s cost of providing service will increase, including the costs and the availability of procuring insurance related to such impacts, and these costs may not be recoverable.  Changes in precipitation resulting in droughts, water shortages or floods could adversely affect operations, principally the fossil fuel generating units.  A negative impact to water supplies due to long-term drought conditions or severe flooding could adversely impact AEP’s ability to provide electricity to customers, as well as increase the price they pay for energy.  AEP may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks.To the extent climate change impacts a region’s economic health, it may also impact revenues.  AEP’s financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies AEP serves.  The price of energy, as a factor in a region’s cost of living as well as an important input into the cost of goods and services, has an impact on the economic health of the communities within the AEP System.Management cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to AEP’s business activities. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP is involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising out of its business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 6 - Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies included in the 2021 Annual Report.  Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third-parties could interrupt the sales of transmission and distribution services.  (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)AEP Texas transmits and distributes electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third-parties.  If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate, sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.44Management is unable to predict the course, results or impact, if any, of current or future litigation or investigations relating to the extreme winter weather in Texas in February 2021.  (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas) As a result of the February 2021 severe winter weather in Texas which caused a shortage of electric generation, ERCOT instructed AEP Texas and other Texas electric utilities to initiate power outages to avoid a sustained large-scale outage and prevent long-term damage to the electric system.  At its peak, approximately 468,000 (44%) AEP Texas customers were without power.  AEP Texas and other AEP entities are named in approximately 100 lawsuits generally alleging the failure to exercise reasonable care in maintaining and updating their generation, transmission and distribution facilities in order to prevent cold weather failures and other related negligence.  The complaints seek monetary damages among other forms of relief.  In February 2021, AEP Texas received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Office of the Attorney General of Texas requesting, among other data, information about its communications to and from ERCOT, PUCT, retail electric providers, utilities, or power generation companies, concerning power outages related to the February 2021 winter storm.  The company responded to the Civil Investigative Demand in March 2021.  Management is unable to predict the course or outcome of these or any future litigation or investigations or their impact, if any, on future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Hazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission may result in suspension of AEP’s operations or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.  (Applies to all Registrants)AEP operations are subject to the usual hazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission, including explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, equipment interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other environmental risks.  The hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.  AEP maintains property and casualty insurance, but AEP is not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to AEP’s business, such as damage to poles, towers and lines or losses caused by outages.AEPTCo depends on its affiliates in the AEP System for a substantial portion of its revenues.  (Applies to AEPTCo)AEPTCo’s principal transmission service customers are its affiliates in the AEP System.  Management expects that these affiliates will continue to be AEPTCo’s principal transmission service customers for the foreseeable future.  For the year ended December 31, 2021, its affiliates were responsible for approximately 79% of the consolidated transmission revenues of AEPTCo.Most of the real property rights on which the assets of AEPTCo are situated result from affiliate license agreements and are dependent on the terms of the underlying easements and other rights of its affiliates.  (Applies to AEPTCo)AEPTCo does not hold title to the majority of real property on which its electric transmission assets are located.  Instead, under the provisions of certain affiliate contracts, it is permitted to occupy and maintain its facilities upon real property held by the respective AEP System utility affiliate that overlay its operations.  The ability of AEPTCo to continue to occupy such real property is dependent upon the terms of such affiliate contracts and upon the underlying real property rights of these utility affiliates, which may be encumbered by easements, mineral rights and other similar encumbrances that may affect the use of such real property.  AEP can give no assurance that (a) the relevant AEP System utility affiliates will continue to be affiliates of AEPTCo, (b) suitable replacement arrangements can be obtained in the event that the relevant AEP System utility affiliates are not its affiliates and (c) the underlying easements and other rights are sufficient to permit AEPTCo to operate its assets in a manner free from interruption.45Compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements may lead to increased costs and result in penalties. (Applies to all Registrants)Business activities of electric utilities and related companies are heavily regulated, primarily through national and state laws and regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations related to working conditions, health and safety, equal employment opportunity, employee benefit and other labor and employment matters, laws and regulations related to competition and antitrust matters.  Many agencies employ mandatory civil penalty structures for regulatory violations.  Registrants are subject to the jurisdiction of many federal and state agencies, including the FERC, NERC, Commodities Futures Trading Commission, Federal EPA, NRC, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the SEC and the United States Department of Justice which may impose significant civil and criminal penalties to enforce compliance requirements relative to AEP’s business, which could have a material adverse effect on financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations, as well as changes in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase AEP’s operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services AEP offers, or result in adverse publicity and harm AEP’s reputation.RISKS RELATED TO OWNING AND OPERATING GENERATION ASSETS AND SELLING POWERCosts of compliance with existing and evolving environmental laws are significant. (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo)Operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety.  A majority of the electricity generated by the AEP System is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels.  Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury and particulates and the discharge and disposal of solid waste (including coal-combustion residuals or CCR) resulting from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations, controls and mitigation expenses.  Compliance with these legal requirements (including any new and more stringent application of existing CCR regulations) requires AEP to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees, disposal, remediation and permits at AEP facilities and could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.  Costs of compliance with environmental statutes and regulations could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition, especially if emission limits, CCR waste discharge and/or discharge disposal obligations are tightened, more extensive operating and/or permitting requirements are imposed or additional substances or facilities become regulated.  Although AEP typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies, replacement generation, undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers, there can be no assurance in the future that AEP will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants.  Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition. Regulation of CO2 emissions could materially increase costs to AEP and its customers or cause some electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)To date, federal court decisions have blocked Federal EPA’s attempts to regulate CO2 emissions from existing utility units.  While there are no federal CO2 regulations in effect at present, the current administration has announced addressing climate change as a policy priority.  Costs of compliance with the environmental regulation of CO2 emissions, if any, could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition and/or could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.  Although AEP typically recovers environmental expenditures, there can be no assurance in the future that AEP can recover such costs which could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition.46Courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims in the future may order AEP to pay damages or to limit or reduce emissions. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas and AEPTCo)In the past, there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which AEP, among others, were defendants.  In general, the actions allege that emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance.  The plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief.  If future actions are resolved against AEP, substantial modifications or retirement of AEP’s existing coal-fired power plants could be required, and AEP might be required to purchase power from third-parties to fulfill AEP’s commitments to supply power to AEP customers.  This could have a material impact on revenues.  In addition, AEP could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment, accelerate the timing of capital expenditures, pay damages or penalties and/or halt operations.  Unless recovered, those costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition.  Moreover, results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation.Commodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not eliminated. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)AEP routinely has open trading positions in the market, within guidelines set by AEP, resulting from the management of AEP’s trading portfolio.  To the extent open trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish financial results and financial position.AEP’s power trading activities also expose AEP to risks of commodity price movements.  To the extent that AEP’s power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns, or controls, AEP would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices.In connection with these trading activities, AEP routinely enters into financial contracts, including futures and options, OTC options, financially-settled swaps and other derivative contracts.  These activities expose AEP to risks from price movements.  If the values of the financial contracts change in a manner AEP does not anticipate, it could harm financial position or reduce the financial contribution of trading operations.Parties with whom AEP has contracts may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm AEP’s results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP sells power from its generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis.  AEP also enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity, natural gas, emission allowances, renewable energy credits and coal as part of its power marketing and energy trading operations.  AEP is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe AEP money or the delivery of a commodity, including power, could breach their obligations.  Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, AEP may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at then-current market prices that may exceed AEP’s contractual prices, which would cause financial results to be diminished and AEP might incur losses.  Although estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty, actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict.AEP relies on electric transmission facilities that AEP does not own or control.  If these facilities do not provide AEP with adequate transmission capacity, AEP may not be able to deliver wholesale electric power to the purchasers of AEP’s power. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power AEP sells at wholesale.  This dependence exposes AEP to a variety of risks.  If transmission is disrupted, or transmission capacity is inadequate, AEP may not be able to sell and deliver AEP wholesale power.  If a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, AEP’s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited.  If 47restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure.The FERC has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales.  Although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions, access to transmission systems may not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable.  Management also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets.OVEC may require additional liquidity and other capital support.  (Applies to AEP, APCo, I&M and OPCo) AEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies own OVEC. The Inter-Company Power Agreement (ICPA) defines the rights and obligations and sets the power participation ratio of the parties to it. Under the ICPA, parties are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all OVEC capacity (approximately 2,400 MWs) in proportion to their respective power participation ratios. The aggregate power participation ratio of APCo, I&M and OPCo is 43.47%. If a party fails to make payments owed by it under the ICPA, OVEC may not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations, including its ongoing operating expenses as well as its indebtedness.  As of December 31, 2021, OVEC has outstanding indebtedness of approximately $1.1 billion, of which APCo, I&M, and OPCo are collectively responsible for $492 million through the ICPA.  Although they are not an obligor or guarantor, APCo, I&M, and OPCo are responsible for their respective ratio of OVEC’s outstanding debt through the ICPA and if OVEC’s indebtedness is accelerated for any reason, there is risk that APCo, I&M and/or OPCo may be required to pay some or all of such accelerated indebtedness in amounts equal to their aggregate power participation ratio of 43.47%"
9,AEP,AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER CO,2021-02-25,"ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORSGENERAL RISKS OF REGULATED OPERATIONSAEP may not be able to recover the costs of substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP’s business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the construction of additional transmission facilities, modernizing existing infrastructure, installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits as well as other initiatives.  AEP’s public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions.  If these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates charged, affected AEP subsidiaries would not be able to recover the costs associated with their investments.  This would cause financial results to be diminished.Regulated electric revenues and earnings are dependent on federal and state regulation that may limit AEP’s ability to recover costs and other amounts. (Applies to all Registrants)The rates customers pay to AEP regulated utility businesses are subject to approval by the FERC and the respective state utility commissions of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.  In certain instances, AEP’s applicable regulated utility businesses may agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters that are subject to regulatory approval.  AEP cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of any settlements or the actions by the FERC or the respective state commissions in establishing rates.If regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the relevant commissions, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions, which may decrease future earnings.  Additionally, if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.  Similarly, if recovery or other rate relief authorized in the past is overturned or reversed on appeal, future earnings could be negatively impacted.  Any regulatory action or litigation outcome that triggers a reversal of a regulatory asset or deferred cost generally results in an impairment to the balance sheet and a charge to the income statement of the company involved.  See Note 4 – Rate Matters included in the 2020 Annual Report for additional information.  AEP’s transmission investment strategy and execution are dependent on federal and state regulatory policy. (Applies to all Registrants)A significant portion of AEP’s earnings is derived from transmission investments and activities.  FERC policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction.  If the FERC were to adopt a different policy, if states were to limit or restrict such policies, or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected, AEP’s strategy of investing in transmission could be impacted.  Management believes AEP’s experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives AEP an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install, construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities.  However, there can be no assurance that PJM, SPP, ERCOT or other RTOs will authorize new transmission projects or will award such projects to AEP.  Certain elements of AEP’s transmission formula rates have been challenged, which could result in lowered rates and/or refunds of amounts previously collected and thus have an adverse effect on AEP’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. (Applies to all Registrants other than AEP Texas)AEP provides transmission service under rates regulated by the FERC.  The FERC has approved the cost-based formula rate templates used by AEP to calculate its respective annual revenue requirements, but it has not expressly approved the amount of actual capital and operating expenditures to be used in the formula rates.  All aspects of AEP’s rates accepted or approved by the FERC, including the formula rate templates, the rates of return on the 34actual equity portion of its respective capital structures and the approved targeted capital structures, are subject to challenge by interested parties at the FERC, or by the FERC on its own initiative.  In addition, interested parties may challenge the annual implementation and calculation by AEP of its projected rates and formula rate true-up pursuant to its approved formula rate templates under AEP’s formula rate implementation protocols.  If a challenger can establish that any of these aspects are unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, then the FERC can make appropriate prospective adjustments to them and/or disallow any of AEP’s inclusion of those aspects in the rate setting formula.AEP settled challenges to its SPP and PJM formula rates in proceedings at the FERC in 2019.  However, inquiries related to rates of return, as well as challenges to the formula rates of other utilities, are ongoing in other proceedings at the FERC.  The results of these proceedings could potentially negatively impact AEP in any future challenges to AEP’s formula rates.  If the FERC orders revenue reductions, including refunds, in any future cases related to its formula rates, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.End-use consumers and entities supplying electricity to end-use consumers may also attempt to influence government and/or regulators to change the rate setting methodologies that apply to AEP, particularly if rates for delivered electricity increase substantially.AEP faces risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements that may impede their development and operating activities.  (Applies to all Registrants)AEP owns, develops, constructs, manages and operates electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities.  A key component of AEP's growth is its ability to construct and operate these facilities. As part of these operations AEP must periodically apply for licenses and permits from various local, state, federal and other regulatory authorities and abide by their respective conditions. Should AEP be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits on acceptable terms or resolving third-party challenges to such licenses or permits, should there be a delay in obtaining or renewing necessary licenses or permits or should regulatory authorities initiate any associated investigations or enforcement actions or impose related penalties or disallowances, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. Any failure to negotiate successful project development agreements for new facilities with third-parties could have similar results.Changes in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of electric utility facilities and franchises. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP primarily generates electricity at large central facilities and delivers that electricity to customers over its transmission and distribution facilities to customers usually situated within an exclusive franchise. This method results in economies of scale and generally lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells and microturbines, and distributed generation using either new or existing technology.  Other technologies, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), increase the efficiency of electricity and, as a result, lower the demand for it.   Changes in regulatory policies and advances in batteries or energy storage, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production and delivery.  These developments can challenge AEP’s competitive ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations, to establish fair regulatory mechanisms and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers.  Further, in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated, subsidized or encouraged through legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply, such resources could displace a higher marginal cost generating units, which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity.35AEP may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP’s business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks, including construction delays, non-performance by equipment and other third-party suppliers, and increases in equipment and labor costs.  To limit the risks of these construction projects, AEP’s subsidiaries enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits.  If any of these projects are canceled for any reason, including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits, significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur.  In addition, if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset, an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled.AEP is exposed to nuclear generation risk. (Applies to AEP and I&M)I&M owns the Cook Plant, which consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2,288 MWs, or about 7% of the generating capacity in the AEP System.  AEP and I&M are, therefore, subject to the risks of nuclear generation, which include the following:•The potential harmful effects on the environment and human health due to an adverse incident/event resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials such as SNF.•Limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations.•Uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts triggered by a loss event (federal law requires owners of nuclear units to purchase the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance and potentially contribute to the coverage for losses of others).•Uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives.There can be no assurance that I&M’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if these risks are triggered.The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities.  In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants.  In addition, although management has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at the Cook Plant, if an incident did occur, it could harm results of operations or financial condition.  A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.  Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S. could require AEP or I&M to make material contributory payments.Costs associated with the operation (including fuel), maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation, in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards, availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities.  Costs also may include replacement power, any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the Cook Plant (whether scheduled or premature), the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs.  The ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the Cook Plant is not assured.36AEP subsidiaries are exposed to risks through participation in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets that are beyond their control. (Applies to all Registrants)Results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets.  The rules governing the various RTOs, including SPP and PJM, may also change from time to time which could affect costs or revenues.  Existing, new or changed rules of these RTOs could result in significant additional fees and increased costs to participate in those structures, including the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to changes in transmission rate design.  In addition, these RTOs may assess costs resulting from improved transmission reliability, reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission rights.  As members of these RTOs, AEP’s subsidiaries are subject to certain additional risks, including the allocation among existing members, of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in these markets and resolution of complaint cases that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by members of these markets.AEP could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards. (Applies to all Registrants)Owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC and enforced by the FERC.  The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles.  Compliance with new reliability standards may subject AEP to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures.  While management expects to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates, there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner.  If AEP were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, AEP could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates.A substantial portion of the receivables of AEP Texas is concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect its cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.  (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)AEP Texas collects receivables from the distribution of electricity from REPs that supply the electricity it distributes to its customers.  As of December 31, 2020, AEP Texas did business with approximately 122 REPs.  Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for these services or could cause them to delay such payments.  AEP Texas depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis.  Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments.  Applicable PUCT regulations significantly limit the extent to which AEP Texas can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory, and AEP Texas thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort.  In 2020, AEP Texas’ three largest REPs accounted for 46% of its operating revenue.  Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.  If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made by creditors involving payments AEP Texas had received from such REP.Ohio House Bill 6 (HB 6), which provides for beneficial cost recovery for OPCo and for plants owned by OVEC, has come under public scrutiny. (Applies to AEP and OPCo)In 2019, Ohio adopted and implemented HB 6 which benefits OPCo by authorizing rate recovery for certain costs including renewable energy contracts, OVEC’s coal-fired generating units and energy efficiency measures. AEP and OPCo engaged in lobbying efforts and provided testimony during the legislative process in connection with HB 6.  In July 2020, an investigation led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office resulted in a federal grand jury indictment of an Ohio legislator and associates in connection with an alleged racketeering conspiracy involving the adoption of HB 376.  The outcome of the U.S. Attorney’s Office investigation and its impact on HB 6 is not known.  If the provisions of HB 6 were to be eliminated, it is unclear whether new legislation addressing similar issues would be adopted.  To the extent that OPCo is unable to recover the costs currently authorized by HB 6, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  In addition, the impact of continued public scrutiny of HB 6 is not known, and may have an adverse impact on AEP and OPCo, including their relationship with regulatory and legislative authorities, customers and other stakeholders.  AEP is a defendant in current litigation relating to HB6 and AEP or OPCo may be involved in future litigation.RISKS RELATED TO MARKET, ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL VOLATILITY AND OTHER RISKSAEP’s financial condition and results of operations could continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic. (Applies to all Registrants)The global 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic is an evolving situation that could lead to extended disruption of economic activity in AEP’s markets. COVID-19 could negatively affect AEP’s ability to operate its generating and transmission and distribution assets, its ability to access capital markets, and results of operations. AEP currently cannot estimate the potential impact to its financial position, results of operations and cash flows caused by COVID-19, which will depend on future developments and which are highly uncertain at this time. See Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview for additional information on COVID-19.AEP’s financial performance may be adversely affected if AEP is unable to successfully operate facilities or perform certain corporate functions. (Applies to all Registrants)Performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of generation, transmission and/or distribution facilities.  Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:•Operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes.•Operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements.•Labor disputes.•Compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards.•Information technology failure that impairs AEP’s information technology infrastructure or disrupts normal business operations.•Information technology failure that affects AEP’s ability to access customer information or causes loss of confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects AEP’s reputation or exposes AEP to legal claims.•Fuel or water supply interruptions caused by transportation constraints, adverse weather such as drought, non-performance by suppliers and other factors.•Catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, hurricanes, tornados, ice storms, terrorism (including cyber-terrorism), floods or other similar occurrences.•Fuel costs and related requirements triggered by financial stress in the coal industry.Physical attacks or hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information and damage AEP’s reputation. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP and its regulated utility businesses face physical security and cybersecurity risks as the owner-operators of generation, transmission and/or distribution facilities and as participants in commodities trading.  AEP and its regulated utility businesses own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems.  Further, the computer systems that run these facilities are not completely isolated from external networks.  Parties that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system or AEP operations could view these computer systems, software or networks as targets for cyber-attack.  In addition, the electric utility business requires the collection of sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss.38A security breach of AEP or its regulated utility businesses’ physical assets or information systems, interconnected entities in RTOs, or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet and/or reliability of the transmission and distribution system.  AEP and its regulated utility businesses could be subject to financial harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information, including sensitive customer, vendor, employee, trading or other confidential data.  A successful cyber-attack on the systems that control generation, transmission, distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing service to customers or collection of revenues.  The breach of certain business systems could affect the ability to correctly record, process and report financial information.  A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to AEP’s reputation.  In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring.  For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.If AEP is unable to access capital markets or insurance markets on reasonable terms, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP relies on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows; AEP also relies on access to insurance markets to assist in managing its risk and liability profile.  Volatility, increased interest rates and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect AEP’s ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to fund capital needs, including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness.  Certain sources of insurance and debt and equity capital have expressed increasing unwillingness to procure insurance for or to invest in companies, such as AEP, that rely on fossil fuels.  If sources of capital for AEP are reduced, capital costs could increase materially.  Restricted access to capital or insurance markets and/or increased borrowing costs or insurance premiums could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.Shareholder activism could cause AEP to incur significant expense, hinder execution of AEP’s business strategy and impact AEP’s stock price. (Applies to all Registrants)Shareholder activism, which can take many forms and arise in a variety of situations, could result in substantial costs and divert management’s and AEP’s board’s attention and resources from AEP’s business. Additionally, such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to AEP’s future, adversely affect AEP’s relationships with its employees, customers or service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, AEP may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters, including for third-party advisors.  AEP’s stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any shareholder activism.The announced phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect the costs and availability of financing. (Applies to all Registrants)A portion of the Registrants’ indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates, primarily based on the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) for deposits of U.S. dollars. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. Subsequently, on November 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve and the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom announced that LIBOR would be phased out completely by June 20, 2023 and replaced by the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR""). While this announcement extends the transition period to June 2023, the United States Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new U.S. dollar LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. However, because SOFR is a broad U.S. Treasury repo financing rate that represents overnight secured funding transactions, it differs fundamentally from U.S. dollar LIBOR. In addition, the overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Uncertainty as to the nature of such phase-out and alternative reference rates or disruption in the financial market could cause interest rates to increase. If sources of capital for the Registrants are reduced, capital costs could increase materially. Restricted access to capital markets and/or increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition and/or liquidity.39Downgrades in AEP’s credit ratings could negatively affect its ability to access capital. (Applies to all Registrants)The credit ratings agencies periodically review AEP’s capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings and cash flows.  Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to AEP and could limit access to funding for operations.  AEP’s business is capital intensive, and AEP is dependent upon the ability to access capital at rates and on terms management determines to be attractive.  If AEP’s ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained, AEP’s interest costs will likely increase and could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.AEP and AEPTCo have no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other payments due from their subsidiaries. (Applies to AEP and AEPTCo)AEP and AEPTCo are holding companies and have no operations of their own.  Their ability to meet their financial obligations associated with their indebtedness and to pay dividends is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of their operating subsidiaries, primarily their regulated utilities, and the ability of their subsidiaries to pay dividends to, or repay loans from them.  Their subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation (apart from loans from AEP or AEPTCo) to provide them with funds for their payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions or other payments.  Payments to AEP or AEPTCo by their subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations.  AEP and AEPTCo indebtedness and dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness.AEP’s operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions. (Applies to all Registrants)Electric power consumption is generally seasonal.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter.  As a result, overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis.  In addition, AEP has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder.  Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.  In addition, unusually extreme weather conditions could impact AEP’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable.Further, deteriorating economic conditions triggered by any cause, including international tariffs, generally result in reduced consumption by customers, particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely, while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues.  As a result, prevailing economic conditions may reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan costs and the costs of nuclear decommissioning.  (Applies to all Registrants and to AEP and I&M with respect to the costs of nuclear decommissioning)The costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan, changes in actuarial assumptions, future government regulation, changes in life expectancy, and the frequency and amount of AEP’s required or voluntary contributions made to the plans.  Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values, as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund the pension and other postretirement plans, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities, could increase pension and other postretirement expense, and AEP could be required from time to time to fund the pension plan with significant amounts of cash.  Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on liquidity by reducing cash flows and could negatively affect results of operations.  40Additionally, I&M holds a significant amount of assets in its nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy obligations to decommission its nuclear plant.  The rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the costs of decommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts.AEP’s results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers, or decline in customer demand. (Applies to all Registrants)Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities.  Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of AEP, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity.Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to further reduce energy consumption.  Additionally, technological advances or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.  Some or all of these factors, could impact the demand for electricity.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants)Certain events, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs.  The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development.  In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise.  Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business.  If AEP is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, future net income and cash flows may be reduced.Changes in the price of commodities, the cost of procuring fuel, emission allowances for criteria pollutants and the costs of transport may increase AEP’s cost of producing power, impacting financial performance. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of fuel (including the cost to procure coal and gas) and the price and availability to transport fuel.  AEP has existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of fuel, but as these contracts end or if they are not honored, AEP may not be able to purchase fuel on terms as favorable as the current contracts.  The inability to procure fuel at costs that are economical could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its useful life, and while AEP typically recovers expenditures for undepreciated plant balances, there can be no assurance in the future that AEP will recover such costs.  Similarly, AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances.  AEP uses emission allowances based on the amount of fuel used and reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures.  Based on current environmental programs remaining in effect, AEP has sufficient emission allowances to cover the majority of the projected needs for the next two years and beyond.  If the Federal EPA attempts to further reduce interstate transport, and it is acceptable by the courts, additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions.  If AEP needs to obtain allowances, those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs.  AEP’s risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge.Prices for coal, natural gas and emission allowances have shown material swings in the past.  Changes in the cost of fuel, emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.41In addition, actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value trading and marketing transactions, and those differences may be material.  As a result, as those transactions are marked-to-market, they may impact future results of operations and cash flows and impact financial condition.AEP is subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change. (Applies to all Registrants)Climate change creates physical and financial risk.  Physical risks from climate change may include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events, such as fires.  Customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity.  For residential customers, heating and cooling represent their largest energy use.  To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers’ energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes.Increased energy use due to weather changes may require AEP to invest in additional generating assets, transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load.  Decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect financial condition through decreased revenues.  Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stress, including service interruptions.  Weather conditions outside of the AEP service territory could also have an impact on revenues.  AEP buys and sells electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities.  Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on AEP’s own and/or other systems may raise electricity prices as AEP buys short-term energy to serve AEP’s own system, which would increase the cost of energy AEP provides to customers.Severe weather and weather-related events impact AEP’s service territories, primarily when thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, fires, floods and snow or ice storms occur.  To the extent the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and storms increase, AEP’s cost of providing service will increase, including the costs and the availability of procuring insurance related to such impacts, and these costs may not be recoverable.  Changes in precipitation resulting in droughts, water shortages or floods could adversely affect operations, principally the fossil fuel generating units.  A negative impact to water supplies due to long-term drought conditions or severe flooding could adversely impact AEP’s ability to provide electricity to customers, as well as increase the price they pay for energy.  AEP may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks.To the extent climate change impacts a region’s economic health, it may also impact revenues.  AEP’s financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies AEP serves.  The price of energy, as a factor in a region’s cost of living as well as an important input into the cost of goods and services, has an impact on the economic health of the communities within the AEP System.Management cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to AEP’s business activities. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP is involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising out of its business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 6 - Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies included in the 2020 Annual Report.  Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third-parties could interrupt the sales of transmission and distribution services.  (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)AEP Texas transmits and distributes electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third-parties.  If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate, sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.42Management is unable to predict the course, results or impact, if any, of current or future litigation or investigations relating to the extreme winter weather in Texas in February 2021.  (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas) As a result of the February 2021 severe winter weather in Texas which caused a shortage of electric generation, ERCOT instructed AEP Texas and other Texas electric utilities to initiate power outages to avoid a sustained large-scale outage and prevent long-term damage to the electric system.  At its peak, approximately 468,000 (44%) AEP Texas customers were without power.  In February 2021, a lawsuit was filed in Nueces, Texas County Court against AEP and AEP Texas alleging the failure to exercise reasonable care in maintaining and updating its generation, transmission and distribution facilities in order to prevent cold weather failures and other related negligence.  The complaint seeks monetary damages among other forms of relief. In February 2021, AEP Texas received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Office of the Attorney General of Texas requesting, among other data, information about its communications to and from ERCOT, PUCT, retail electric providers, utilities, or power generation companies, concerning power outages related to the February 2021 winter storm.  The company intends to respond to the Civil Investigative Demand.Management is unable to predict the course or outcome of these or any future litigation or investigations or their impact, if any, on future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Hazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission may result in suspension of AEP’s operations or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.  (Applies to all Registrants)AEP operations are subject to the usual hazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission, including explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, equipment interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other environmental risks.  The hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.  AEP maintains property and casualty insurance, but AEP is not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to AEP’s business, such as damage to poles, towers and lines or losses caused by outages.AEPTCo depends on its affiliates in the AEP System for a substantial portion of its revenues.  (Applies to AEPTCo)AEPTCo’s principal transmission service customers are its affiliates in the AEP System.  Management expects that these affiliates will continue to be AEPTCo’s principal transmission service customers for the foreseeable future.  For the year ended December 31, 2020, its affiliates were responsible for approximately 78% of the consolidated transmission revenues of AEPTCo.Most of the real property rights on which the assets of AEPTCo are situated result from affiliate license agreements and are dependent on the terms of the underlying easements and other rights of its affiliates.  (Applies to AEPTCo)AEPTCo does not hold title to the majority of real property on which its electric transmission assets are located.  Instead, under the provisions of certain affiliate contracts, it is permitted to occupy and maintain its facilities upon real property held by the respective AEP System utility affiliate that overlay its operations.  The ability of AEPTCo to continue to occupy such real property is dependent upon the terms of such affiliate contracts and upon the underlying real property rights of these utility affiliates, which may be encumbered by easements, mineral rights and other similar encumbrances that may affect the use of such real property.  AEP can give no assurance that (a) the 43relevant AEP System utility affiliates will continue to be affiliates of AEPTCo, (b) suitable replacement arrangements can be obtained in the event that the relevant AEP System utility affiliates are not its affiliates and (c) the underlying easements and other rights are sufficient to permit AEPTCo to operate its assets in a manner free from interruption.RISKS RELATED TO OWNING AND OPERATING GENERATION ASSETS AND SELLING POWERCosts of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)Operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety.  A majority of the electricity generated by the AEP System is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels.  Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury and particulates and the discharge and disposal of solid waste (including coal-combustion residuals or CCR) resulting from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations, controls and mitigation expenses.  Compliance with these legal requirements requires AEP to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees, disposal and permits at AEP facilities and could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.  Costs of compliance with environmental statutes and regulations could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition, especially if emission, CCR waste and/or discharge obligations are tightened, more extensive operating and/or permitting requirements are imposed or additional substances become regulated.  Although AEP typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies, replacement generation, undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers, there can be no assurance in the future that AEP will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants.  Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition. Regulation of CO2 emissions could materially increase costs to AEP and its customers or cause some electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)In 2014, the Federal EPA issued standards for new, modified and reconstructed units, and a guideline for the development of SIPs that would reduce carbon CO2 emissions from existing utility units (the Clean Power Plan). In 2019, the Federal EPA repealed the Clean Power Plan, and replaced it with new guidelines called the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule.  In January 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the ACE Rule and remanded it to the Federal EPA. The new administration has announced addressing climate change as a policy priority.  Costs of compliance with the environmental regulation of CO2 emissions, if any, could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition and/or could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life. Although AEP typically recovers environmental expenditures, there can be no assurance in the future that AEP can recover such costs which could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition.Courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims in the future may order AEP to pay damages or to limit or reduce emissions. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)In the past, there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which AEP, among others, were defendants.  In general, the actions allege that emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance.  The plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief.  If future actions are resolved against AEP, substantial modifications or retirement of AEP’s existing coal-fired power plants could be required, and AEP might be required to purchase power from third-parties to fulfill AEP’s commitments to supply power to AEP customers.  This could have a material impact on revenues.  In addition, AEP could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment, accelerate the timing of capital expenditures, pay damages or penalties and/or halt operations.  Unless recovered, those costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition.  Moreover, results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation.44Commodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not eliminated. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)AEP routinely has open trading positions in the market, within guidelines set by AEP, resulting from the management of AEP’s trading portfolio.  To the extent open trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish financial results and financial position.AEP’s power trading activities also expose AEP to risks of commodity price movements.  To the extent that AEP’s power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns, or controls, AEP would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices.In connection with these trading activities, AEP routinely enters into financial contracts, including futures and options, OTC options, financially-settled swaps and other derivative contracts.  These activities expose AEP to risks from price movements.  If the values of the financial contracts change in a manner AEP does not anticipate, it could harm financial position or reduce the financial contribution of trading operations.Parties with whom AEP has contracts may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm AEP’s results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP sells power from its generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis.  AEP also enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity, natural gas, emission allowances and coal as part of its power marketing and energy trading operations.  AEP is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe AEP money or the delivery of a commodity, including power, could breach their obligations.  Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, AEP may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at then-current market prices that may exceed AEP’s contractual prices, which would cause financial results to be diminished and AEP might incur losses.  Although estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty, actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict.AEP relies on electric transmission facilities that AEP does not own or control.  If these facilities do not provide AEP with adequate transmission capacity, AEP may not be able to deliver wholesale electric power to the purchasers of AEP’s power. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power AEP sells at wholesale.  This dependence exposes AEP to a variety of risks.  If transmission is disrupted, or transmission capacity is inadequate, AEP may not be able to sell and deliver AEP wholesale power.  If a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, AEP’s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited.  If restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure.The FERC has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales.  Although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions, access to transmission systems may not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable.  Management also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets.45OVEC may require additional liquidity and other capital support.  (Applies to AEP, APCo, I&M and OPCo) AEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies, including Energy Harbor (formerly FirstEnergy Solutions), a nonaffiliated party, own OVEC. The Inter-Company Power Agreement (ICPA) defines the rights and obligations and sets the power participation ratio of the parties to it. Under the ICPA, parties are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all OVEC capacity (approximately 2,400 MWs) in proportion to their respective power participation ratios. The aggregate power participation ratio of APCo, I&M and OPCo is 43.47%. If a party fails to make payments owed by it under the ICPA, OVEC may not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations, including its ongoing operating expenses as well as its indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, OVEC has outstanding indebtedness of approximately $1.3 billion, of which APCo, I&M, and OPCo are collectively responsible for $555 million through the ICPA. Although they are not an obligor or guarantor, APCo, I&M, and OPCo are responsible for their respective ratio of OVEC’s outstanding debt through the ICPA.The aggregate power participation ratio of Energy Harbor under the ICPA is 4.85%.  A portion of Energy Harbor’s revenues includes amounts authorized under HB 6.  The PUCO has rescinded its prior authorization of certain HB 6 related recovery for eligible entities including Energy Harbor.   If these amounts are not collected or if HB 6 is repealed and not replaced, Energy Harbor’s financial ability to participate in the ICPA could be adversely impacted. Management is currently unable to predict the outcome of the issues related to HB 6 and will continue to monitor the regulatory and legislative process and any potential impact to OVEC’s cash flows or financial condition. If OVEC does not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations, there is risk that APCo, I&M and/or OPCo may need to make payments in addition to their power participation ratio payments. Further, if OVEC’s indebtedness is accelerated for any reason, there is risk that APCo, I&M and/or OPCo may be required to pay some or all of such accelerated indebtedness in amounts equal to their aggregate power participation ratio of 43.47%"
5,AEP,AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER CO,2020-02-20,"ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORSGENERAL RISKS OF REGULATED OPERATIONSAEP may not be able to recover the costs of substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP’s business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits, construction of additional transmission facilities, modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives.  AEP’s public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions.  If these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates charged, affected AEP subsidiaries would not be able to recover the costs associated with their investments.  This would cause financial results to be diminished.Regulated electric revenues and earnings are dependent on federal and state regulation that may limit AEP’s ability to recover costs and other amounts. (Applies to all Registrants)The rates customers pay to AEP regulated utility businesses are subject to approval by the FERC and the respective state utility commissions of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.  In certain instances, AEP’s applicable regulated utility businesses may agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters that are subject to regulatory approval.  AEP cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of any settlements or the actions by the FERC or the respective state commissions in establishing rates.If regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the relevant commissions, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions, which may decrease future earnings.  Additionally, if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.  Similarly, if recovery or other rate relief authorized in the past is overturned or reversed on appeal, future earnings could be negatively impacted.  Any regulatory action or litigation outcome that triggers a reversal of a regulatory asset or deferred cost generally results in an impairment to the balance sheet and a charge to the income statement of the company involved.  See Note 4 – Rate Matters included in the 2019 Annual Report for additional information.  AEP’s transmission investment strategy and execution are dependent on federal and state regulatory policy. (Applies to all Registrants)A significant portion of AEP’s earnings is derived from transmission investments and activities.  FERC policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction.  If the FERC were to adopt a different policy, if states were to limit or restrict such policies, or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected, AEP’s strategy of investing in transmission could be impacted.  Management believes AEP’s experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives AEP an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install, construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities.  However, there can be no assurance that PJM, SPP, ERCOT or other RTOs will authorize new transmission projects or will award such projects to AEP.  Certain elements of AEP’s transmission formula rates have been challenged, which could result in lowered rates and/or refunds of amounts previously collected and thus have an adverse effect on AEP’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. (Applies to all Registrants other than AEP Texas)AEP provides transmission service under rates regulated by the FERC.  The FERC has approved the cost-based formula rate templates used by AEP to calculate its respective annual revenue requirements, but it has not expressly approved the amount of actual capital and operating expenditures to be used in the formula rates.  All aspects of AEP’s rates accepted or approved by the FERC, including the formula rate templates, the rates of return on the actual equity portion of its respective capital structures and the approved targeted capital structures, are subject to challenge by interested parties at the FERC, or by the FERC on its own initiative.  In addition, interested parties may challenge the annual 32implementation and calculation by AEP of its projected rates and formula rate true up pursuant to its approved formula rate templates under AEP’s formula rate implementation protocols.  If a challenger can establish that any of these aspects are unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, then the FERC can make appropriate prospective adjustments to them and/or disallow any of AEP’s inclusion of those aspects in the rate setting formula.AEP settled challenges to its SPP and PJM formula rates in proceedings at the FERC in 2019.  However, inquiries related to rates of return, as well as challenges to the formula rates of other utilities, are ongoing in other proceedings at the FERC.  The results of these proceedings could potentially negatively impact AEP in any future challenges to AEP’s formula rates.  If the FERC orders revenue reductions, including refunds, in any future cases related to its formula rates, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.End-use consumers and entities supplying electricity to end-use consumers may also attempt to influence government and/or regulators to change the rate setting methodologies that apply to AEP, particularly if rates for delivered electricity increase substantially.Changes in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of electric utility facilities and franchises. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP primarily generates electricity at large central facilities and delivers that electricity to customers over its transmission and distribution facilities to customers usually situated within an exclusive franchise. This method results in economies of scale and generally lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells and microturbines, and distributed generation using either new or existing technology.  Other technologies, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), increase the efficiency of electricity and, as a result, lower the demand for it.   Changes in regulatory policies and advances in batteries or energy storage, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production and delivery.  These developments can challenge AEP’s competitive ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations, to establish fair regulatory mechanisms and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers.  Further, in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated, subsidized or encouraged through legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply, such resources could displace a higher marginal cost generating units, which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity.  AEP may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP’s business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks, including construction delays, nonperformance by equipment and other third-party suppliers, and increases in equipment and labor costs.  To limit the risks of these construction projects, AEP’s subsidiaries enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits.  If any of these projects are canceled for any reason, including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits, significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur.  In addition, if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset, an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled.AEP is exposed to nuclear generation risk. (Applies to AEP and I&M)I&M owns the Cook Plant, which consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2,288 MWs, or about 7% of the generating capacity in the AEP System.  AEP and I&M are, therefore, subject to the risks of nuclear generation, which include the following:•The potential harmful effects on the environment and human health due to an adverse incident/event resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials such as SNF.33•Limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations.•Uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts triggered by a loss event (federal law requires owners of nuclear units to purchase the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance and potentially contribute to the coverage for losses of others).•Uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives.There can be no assurance that I&M’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if these risks are triggered.The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities.  In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants.  In addition, although management has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at the Cook Plant, if an incident did occur, it could harm results of operations or financial condition.  A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.  Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S. could require AEP or I&M to make material contributory payments.Costs associated with the operation (including fuel), maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation, in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards, availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities.  Costs also may include replacement power, any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the Cook Plant (whether scheduled or premature), the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs.  The ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the Cook Plant is not assured.AEP subsidiaries are exposed to risks through participation in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets that are beyond their control. (Applies to all Registrants)Results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets.  The rules governing the various RTOs, including SPP and PJM, may also change from time to time which could affect costs or revenues.  Existing, new or changed rules of these RTOs could result in significant additional fees and increased costs to participate in those structures, including the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to changes in transmission rate design.  In addition, these RTOs may assess costs resulting from improved transmission reliability, reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission rights.  As members of these RTOs, AEP’s subsidiaries are subject to certain additional risks, including the allocation among existing members, of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in these markets and resolution of complaint cases that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by members of these markets.AEP could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards. (Applies to all Registrants)Owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by the FERC.  The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles.  Compliance with new reliability standards may subject AEP to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures.  While management expects to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates, there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner.  If AEP were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, AEP could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates.34A substantial portion of the receivables of AEP Texas is concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect its cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.  (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)AEP Texas collects receivables from the distribution of electricity from REPs that supply the electricity it distributes to its customers.  As of December 31, 2019, AEP Texas did business with approximately 120 REPs.  Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for these services or could cause them to delay such payments.  AEP Texas depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis.  Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments.  Applicable PUCT regulations significantly limit the extent to which AEP Texas can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory, and AEP Texas thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort.  In 2019, AEP Texas’ first, second and third largest REPs accounted for 20%, 14% and 14%, respectively, of its operating revenue.  Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.  If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made by creditors involving payments AEP Texas had received from such REP.RISKS RELATED TO MARKET, ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL VOLATILITY AND OTHER RISKSAEP’s financial performance may be adversely affected if AEP is unable to successfully operate facilities or perform certain corporate functions. (Applies to all Registrants)Performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of generation, transmission and/or distribution facilities.  Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:•Operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes.•Operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements.•Labor disputes.•Compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards.•Information technology failure that impairs AEP’s information technology infrastructure or disrupts normal business operations.•Information technology failure that affects AEP’s ability to access customer information or causes loss of confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects AEP’s reputation or exposes AEP to legal claims.•Fuel or water supply interruptions caused by transportation constraints, adverse weather such as drought, non-performance by suppliers and other factors.•Catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, hurricanes, tornados, ice storms, terrorism (including cyber-terrorism), floods or other similar occurrences.•Fuel costs and related requirements triggered by financial stress in the coal industry.Physical attacks or hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information and damage AEP’s reputation. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP and its regulated utility businesses face physical security and cybersecurity risks as the owner-operators of generation, transmission and/or distribution facilities and as participants in commodities trading.  AEP and its regulated utility businesses own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems.  Further, the computer systems that run these facilities are not completely isolated from external networks.  Parties that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system or AEP operations could view these computer systems, software or networks as targets for cyber attack.  In addition, the electric utility business requires the collection of sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss.35A security breach of AEP or its regulated utility businesses’ physical assets or information systems, interconnected entities in RTOs, or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet and/or reliability of the transmission and distribution system or subject AEP and its regulated utility businesses to financial harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information, including sensitive customer, vendor, employee, trading or other confidential data.  A successful cyber attack on the systems that control generation, transmission, distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing service to customers or collection of revenues.  The breach of certain business systems could affect the ability to correctly record, process and report financial information.  A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to AEP’s reputation.  In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring.  For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.If AEP is unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP relies on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows.  Volatility, increased interest rates and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect AEP’s ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to fund capital needs, including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness.  Certain sources of debt and equity capital expressed increasing unwillingness to invest in companies, such as AEP, that rely on fossil fuels.  If sources of capital for AEP are reduced, capital costs could increase materially.  Restricted access to capital markets and/or increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.Shareholder activism could cause AEP to incur significant expense, hinder execution of AEP’s business strategy and impact AEP’s stock price. (Applies to all Registrants)Shareholder activism, which can take many forms and arise in a variety of situations, could result in substantial costs and divert management’s and AEP’s board’s attention and resources from AEP’s business. Additionally, such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to AEP’s future, adversely affect AEP’s relationships with its employees, customers or service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, AEP may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters, including for third-party advisors.  AEP’s stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any shareholder activism.The potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect the costs and availability of financing. (Applies to all Registrants)A portion of the Registrants’ indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates, primarily based on the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) for deposits of U.S. dollars.  LIBOR tends to fluctuate based on general interest rates, rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks, the supply of and demand for credit in the London interbank market and general economic conditions.  Accordingly, Registrants’ interest expense for any particular period will fluctuate based on LIBOR and other variable interest rates.  On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021.  It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021.  The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Funding Rate, which is calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities.  It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere.  To the extent these interest rates increase, interest expense will increase.  If sources of capital for the Registrants are reduced, capital costs could increase materially.  Restricted access to capital markets and/or increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition and/or liquidity. 36Downgrades in AEP’s credit ratings could negatively affect its ability to access capital. (Applies to all Registrants)The credit ratings agencies periodically review AEP’s capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings and cash flows.  Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to AEP and could limit access to funding for operations.  Recently a credit rating agency placed AEP’s credit rating on negative outlook primarily because a key criterion, the ratio of cash flow from operations (excluding working capital) to debt, is expected to decline due to higher capital spending and lower cash flows resulting from changes in tax law.  AEP’s business is capital intensive, and AEP is dependent upon the ability to access capital at rates and on terms management determines to be attractive.  If AEP’s ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained, AEP’s interest costs will likely increase and could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.AEP and AEPTCo have no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other payments due from their subsidiaries. (Applies to AEP and AEPTCo)AEP and AEPTCo are holding companies and have no operations of their own.  Their ability to meet their financial obligations associated with their indebtedness and to pay dividends is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of their operating subsidiaries, primarily their regulated utilities, and the ability of their subsidiaries to pay dividends to, or repay loans from them.  Their subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation (apart from loans from AEP or AEPTCo) to provide them with funds for their payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions or other payments.  Payments to AEP or AEPTCo by their subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations.  AEP and AEPTCo indebtedness and dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness.AEP’s operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions. (Applies to all Registrants)Electric power consumption is generally seasonal.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter.  As a result, overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis.  In addition, AEP has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder.  Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.  In addition, unusually extreme weather conditions could impact AEP’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable.Further, deteriorating economic conditions triggered by any cause, including international tariffs, generally result in reduced consumption by customers, particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely, while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues.  As a result, prevailing economic conditions may reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan costs and the costs of nuclear decommissioning.  (Applies to all Registrants and to AEP and I&M with respect to the costs of nuclear decommissioning)The costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan, changes in actuarial assumptions, future government regulation, changes in life expectancy, and the frequency and amount of AEP’s required or voluntary contributions made to the plans.  Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values, as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund the pension and other postretirement plans, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities, could increase pension and other postretirement expense, and AEP could be required from time to time to fund the pension plan with significant amounts of cash.  Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on liquidity by reducing cash flows and could negatively affect results of operations.  37Additionally, I&M holds a significant amount of assets in its nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy obligations to decommission its nuclear plant.  The rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the costs of decommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts.AEP’s results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers, or decline in customer demand. (Applies to all Registrants)Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities.  Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of AEP, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity.Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to further reduce energy consumption.  Additionally, technological advances or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.  Some or all of these factors, could impact the demand for electricity.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants)Certain events, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs.  The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development.  In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise.  Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business.  If AEP is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, future net income and cash flows may be reduced.Changes in the price of commodities, the cost of procuring fuel, emission allowances for criteria pollutants and the costs of transport may increase AEP’s cost of producing power, impacting financial performance. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of fuel (including the cost to procure coal and gas) and the price and availability to transport fuel.  AEP has existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of fuel, but as these contracts end or if they are not honored, AEP may not be able to purchase fuel on terms as favorable as the current contracts.  The inability to procure fuel at costs that are economical could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its useful life, and while AEP typically recovers expenditures for undepreciated plant balances, there can be no assurance in the future that AEP will recover such costs.  Similarly, AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances.  AEP uses emission allowances based on the amount of fuel used and reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures.  Based on current environmental programs remaining in effect, AEP has sufficient emission allowances to cover the majority of the projected needs for the next two years and beyond.  If the Federal EPA attempts to further reduce interstate transport, and it is acceptable by the courts, additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions.  If AEP needs to obtain allowances, those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs.  AEP’s risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge.Prices for coal, natural gas and emission allowances have shown material swings in the past.  Changes in the cost of fuel, emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.38In addition, actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value trading and marketing transactions, and those differences may be material.  As a result, as those transactions are marked-to-market, they may impact future results of operations and cash flows and impact financial condition.AEP is subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change. (Applies to all Registrants)Climate change creates physical and financial risk.  Physical risks from climate change may include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events, such as fires.  Customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity.  For residential customers, heating and cooling represent their largest energy use.  To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers’ energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes.Increased energy use due to weather changes may require AEP to invest in additional generating assets, transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load.  Decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect financial condition through decreased revenues.  Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stress, including service interruptions.  Weather conditions outside of the AEP service territory could also have an impact on revenues.  AEP buys and sells electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities.  Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on AEP’s own and/or other systems may raise electricity prices as AEP buys short-term energy to serve AEP’s own system, which would increase the cost of energy AEP provides to customers.Severe weather and weather-related events impact AEP’s service territories, primarily when thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, fires, floods and snow or ice storms occur.  To the extent the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and storms increase, AEP’s cost of providing service will increase, and these costs may not be recoverable.  Changes in precipitation resulting in droughts, water shortages or floods could adversely affect operations, principally the fossil fuel generating units.  A negative impact to water supplies due to long-term drought conditions or severe flooding could adversely impact AEP’s ability to provide electricity to customers, as well as increase the price they pay for energy.  AEP may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks.To the extent climate change impacts a region’s economic health, it may also impact revenues.  AEP’s financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies AEP serves.  The price of energy, as a factor in a region’s cost of living as well as an important input into the cost of goods and services, has an impact on the economic health of the communities within the AEP System.Management cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to AEP’s business activities. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP is involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising out of its business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 6 - Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies included in the 2019 Annual Report.  Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third-parties could interrupt the sales of transmission and distribution services.  (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)AEP Texas transmits and distributes electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third-parties.  If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate, sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.39Hazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission may result in suspension of AEP’s operations or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.  (Applies to all Registrants)AEP operations are subject to the usual hazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission, including explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, equipment interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other environmental risks.  The hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.  AEP maintains property and casualty insurance, but AEP is not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to AEP’s business, such as damage to poles, towers and lines or losses caused by outages.AEPTCo depends on its affiliates in the AEP System for a substantial portion of its revenues.  (Applies to AEPTCo)AEPTCo’s principal transmission service customers are its affiliates in the AEP System.  Management expects that these affiliates will continue to be AEPTCo’s principal transmission service customers for the foreseeable future.  For the year ended December 31, 2019, its affiliates were responsible for approximately 79% of the consolidated transmission revenues of AEPTCo.Most of the real property rights on which the assets of AEPTCo are situated result from affiliate license agreements and are dependent on the terms of the underlying easements and other rights of its affiliates.  (Applies to AEPTCo)AEPTCo does not hold title to the majority of real property on which its electric transmission assets are located.  Instead, under the provisions of certain affiliate contracts, it is permitted to occupy and maintain its facilities upon real property held by the respective AEP System utility affiliate that overlay its operations.  The ability of AEPTCo to continue to occupy such real property is dependent upon the terms of such affiliate contracts and upon the underlying real property rights of these utility affiliates, which may be encumbered by easements, mineral rights and other similar encumbrances that may affect the use of such real property.  AEP can give no assurance that (a) the relevant AEP System utility affiliates will continue to be affiliates of AEPTCo, (b) suitable replacement arrangements can be obtained in the event that the relevant AEP System utility affiliates are not its affiliates and (c) the underlying easements and other rights are sufficient to permit AEPTCo to operate its assets in a manner free from interruption.RISKS RELATED TO OWNING AND OPERATING GENERATION ASSETS AND SELLING POWERCosts of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)Operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety.  A majority of the electricity generated by the AEP System is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels.  Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury and particulates and the discharge and disposal of solid waste (including coal-combustion residuals or “CCR”) resulting from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations, controls and mitigation expenses.  Compliance with these legal requirements requires AEP to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees, disposal and permits at AEP facilities and could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.  Costs of compliance with environmental statutes and regulations could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition, especially if emission, CCR waste and/or discharge obligations are tightened, more extensive operating and/or permitting requirements are imposed or additional substances become regulated.  Although AEP typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies, replacement generation, undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers, there can be no assurance in the future that AEP will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants.  Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition. 40Regulation of CO2 emissions could materially increase costs to AEP and its customers or cause some electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)In 2014, the Federal EPA issued standards for new, modified and reconstructed units, and a guideline for the development of SIPs that would reduce carbon emissions from existing utility units. The standards and guidelines were finalized in 2015, and were challenged by several dozen states as well as industry groups and other stakeholders. The U.S. Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the guidelines for existing sources, known as the Clean Power Plan, while the courts considered those challenges. In 2017, the Federal EPA issued a proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan, and in 2018, the Federal EPA proposed new guidelines that would allow states to establish unit-specific performance standards based on their evaluation of past performance and whether certain efficiency improvement measures could be applied at existing coal-fired units. The Federal EPA also proposed to change the new source performance standard for new coal-fired utility units to 1,900 - 2,000 pounds per MWh depending on the size of the unit, an increase from the current standard of 1,400 pounds per MWh, based on its determination that carbon capture and storage is not available everywhere and is not sufficiently cost-effective to be considered the best available control technology for coal-fired units.  The new guidelines were finalized in 2019, and the Clean Power Plan was repealed.  Challenges to both of these actions are pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.CO2 standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs and could impact the dates for retirement of AEP’s coal-fired units.  While AEP typically recovers costs of complying with new requirements, such as the potential CO2 and other greenhouse gases emission standards from customers, there can be no assurance that AEP would recover such costs.Courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims in the future may order AEP to pay damages or to limit or reduce emissions. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)In the past, there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which AEP, among others, were defendants.  In general, the actions allege that emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance.  The plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief.  If future actions are resolved against AEP, substantial modifications or retirement of AEP’s existing coal-fired power plants could be required, and AEP might be required to purchase power from third-parties to fulfill AEP’s commitments to supply power to AEP customers.  This could have a material impact on revenues.  In addition, AEP could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment, accelerate the timing of capital expenditures, pay damages or penalties and/or halt operations.  Unless recovered, those costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition.  Moreover, results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation.Commodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not eliminated. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)AEP routinely has open trading positions in the market, within guidelines set by AEP, resulting from the management of AEP’s trading portfolio.  To the extent open trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish financial results and financial position.AEP’s power trading activities also expose AEP to risks of commodity price movements.  To the extent that AEP’s power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns, or controls, AEP would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices.In connection with these trading activities, AEP routinely enters into financial contracts, including futures and options, OTC options, financially-settled swaps and other derivative contracts.  These activities expose AEP to risks from price movements.  If the values of the financial contracts change in a manner AEP does not anticipate, it could harm financial position or reduce the financial contribution of trading operations.41Parties with whom AEP has contracts may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm AEP’s results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP sells power from its generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis.  AEP also enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity, natural gas, emission allowances and coal as part of its power marketing and energy trading operations.  AEP is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe AEP money or the delivery of a commodity, including power, could breach their obligations.  Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, AEP may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at then-current market prices that may exceed AEP’s contractual prices, which would cause financial results to be diminished and AEP might incur losses.  Although estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty, actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict.AEP relies on electric transmission facilities that AEP does not own or control.  If these facilities do not provide AEP with adequate transmission capacity, AEP may not be able to deliver wholesale electric power to the purchasers of AEP’s power. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power AEP sells at wholesale.  This dependence exposes AEP to a variety of risks.  If transmission is disrupted, or transmission capacity is inadequate, AEP may not be able to sell and deliver AEP wholesale power.  If a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, AEP’s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited.  If restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure.The FERC has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales.  Although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions, access to transmission systems may not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable.  Management also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets.OVEC may require additional liquidity and other capital support.  (Applies to AEP, APCo, I&M and OPCo) AEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies own OVEC.  The Inter-Company Power Agreement (ICPA) defines the rights and obligations and sets the power participation ratio of the parties to it.  Under the ICPA, parties are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all OVEC capacity (approximately 2,400 MWs) in proportion to their respective power participation ratios.  The aggregate power participation ratio of APCo, I&M and OPCo is 43.47%.  If a party fails to make payments owed by it under the ICPA, OVEC may not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations, including its ongoing operating expenses as well as its indebtedness.  As of December 31, 2019, OVEC has outstanding indebtedness of approximately $1.4 billion, of which APCo, I&M, and OPCo are collectively responsible for $589 million through the ICPA.  Although they are not an obligor or guarantor, APCo, I&M, and OPCo are responsible for their respective ratio of OVEC’s outstanding debt through the ICPA.FirstEnergy Solutions (“FES”), a nonaffiliated party, whose aggregate power participation ratio is 4.85% under the ICPA, has filed a petition seeking protection under bankruptcy law.  Litigation related to these filings continues.  In addition, as a result of these and prior related developments, OVEC’s credit ratings have been adversely impacted. If OVEC does not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations, there is risk that APCo, I&M and/or OPCo may need to make payments in addition to their power participation ratio payments.  Further, if OVEC’s indebtedness is accelerated for any reason, there is risk that APCo, I&M and/or OPCo may be required to pay some or all of such accelerated indebtedness in amounts equal to their aggregate power participation ratio of 43.47%.  Also, as a result of the credit rating agencies’ actions, OVEC’s ability to access capital markets on terms as favorable as previously may diminish and its financing costs will increase.42"
2,AEP,AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER CO,2019-02-21,"ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORSGENERAL RISKS OF REGULATED OPERATIONSAEP may not be able to recover the costs of substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP’s business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits, construction of additional transmission facilities, modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives.  AEP’s public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions.  If these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates charged, affected AEP subsidiaries would not be able to recover the costs associated with their investments.  This would cause financial results to be diminished.Regulated electric revenues and earnings are dependent on federal and state regulation that may limit AEP’s ability to recover costs and other amounts. (Applies to all Registrants)The rates customers pay to AEP regulated utility businesses are subject to approval by the FERC and the respective state utility commissions of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.  In certain instances, AEP’s applicable regulated utility businesses may agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters that are subject to regulatory approval.  AEP cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of any settlements or the actions by the FERC or the respective state commissions in establishing rates.If regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the relevant commissions, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions, which may decrease future earnings.  Additionally, if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.  Similarly, if recovery or other rate relief authorized in the past is overturned or reversed on appeal, future earnings could be negatively impacted.  Any regulatory action or litigation outcome that triggers a reversal of a regulatory asset or deferred cost generally results in an impairment to the balance sheet and a charge to the income statement of the company involved.  See Note 4 – Rate Matters included in the 2018 Annual Report for additional information.  AEP’s transmission investment strategy and execution are dependent on federal and state regulatory policy. (Applies to all Registrants)A significant portion of AEP’s earnings is derived from transmission investments and activities.  FERC policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction.  If the FERC were to adopt a different policy, if states were to limit or restrict such policies, or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected, AEP’s strategy of investing in transmission could be impacted.  Management believes AEP’s experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives AEP an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install, construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities.  However, there can be no assurance that PJM, SPP, ERCOT or other RTOs will authorize new transmission projects or will award such projects to AEP.  Certain elements of AEP’s transmission formula rates have been challenged, which could result in lowered rates and/or refunds of amounts previously collected and thus have an adverse effect on AEP’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. (Applies to all Registrants other than AEP Texas)AEP provides transmission service under rates regulated by the FERC.  The FERC has approved the cost-based formula rate templates used by AEP to calculate its respective annual revenue requirements, but it has not expressly approved the amount of actual capital and operating expenditures to be used in the formula rates.  All aspects of AEP’s rates accepted or approved by the FERC, including the formula rate templates, the rates of return on the actual equity portion of its respective capital structures and the approved targeted capital structures, are subject to challenge by interested parties at the FERC, or by the FERC on its own initiative.  In addition, interested parties may challenge the annual 32implementation and calculation by AEP of its projected rates and formula rate true up pursuant to its approved formula rate templates under AEP’s formula rate implementation protocols.  If a challenger can establish that any of these aspects are unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, then the FERC will make appropriate prospective adjustments to them and/or disallow any of AEP’s inclusion of those aspects in the rate setting formula.Parties have challenged AEP’s formula rates in proceedings at the FERC.  If the FERC orders revenue reductions as a result of these or other complaints, including refunds from the date of any complaint filing, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.End-use consumers and entities supplying electricity to end-use consumers may also attempt to influence government and/or regulators to change the rate setting methodologies that apply to AEP, particularly if rates for delivered electricity increase substantially.Changes in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of electric utility facilities and franchises. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP primarily generates electricity at large central facilities and delivers that electricity to customers over its transmission and distribution facilities to customers usually situated within an exclusive franchise. This method results in economies of scale and generally lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells and microturbines, and distributed generation using either new or existing technology.  Other technologies, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), increase the efficiency of electricity and, as a result, lower the demand for it.   Changes in regulatory policies and advances in batteries or energy storage, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production and delivery.  These developments can challenge AEP’s competitive ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations, to establish fair regulatory mechanisms and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers.  Further, in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated, subsidized or encouraged through legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply, such resources could displace a higher marginal cost generating units, which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity.  AEP may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP’s business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks, including construction delays, nonperformance by equipment and other third-party suppliers, and increases in equipment and labor costs.  To limit the risks of these construction projects, AEP’s subsidiaries enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits.  If any of these projects are canceled for any reason, including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits, significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur.  In addition, if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset, an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled.AEP is exposed to nuclear generation risk. (Applies to AEP and I&M)I&M owns the Cook Plant, which consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2,278 MWs, or about 7% of the generating capacity in the AEP System.  AEP and I&M are, therefore, subject to the risks of nuclear generation, which include the following:•The potential harmful effects on the environment and human health due to an adverse incident/event resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials such as SNF.•Limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations.33•Uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts triggered by a loss event (federal law requires owners of nuclear units to purchase the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance and potentially contribute to the coverage for losses of others).•Uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives.There can be no assurance that I&M’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if these risks are triggered.The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities.  In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants.  In addition, although management has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at the Cook Plant, if an incident did occur, it could harm results of operations or financial condition.  A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.  Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S. could require AEP or I&M to make material contributory payments.Costs associated with the operation (including fuel), maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation, in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards, availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities.  Costs also may include replacement power, any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the Cook Plant (whether scheduled or premature), the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs.  The ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the Cook Plant is not assured.AEP subsidiaries are exposed to risks through participation in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets that are beyond their control. (Applies to all Registrants)Results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets.  The rules governing the various RTOs, including SPP and PJM, may also change from time to time which could affect costs or revenues.  Existing, new or changed rules of these RTOs could result in significant additional fees and increased costs to participate in those structures, including the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to changes in transmission rate design.  In addition, these RTOs may assess costs resulting from improved transmission reliability, reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission rights.  As members of these RTOs, AEP’s subsidiaries are subject to certain additional risks, including the allocation among existing members, of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in these markets and resolution of complaint cases that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by members of these markets.AEP could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards. (Applies to all Registrants)Owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by the FERC.  The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles.  Compliance with new reliability standards may subject AEP to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures.  While management expects to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates, there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner.  If AEP were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, AEP could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates.34A substantial portion of the receivables of AEP Texas is concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect its cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.  (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)AEP Texas collects receivables from the distribution of electricity from REPs that supply the electricity it distributes to its customers.  As of December 31, 2018, AEP Texas did business with approximately 124 REPs.  Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for these services or could cause them to delay such payments.  AEP Texas depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis.  Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments.  Applicable PUCT regulations significantly limit the extent to which AEP Texas can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory, and AEP Texas thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort.  In 2018, AEP Texas’ first, second and third largest REPs accounted for 19%, 15% and 11%, respectively, of its operating revenue.  Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.  If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made by creditors involving payments AEP Texas had received from such REP.RISKS RELATED TO MARKET, ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL VOLATILITY AND OTHER RISKSAEP’s financial performance may be adversely affected if AEP is unable to successfully operate facilities or perform certain corporate functions. (Applies to all Registrants)Performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of generation, transmission and/or distribution facilities.  Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:•Operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes.•Operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements.•Labor disputes.•Compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards.•Information technology failure that impairs AEP’s information technology infrastructure or disrupts normal business operations.•Information technology failure that affects AEP’s ability to access customer information or causes loss of confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects AEP’s reputation or exposes AEP to legal claims.•Fuel or water supply interruptions caused by transportation constraints, adverse weather such as drought, non-performance by suppliers and other factors.•Catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, hurricanes, tornados, ice storms, terrorism (including cyber-terrorism), floods or other similar occurrences.•Fuel costs and related requirements triggered by financial stress in the coal industry.Physical attacks or hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information and damage AEP’s reputation. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP and its regulated utility businesses face physical security and cybersecurity risks as the owner-operators of generation, transmission and/or distribution facilities and as participants in commodities trading.  AEP and its regulated utility businesses own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems.  Further, the computer systems that run these facilities are not completely isolated from external networks.  Parties that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system or AEP operations could view these computer systems, software or networks as targets for cyber attack.  In addition, the electric utility business requires the collection of sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss.35A security breach of AEP or its regulated utility businesses’ physical assets or information systems, interconnected entities in RTOs, or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet and/or reliability of the transmission and distribution system or subject AEP and its regulated utility businesses to financial harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information, including sensitive customer, vendor, employee, trading or other confidential data.  A successful cyber attack on the systems that control generation, transmission, distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing service to customers or collection of revenues.  The breach of certain business systems could affect the ability to correctly record, process and report financial information.  A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to AEP’s reputation.  In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring.  For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.If AEP is unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP relies on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows.  Volatility, increased interest rates and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect AEP’s ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to fund capital needs, including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness.  Certain sources of debt and equity capital expressed increasing unwillingness to invest in companies, such as AEP, that rely on fossil fuels.  If sources of capital for AEP are reduced, capital costs could increase materially.  Restricted access to capital markets and/or increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.The potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect the costs and availability of financing. (Applies to all Registrants)A portion of the Registrants’ indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates, primarily based on the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) for deposits of U.S. dollars.  LIBOR tends to fluctuate based on general interest rates, rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks, the supply of and demand for credit in the London interbank market and general economic conditions.  AEP has not hedged its interest rate exposure with respect to its floating rate debt.  Accordingly, Registrants’ interest expense for any particular period will fluctuate based on LIBOR and other variable interest rates.  On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021.  It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021.  The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index, calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities.  It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere.  To the extent these interest rates increase, interest expense will increase.  If sources of capital for the Registrants are reduced, capital costs could increase materially.  Restricted access to capital markets and/or increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition and/or liquidity. Downgrades in AEP’s credit ratings could negatively affect its ability to access capital. (Applies to all Registrants)The credit ratings agencies periodically review AEP’s capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings and cash flows.  Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to AEP and could limit access to funding for operations.  AEP’s business is capital intensive, and AEP is dependent upon the ability to access capital at rates and on terms management determines to be attractive.  If AEP’s ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained, AEP’s interest costs will likely increase and could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.36AEP has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other payments due from its subsidiaries. (Applies to AEP)AEP is a holding company and has no operations of its own.  Its ability to meet its financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries, primarily its regulated utilities, and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to, or repay loans from, AEP.  Its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation (apart from loans from AEP) to provide AEP with funds for its payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions or other payments.  Payments to AEP by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations.  AEP indebtedness and common stock dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness.AEP’s operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions. (Applies to all Registrants)Electric power consumption is generally seasonal.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter.  As a result, overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis.  In addition, AEP has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder.  Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.  In addition, unusually extreme weather conditions could impact AEP’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable.Further, deteriorating economic conditions generally result in reduced consumption by customers, particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely, while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues.  As a result, prevailing economic conditions may reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan costs and the costs of nuclear decommissioning.  (Applies to all Registrants and to AEP and I&M with respect to the costs of nuclear decommissioning)The costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan, changes in actuarial assumptions, future government regulation, changes in life expectancy, and the frequency and amount of AEP’s required or voluntary contributions made to the plans.  Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values, as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund the pension and other postretirement plans, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities, could increase pension and other postretirement expense, and AEP could be required from time to time to fund the pension plan with significant amounts of cash.  Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on liquidity by reducing cash flows and could negatively affect results of operations.  Additionally, I&M holds a significant amount of assets in its nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy obligations to decommission its nuclear plant.  The rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the costs of decommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts.37AEP’s results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers, or decline in customer demand. (Applies to all Registrants)Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities.  Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of AEP, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity.Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to further reduce energy consumption.  Additionally, technological advances or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.  Some or all of these factors, could impact the demand for electricity.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants)Certain events, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs.  The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development.  In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise.  Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business.  If AEP is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, future net income and cash flows may be reduced.Changes in the price of commodities, emission allowances for criteria pollutants and the costs of transport may increase AEP’s cost of producing power, impacting financial performance. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of fuel (including coal and gas) and the price and availability to transport fuel.  AEP has existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of fuel, but as these contracts end or if they are not honored, AEP may not be able to purchase fuel on terms as favorable as the current contracts.  Similarly, AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances.  AEP uses emission allowances based on the amount of fuel used and reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures.  Based on current environmental programs remaining in effect, AEP has sufficient emission allowances to cover the majority of the projected needs for the next two years and beyond.  If the Federal EPA attempts to further reduce interstate transport, and it is acceptable by the courts, additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions.  If AEP needs to obtain allowances, those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs.  AEP’s risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge.Prices for coal, natural gas and emission allowances have shown material swings in the past.  Changes in the cost of fuel, emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.In addition, actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value trading and marketing transactions, and those differences may be material.  As a result, as those transactions are marked to market, they may impact future results of operations and cash flows and impact financial condition.38AEP is subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change. (Applies to all Registrants)Climate change creates physical and financial risk.  Physical risks from climate change may include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events, such as fires.  Customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity.  For residential customers, heating and cooling represent their largest energy use.  To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers’ energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes.Increased energy use due to weather changes may require AEP to invest in additional generating assets, transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load.  Decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect financial condition through decreased revenues.  Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stress, including service interruptions.  Weather conditions outside of the AEP service territory could also have an impact on revenues.  AEP buys and sells electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities.  Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on AEP’s own and/or other systems may raise electricity prices as AEP buys short-term energy to serve AEP’s own system, which would increase the cost of energy AEP provides to customers.Severe weather and weather-related events impact AEP’s service territories, primarily when thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, fires, floods and snow or ice storms occur.  To the extent the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and storms increase, AEP’s cost of providing service will increase, and these costs may not be recoverable.  Changes in precipitation resulting in droughts, water shortages or floods could adversely affect operations, principally the fossil fuel generating units.  A negative impact to water supplies due to long-term drought conditions or severe flooding could adversely impact AEP’s ability to provide electricity to customers, as well as increase the price they pay for energy.  AEP may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks.To the extent climate change impacts a region’s economic health, it may also impact revenues.  AEP’s financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies AEP serves.  The price of energy, as a factor in a region’s cost of living as well as an important input into the cost of goods and services, has an impact on the economic health of the communities within the AEP System.Management cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to AEP’s business activities. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP is involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising out of its business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 6 - Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies included in the 2018 Annual Report.  Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third-parties could interrupt the sales of transmission and distribution services.  (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)AEP Texas transmits and distributes electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third-parties.  If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate, sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.39Hazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission may result in suspension of AEP’s operations or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.  (Applies to all Registrants)AEP operations are subject to the usual hazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission, including explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, equipment interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other environmental risks.  The hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.  AEP maintains property and casualty insurance, but AEP is not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to AEP’s business, such as damage to poles, towers and lines or losses caused by outages.AEPTCo depends on its affiliates in the AEP System for a substantial portion of its revenues.  (Applies to AEPTCo)AEPTCo’s principal transmission service customers are its affiliates in the AEP System.  Management expects that these affiliates will continue to be AEPTCo’s principal transmission service customers for the foreseeable future.  For the year ended December 31, 2018, its affiliates were responsible for approximately 77% of the consolidated transmission revenues of AEPTCo.Most of the real property rights on which the assets of AEPTCo are situated result from affiliate license agreements and are dependent on the terms of the underlying easements and other rights of its affiliates.  (Applies to AEPTCo)AEPTCo does not hold title to the majority of real property on which its electric transmission assets are located.  Instead, under the provisions of certain affiliate contracts, it is permitted to occupy and maintain its facilities upon real property held by the respective AEP System utility affiliate that overlay its operations.  The ability of AEPTCo to continue to occupy such real property is dependent upon the terms of such affiliate contracts and upon the underlying real property rights of these utility affiliates, which may be encumbered by easements, mineral rights and other similar encumbrances that may affect the use of such real property.  AEP can give no assurance that (a) the relevant AEP System utility affiliates will continue to be affiliates of AEPTCo, (b) suitable replacement arrangements can be obtained in the event that the relevant AEP System utility affiliates are not its affiliates and (c) the underlying easements and other rights are sufficient to permit AEPTCo to operate its assets in a manner free from interruption.RISKS RELATED TO OWNING AND OPERATING GENERATION ASSETS AND SELLING POWERCosts of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)Operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety.  A majority of the electricity generated by the AEP System is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels.  Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury and particulates from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations, controls and mitigation expenses.  Compliance with these legal requirements requires AEP to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees and permits at all AEP facilities and could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.  Costs of compliance with environmental regulations could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition, especially if emission and/or discharge limits are tightened, more extensive permitting requirements are imposed or additional substances become regulated.  Although AEP typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies, replacement generation, undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers, there can be no assurance that AEP will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants.  Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition.  40Regulation of CO2 emissions could materially increase costs to AEP and its customers or cause some electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)In 2014, the Federal EPA issued standards for new, modified and reconstructed units, and a guideline for the development of SIPs that would reduce carbon emissions from existing utility units.  The standards and guidelines were finalized in 2015, and have been challenged by several dozen states as well as industry groups and other stakeholders.  The U.S. Supreme Court has stayed the implementation of the guidelines for existing sources, known as the Clean Power Plan, until a final decision is issued by the courts.  In 2017, the Federal EPA issued a proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan, and an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking information that should be considered in the development of new emission guidelines.   In 2018, the Federal EPA issued proposed guidelines that would allow states to establish unit-specific performance standards based on their evaluation of past performance and whether certain efficiency improvement measures could be applied at existing coal-fired units.  The Federal EPA also proposed to change the new source performance standard for new coal-fired utility units to 1,900 - 2,000 pounds per MWh depending on the size of the unit, an increase from the current standard of 1,400 pounds per MWh, based on its determination that carbon capture and storage is not available everywhere and is not sufficiently cost-effective to be considered the best available control technology for coal-fired units.CO2 standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs and could impact the dates for retirement of AEP’s coal-fired units.  While AEP typically recovers costs of complying with new requirements, such as the potential CO2 and other greenhouse gases emission standards from customers, there can be no assurance that AEP would recover such costs.Courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims in the future may order AEP to pay damages or to limit or reduce emissions. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)In the past, there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which AEP, among others, were defendants.  In general, the actions allege that emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance.  The plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief.  If future actions are resolved against AEP, substantial modifications of AEP’s existing coal-fired power plants could be required and AEP might be required to limit or reduce emissions.  Such remedies could require AEP to purchase power from third-parties to fulfill AEP’s commitments to supply power to AEP customers.  This could have a material impact on costs.  In addition, AEP could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment, accelerate the timing of capital expenditures, pay damages or penalties and/or halt operations.  Unless recovered, those costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition.  Moreover, results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation.Commodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not eliminated. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)AEP routinely has open trading positions in the market, within guidelines set by AEP, resulting from the management of AEP’s trading portfolio.  To the extent open trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish financial results and financial position.AEP’s power trading activities also expose AEP to risks of commodity price movements.  To the extent that AEP’s power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns, or controls, AEP would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices.In connection with these trading activities, AEP routinely enters into financial contracts, including futures and options, OTC options, financially-settled swaps and other derivative contracts.  These activities expose AEP to risks from price movements.  If the values of the financial contracts change in a manner AEP does not anticipate, it could harm financial position or reduce the financial contribution of trading operations.41Parties with whom AEP has contracts may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm AEP’s results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP sells power from its generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis.  AEP also enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity, natural gas, emission allowances and coal as part of its power marketing and energy trading operations.  AEP is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe AEP money or the delivery of a commodity, including power, could breach their obligations.  Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, AEP may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at then-current market prices that may exceed AEP’s contractual prices, which would cause financial results to be diminished and AEP might incur losses.  Although estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty, actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict.AEP relies on electric transmission facilities that AEP does not own or control.  If these facilities do not provide AEP with adequate transmission capacity, AEP may not be able to deliver wholesale electric power to the purchasers of AEP’s power. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power AEP sells at wholesale.  This dependence exposes AEP to a variety of risks.  If transmission is disrupted, or transmission capacity is inadequate, AEP may not be able to sell and deliver AEP wholesale power.  If a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, AEP’s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited.  If restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure.The FERC has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales.  Although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions, access to transmission systems may not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable.  Management also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets.OVEC may require additional liquidity and other capital support.  (Applies to AEP, APCo, I&M and OPCo) AEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies own OVEC.  The Inter-Company Power Agreement (ICPA) defines the rights and obligations and sets the power participation ratio of the parties to it.  Under the ICPA, parties are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all OVEC capacity (approximately 2,400 MWs) in proportion to their respective power participation ratios.  The aggregate power participation ratio of APCo, I&M and OPCo is 43.47%.  If a party fails to make payments owed by it under the ICPA, OVEC may not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations, including its ongoing operating expenses as well as its indebtedness.  As of December 31, 2018, OVEC has outstanding indebtedness of approximately $1.4 billion, of which APCo, I&M, and OPCo are collectively responsible for $604 million through the ICPA.  Although they are not an obligor or guarantor, APCo, I&M, and OPCo are responsible for their respective ratio of OVEC’s outstanding debt through the ICPA.FirstEnergy Solutions (“FES”), a nonaffiliated party, whose aggregate power participation ratio is 4.85% under the ICPA, has filed a petition seeking protection under bankruptcy law.  The bankruptcy court has granted the motion of FES to reject the ICPA.  Litigation related to these filings continues.  In addition, as a result of these and prior related developments, OVEC’s credit ratings have been adversely impacted. If OVEC does not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations, there is risk that APCo, I&M and/or OPCo may need to make payments in addition to their power participation ratio payments.  Further, if OVEC’s indebtedness is accelerated for any reason, there is risk that APCo, I&M and/or OPCo may be required to pay some or all of such accelerated indebtedness in amounts equal to their aggregate power participation ratio of 43.47%.  Also, as a result of the credit rating agencies’ actions, OVEC’s ability to access capital markets on terms as favorable as previously may diminish and its financing costs will increase.42"
3,AEP,AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER CO,2018-02-23,"ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORSGENERAL RISKS OF REGULATED OPERATIONSAEP may not be able to recover the costs of substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP’s business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits, construction of additional transmission facilities, modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives.  AEP’s public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions.  If these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates charged, affected AEP subsidiaries would not be able to recover the costs associated with their investments.  This would cause financial results to be diminished.Regulated electric revenues and earnings are dependent on federal and state regulation that may limit AEP’s ability to recover costs and other amounts. (Applies to all Registrants)The rates customers pay to AEP regulated utility businesses are subject to approval by the FERC and the respective state utility commissions of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.  In certain instances, AEP’s applicable regulated utility businesses may agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters that are subject to regulatory approval.  AEP cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of any settlements or the actions by the FERC or the respective state commissions in establishing rates.If regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the relevant commissions, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions, which may decrease future earnings.  Additionally, if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.  Similarly, if recovery or other rate relief authorized in the past is overturned or reversed on appeal, future earnings could be negatively impacted.  Any regulatory action or litigation outcome that triggers a reversal of a regulatory asset or deferred cost generally results in an impairment to the balance sheet and a charge to the income statement of the company involved.  For additional information, see Note 4 – Rate Matters and Note 12 – Income Taxes, of the notes to the financial statements, included in the 2017 Annual Reports.  AEP’s transmission investment strategy and execution are dependent on federal and state regulatory policy. (Applies to all Registrants)Management expects that a growing portion of AEP’s earnings in the future will be derived from transmission investments and activities.  FERC policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction.  If the FERC were to adopt a different policy, if states were to limit or restrict such policies, or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected, AEP’s strategy of investing in transmission could be impacted.  Management believes AEP’s experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives AEP an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install, construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities.  However, there can be no assurance that PJM, SPP or other RTOs will authorize new transmission projects or will award such projects to AEP.  Certain elements of AEP’s transmission formula rates have been challenged, which could result in lowered rates and/or refunds of amounts previously collected and thus have an adverse effect on AEP’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. (Applies to all Registrants other than AEP Texas)AEP provides transmission service under rates regulated by the FERC. The FERC has approved the cost-based formula rate templates used by AEP to calculate its respective annual revenue requirements, but it has not expressly approved the amount of actual capital and operating expenditures to be used in the formula rates. All aspects of AEP’s rates accepted or approved by the FERC, including the formula rate templates, the rates of return on the actual equity portion 33of its respective capital structures and the approved targeted capital structures, are subject to challenge by interested parties at the FERC, or by the FERC on its own initiative. In addition, interested parties may challenge the annual implementation and calculation by AEP of its projected rates and formula rate true up pursuant to its approved formula rate templates under AEP’s formula rate implementation protocols. If a challenger can establish that any of these aspects are unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, then the FERC will make appropriate prospective adjustments to them and/or disallow any of AEP’s inclusion of those aspects in the rate setting formula.In October 2016, several parties filed a complaint with the FERC claiming that the base ROE used by certain AEP subsidiaries that operate in PJM, including the East Transcos, in calculating formula transmission rates under the PJM OATT, is excessive and should be reduced from 10.99% to 8.32%, effective upon the date of the complaint. In June 2017, a similar complaint was filed with the FERC claiming that the base ROE used by certain AEP subsidiaries that operate in SPP, including the West Transcos, in calculating formula transmission rates under the SPP OATT is excessive and should be reduced from 10.7% to 8.36%, effective upon the date of the complaint. If the FERC orders revenue reductions as a result of the complaint, including refunds from the date of the complaint filing, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.End-use consumers and entities supplying electricity to end-use consumers may also attempt to influence government and/or regulators to change the rate setting methodologies that apply to AEP, particularly if rates for delivered electricity increase substantially.Recent changes in federal income tax policy may adversely affect cash flows, as well as credit ratings. (Applies to all Registrants)Recently enacted United States federal income tax legislation significantly changed the Internal Revenue Code, including taxation of corporations, by, among other things, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate, limiting interest deductions, and altering the expensing of capital expenditures. The legislation is unclear in certain respects and will require interpretations and implementing regulations by the Internal Revenue Service, as well as state income tax authorities, and the legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. In addition, the regulatory treatment of the impacts of this legislation will be subject to the discretion of the FERC and state public utility commissions.Although it is unclear when or how capital markets, credit rating agencies, the FERC or state public utility commissions may respond to this legislation, Management expects that certain financial metrics used by credit rating agencies, such as funds from operations-to-debt percentage, could be negatively impacted.  In addition, state public utility commissions have started to engage with AEP’s utility subsidiaries to determine how any tax savings will be returned to customers. Management expects that AEP’s utility subsidiaries will return the tax benefits to customers, either through decreasing rates, increasing the amortization of regulatory assets, accelerating depreciation or offsetting other rate increases. The amount and the timing of any payments of tax benefits to be returned to customers will ultimately be determined by the regulators.Management’s analysis and interpretation of this legislation is preliminary and ongoing.  Based on Management’s current evaluation, limitations on interest deductions are not expected to be significant. Any amendments to the legislation or interpretations or implementing regulations by the IRS contrary to Management’s interpretation of the legislation could limit the ability to deduct the interest on some of the Registrants’ outstanding debt.There may be other material adverse effects resulting from the legislation that have not yet been identified. If Management is unable to successfully take actions to manage any adverse impacts of the new tax legislation, or if additional interpretations, regulations, amendments or technical corrections exacerbate the adverse impacts of the legislation, the legislation could have an adverse effect on the Registrants’ financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and on the value of investments in debt securities and common stock. Any negative actions by credit rating agencies may make it more costly to issue future debt securities and could increase borrowing costs under existing credit facilities.  For additional information, see Note 4 - Rate Matters and Note 12 - Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.34Changes in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of electric utility facilities and franchises. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP primarily generates electricity at large central facilities and delivers that electricity to customers over its transmission and distribution facilities to customers usually situated within an exclusive franchise. This method results in economies of scale and generally lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells and microturbines, and distributed generation using either new or existing technology.  Other technologies, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), increase the efficiency of electricity and, as a result, lower the demand for it.   Changes in regulatory policies and advances in batteries or energy storage, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production and delivery.  The ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations, to establish fair regulatory mechanisms and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of AEP’s competitiveness.   Further, in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated, subsidized or encouraged through legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply, such resources could displace a higher marginal cost generating units, which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity.  AEP may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP’s business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks, including construction delays, nonperformance by equipment and other third party suppliers, and increases in equipment and labor costs.  To limit the risks of these construction projects, AEP’s subsidiaries enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits.  If any of these projects are canceled for any reason, including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits, significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur.  In addition, if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset, an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled.AEP is exposed to nuclear generation risk. (Applies to AEP and I&M)I&M owns the Cook Plant, which consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2,278 MWs, or about 7% of the generating capacity in the AEP System.  AEP and I&M are, therefore, subject to the risks of nuclear generation, which include the following:•The potential harmful effects on the environment and human health due to an adverse incident/event resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials such as spent nuclear fuel.•Limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations.•Uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts triggered by a loss event (federal law requires owners of nuclear units to purchase the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance and potentially contribute to the coverage for losses of others).•Uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives.•Uncertainties related to AEP’s reliance on a vendor for manufacturing nuclear fuel and for providing specialized engineering services and parts.There can be no assurance that I&M’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if these risks are triggered.35The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities.  In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants.  In addition, although management has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at the Cook Plant, if an incident did occur, it could harm results of operations or financial condition.  A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.  Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S. could require AEP or I&M to make material contributory payments.Costs associated with the operation (including fuel), maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation, in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards, availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities.  Costs also may include replacement power, any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the Cook Plant (whether scheduled or premature), the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs.  The ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the Cook Plant is not assured.Westinghouse and I&M have a number of significant ongoing contracts relating to reactor services, nuclear fuel fabrication, and ongoing engineering projects. The most significant of these relate to Cook Plant fuel fabrication. In March 2017, Westinghouse filed a petition to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. It intends to reorganize, not cease business operations. However, at the current stage of the bankruptcy process, it is unclear whether the company can successfully reorganize.  In January 2018, Westinghouse issued a news release stating that it intends to sell all of its global business, including the portion of the nuclear business that contracts with Cook Plant.  Any sale would require approval by the bankruptcy court.  In the unlikely event Westinghouse rejects I&M’s contracts, or there is an interference with the sale process, Cook Plant’s operations would be significantly impacted and potentially shut down temporarily as I&M seeks other vendors for these services.The different regional power markets in which AEP subsidiaries compete have changing market and transmission structures, which could affect performance in these regions. (Applies to all Registrants)Results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets.  The rules governing the various regional power markets, including SPP and PJM, may also change from time to time which could affect costs or revenues.  Because the manner in which RTOs will evolve remains unclear, management is unable to assess fully the impact that changes in these power markets may have on the business.AEP could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards. (Applies to all Registrants)As a result of EPACT, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by the FERC.  The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles.  Compliance with new reliability standards may subject AEP to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures.  While management expects to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates, there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner.  If AEP were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, AEP could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates.36A substantial portion of AEP’s receivables is concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect AEP’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.  (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)AEP Texas collects receivables from the distribution of electricity from REPs that supply the electricity it distributes to its customers. As of December 31, 2017, AEP Texas did business with approximately 124 REPs. Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for these services or could cause them to delay such payments. AEP Texas depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis. Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments. Applicable PUCT regulations significantly limit the extent to which AEP Texas can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory, and AEP Texas thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort. The PUCT enhanced the financial qualifications required of REPs that began selling power after January 1, 2009 and authorized utilities to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by REPs for recovery in a future rate case. In 2017, AEP Texas’ largest REP accounted for 18% of its operating revenue and its second largest REP accounted for 17% of its operating revenue. Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made by creditors involving payments AEP Texas had received from such REP.Actual capital investment in the State Transco’s may be lower than planned, which would cause a lower than anticipated rate base and would therefore result in lower revenues and earnings compared to management’s current expectations. (Applies to AEP and AEPTCo)Each of the State Transcos’ rate base, revenues and earnings are determined in part by additions to property, plant and equipment and when those additions are placed in service. AEPTCo anticipates making significant capital investments over the next several years; however, the amounts could change significantly due to factors beyond its control. If the State Transcos’ capital investment and the resulting in-service property, plant and equipment are lower than anticipated for any reason, the State Transcos will have a lower than anticipated rate base, thus causing their revenue requirements and future earnings to be lower than anticipated.Changes in energy laws, regulations or policies could impact AEP’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  (Applies to all Registrants)Each of the Registrant Subsidiaries is regulated by either the FERC as a “public utility” under federal law or the PUCT and is a transmission owner in ERCOT, PJM or SPP. AEP cannot predict whether the approved rate methodologies for any of the Registrant Subsidiaries will be changed. In addition, the U.S. Congress periodically considers enacting energy legislation that could assign new responsibilities to the FERC, modify existing law or provide the FERC or another entity with increased authority to regulate transmission matters. AEP cannot predict whether, and to what extent, the Registrant Subsidiaries may be affected by any such changes in federal energy laws, regulations or policies in the future. While the Registrant Subsidiaries are subject to the PUCT’s or FERC’s exclusive jurisdiction for purposes of rate regulation, changes in state laws affecting other matters, such as transmission siting and construction, could limit investment opportunities.37RISKS RELATED TO MARKET, ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL VOLATILITY AND OTHER RISKSAEP’s financial performance may be adversely affected if AEP is unable to successfully operate facilities or perform certain corporate functions. (Applies to all Registrants)Performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of generation, transmission and/or distribution facilities.  Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:•Operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes.•Operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements.•Labor disputes.•Compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards.•Information technology failure that impairs AEP’s information technology infrastructure or disrupts normal business operations.•Information technology failure that affects AEP’s ability to access customer information or causes loss of confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects AEP’s reputation or exposes AEP to legal claims.•Fuel or water supply interruptions caused by transportation constraints, adverse weather such as drought, non-performance by suppliers and other factors.•Catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, hurricanes, tornados, ice storms, terrorism (including cyber-terrorism), floods or other similar occurrences.•Fuel costs and related requirements triggered by financial stress in the coal industry.Physical attacks or hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information and damage AEP’s reputation. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP and its regulated utility businesses face physical security and cybersecurity risks as the owner-operators of generation, transmission and/or distribution facilities and as participants in commodities trading.  AEP and its regulated utility businesses own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems.  Further, the computer systems that run these facilities are not completely isolated from external networks. Parties that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system or AEP operations could view these computer systems, software or networks as targets for cyber attack.  In addition, the electric utility business requires the collection of sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss. A security breach of AEP or its regulated utility businesses’ physical assets or information systems, interconnected entities in RTOs, or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet and/or reliability of the transmission and distribution system or subject AEP and its regulated utility businesses to financial harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information, including sensitive customer, vendor, employee, trading or other confidential data.  A successful cyber attack on the systems that control generation, transmission, distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing service to customers or collection of revenues.  The breach of certain business systems could affect the ability to correctly record, process and report financial information.  A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to AEP’s reputation.  In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring.  For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.38In an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber intrusions, AEP has a comprehensive cyber security program designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and systems.  In addition, AEP is subject to mandatory cyber security regulatory requirements.  However, cyber threats continue to evolve and adapt, and, as a result, there is a risk that AEP could experience a successful cyber attack despite current security posture and regulatory compliance efforts.If AEP is unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP relies on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows.  Volatility and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect AEP’s ability to raise capital and fund capital needs, including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness.  Certain sources of debt and equity capital expressed increasing unwillingness to invest in companies, such as AEP, that rely on fossil fuels.  If sources of capital for AEP are reduced, capital costs could increase materially.  Restricted access to capital markets and/or increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.Downgrades in AEP’s credit ratings could negatively affect its ability to access capital. (Applies to all Registrants)The credit ratings agencies periodically review AEP’s capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings and  cash flows.  Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to AEP and could limit access to funding for operations.  AEP’s business is capital intensive, and AEP is dependent upon the ability to access capital at rates and on terms management determines to be attractive.  If AEP’s ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained, AEP’s interest costs will likely increase and could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.AEP has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other payments due from its subsidiaries. (Applies to AEP)AEP is a holding company and has no operations of its own.  Its ability to meet its financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries, primarily its regulated utilities, and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to, or repay loans from, AEP.  Its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation (apart from loans from AEP) to provide AEP with funds for its payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions or other payments.  Payments to AEP by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations.  AEP indebtedness and common stock dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness.AEP’s operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions. (Applies to all Registrants)Electric power generation is generally a seasonal business.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter.  As a result, overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis.  In addition, AEP has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder.  Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.  In addition, unusually extreme weather conditions could impact AEP’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable.Further, deteriorating economic conditions generally result in reduced consumption by customers, particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely, while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues.  As a result, prevailing economic conditions may reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.39Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan costs and the costs of nuclear decommissioning.  (Applies to all Registrants and to AEP and I&M with respect to the costs of nuclear decommissioning)The costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan, changes in actuarial assumptions, future government regulation, changes in life expectancy, and the frequency and amount of AEP’s required or voluntary contributions made to the plans.  Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values, as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund the pension and other postretirement plans, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities, could increase pension and other postretirement expense, and AEP could be required from time to time to fund the pension plan with significant amounts of cash.  Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on liquidity by reducing cash flows and could negatively affect results of operations.  Additionally, I&M holds a significant amount of assets in its nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy obligations to decommission its nuclear plant.  The rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the costs of decommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants)Certain events, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs.  The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development.  In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise.  Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business.  If AEP is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, future net income and cash flows may be reduced.Changes in the price of commodities, emission allowances for criteria pollutants and the costs of transport may increase AEP’s cost of producing power, impacting financial performance. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of fuel (including coal and gas) and the price and availability to transport fuel.  AEP has existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of fuel, but as these contracts end or if they are not honored, AEP may not be able to purchase fuel on terms as favorable as the current contracts.  Similarly, AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances.  AEP uses emission allowances based on the amount of coal used as fuel and the reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures.  As long as current environmental programs remain in effect, AEP has sufficient emission allowances to cover the majority of the projected needs for the next two years and beyond.  If the Federal EPA attempts to further reduce interstate transport, and it is acceptable by the courts, additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions.  If AEP needs to obtain allowances, those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs.  AEP’s risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge.Prices for coal, natural gas and emission allowances have shown material swings in the past.  Changes in the cost of fuel, emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.In addition, actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value trading and marketing transactions, and those differences may be material.  As a result, as those transactions are marked to market, they may impact future results of operations and cash flows and impact financial condition.40AEP is subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change. (Applies to all Registrants)Climate change creates physical and financial risk.  Physical risks from climate change may include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events.  Customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity.  For residential customers, heating and cooling represent their largest energy use.  To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers’ energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes.Increased energy use due to weather changes may require AEP to invest in additional generating assets, transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load.  Decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect financial condition through decreased revenues.  Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stress, including service interruptions.  Weather conditions outside of the AEP service territory could also have an impact on revenues.  AEP buys and sells electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities.  Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on AEP’s own and/or other systems may raise electricity prices as AEP buys short-term energy to serve AEP’s own system, which would increase the cost of energy AEP provides to customers.Severe weather impacts AEP’s service territories, primarily when thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods and snow or ice storms occur.  To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase AEP’s cost of providing service.  Changes in precipitation resulting in droughts, water shortages or floods could adversely affect operations, principally the fossil fuel generating units.  A negative impact to water supplies due to long-term drought conditions or severe flooding could adversely impact AEP’s ability to provide electricity to customers, as well as increase the price they pay for energy.  AEP may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks.To the extent climate change impacts a region’s economic health, it may also impact revenues.  AEP’s financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies AEP serves.  The price of energy, as a factor in a region’s cost of living as well as an important input into the cost of goods and services, has an impact on the economic health of the communities within the AEP System.Management cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to AEP’s business activities. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP is involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising out of its business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 6 of the Notes to Financial Statements entitled Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.  Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third parties could interrupt the sales of transmission and distribution services.  (Applies to AEP and AEP Texas)AEP Texas transmits and distributes electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties. If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate, sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.41Hazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission may result in suspension of AEP’s operations or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.  (Applies to all Registrants)AEP operations are subject to the usual hazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission, including explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, equipment interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other environmental risks. The hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. AEP maintains property and casualty insurance, but AEP is not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to AEP’s business, such as damage to poles, towers and lines or losses caused by outages.Management is considering strategic alternatives for a portion of interest in the Oklaunion Power Station and may incur losses as a result.  (Applies to AEP, AEP Texas and PSO)Management is evaluating strategic alternatives for the respective interests of AEP Texas and PSO in the Oklaunion Power Station.  AEPEP also has interest in the Oklaunion Power Station through its PPA with AEP Texas in which AEPEP receives the entire output of AEP Texas’ share of the Oklaunion Power Station through December 2027. Management has not made a decision regarding the potential alternatives, nor have they set a specific timeframe for a decision.  Certain of these alternatives could result in an impairment, a loss and/or could reduce future net income and cash flow and harm financial condition.AEPTCo depends on its affiliates in the AEP System for a substantial portion of its revenues.  (Applies to AEPTCo)AEPTCo’s principal transmission service customers are its affiliates in the AEP System. Management expects that these affiliates will continue to be AEPTCo’s principal transmission service customers for the foreseeable future. For the year ended December 31, 2017, its affiliates were responsible for approximately 80% of the consolidated transmission revenues of AEPTCo.Most of the real property rights on which the assets of AEPTCo are situated result from affiliate license agreements and are dependent on the terms of the underlying easements and other rights of its affiliates.  (Applies to AEPTCo)AEPTCo does not hold title to the majority of real property on which its electric transmission assets are located. Instead, under the provisions of certain affiliate contracts, it is permitted to occupy and maintain its facilities upon real property held by the respective AEP System utility affiliate that overlay its operations. The ability of AEPTCo to continue to occupy such real property is dependent upon the terms of such affiliate contracts and upon the underlying real property rights of these utility affiliates, which may be encumbered by easements, mineral rights and other similar encumbrances that may affect the use of such real property. AEP can give no assurance that (a) the relevant AEP System utility affiliates will continue to be affiliates of AEPTCo, (b) suitable replacement arrangements can be obtained in the event that the relevant AEP System utility affiliates are not its affiliates, and (c) the underlying easements and other rights are sufficient to permit AEPTCo to operate its assets in a manner free from interruption.RISKS RELATED TO OWNING AND OPERATING GENERATION ASSETS AND SELLING POWERCosts of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)Operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety.  A majority of the electricity generated by the AEP System is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels.  Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury and particulates from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations, controls and mitigation expenses.  Compliance with these legal requirements requires AEP to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees and permits at all AEP facilities and could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.  Costs of compliance 42with environmental regulations could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition, especially if emission and/or discharge limits are tightened, more extensive permitting requirements are imposed or additional substances become regulated.  Although AEP typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies, replacement generation, undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions, there can be no assurance that AEP will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants.  Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition.  Regulation of CO2 emissions could materially increase costs to AEP and its customers or cause some electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)In 2014, the Federal EPA issued standards for new, modified and reconstructed units, and a guideline for the development of state implementation plans that would reduce carbon emissions from existing utility units.  The standards and guidelines were finalized in 2015, and have been challenged by several dozen states as well as industry groups and other stakeholders.  The U.S. Supreme Court has stayed the implementation of the guidelines for existing sources, known as the Clean Power Plan, until a final decision is issued by the courts.  In 2017, the Federal EPA issued a proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan, and an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking information that should be considered in the development of new emission guidelines.CO2 standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs and could impact the dates for retirement of AEP’s coal-fired units.  AEP typically recovers costs of complying with new requirements such as the potential CO2 and other greenhouse gases emission standards from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions.Courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims in the future may order AEP to pay damages or to limit or reduce emissions. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)In the past, there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which AEP, among others, were defendants.  In general, the actions allege that emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance.  The plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief.  If future actions are resolved against AEP, substantial modifications of AEP’s existing coal-fired power plants could be required and AEP might be required to limit or reduce emissions.  Such remedies could require AEP to purchase power from third parties to fulfill AEP’s commitments to supply power to AEP customers.  This could have a material impact on costs.  In addition, AEP could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment, accelerate the timing of capital expenditures, pay damages or penalties and/or halt operations.  While management believes such costs should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business in AEP jurisdictions where generation rates are set on a cost of service basis, without such recovery, those costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition.  Moreover, results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation.AEP’s results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers, or decline in customer demand. (Applies to all Registrants)Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities.  Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of AEP, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity.43Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to further reduce energy consumption.  Additionally, technological advances or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.  Some or all of these factors, could impact the demand for electricity.Commodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not eliminated. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo)AEP routinely has open trading positions in the market, within guidelines set by AEP, resulting from the management of AEP’s trading portfolio.  To the extent open trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish financial results and financial position.AEP’s power trading activities also expose AEP to risks of commodity price movements.  To the extent that AEP’s power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns, or controls, AEP would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices.In connection with these trading activities, AEP routinely enters into financial contracts, including futures and options, over-the counter options, financially-settled swaps and other derivative contracts.  These activities expose AEP to risks from price movements.  If the values of the financial contracts change in a manner AEP does not anticipate, it could harm financial position or reduce the financial contribution of trading operations.Parties with whom AEP has contracts may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm AEP’s results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP sells power from its generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis.  AEP also enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity, natural gas, emission allowances and coal as  part of its power marketing and energy trading operations.  AEP is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe AEP money or the delivery of a commodity, including power, could breach their obligations.  Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, AEP may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at then-current market prices that may exceed AEP’s contractual prices, which would cause financial results to be diminished and AEP might incur losses.  Although estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty, actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict.AEP relies on electric transmission facilities that AEP does not own or control.  If these facilities do not provide AEP with adequate transmission capacity, AEP may not be able to deliver wholesale electric power to the purchasers of AEP’s power. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power AEP sells at wholesale.  This dependence exposes AEP to a variety of risks.  If transmission is disrupted, or transmission capacity is inadequate, AEP may not be able to sell and deliver AEP wholesale power.  If a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, AEP’s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited.  If restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure.The FERC has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales.  Although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions, access to transmission systems may not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable.  Management also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets.44OVEC may require additional liquidity and other capital support.  (Applies to AEP, APCo, I&M and OPCo) AEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies own OVEC. The Inter-Company Power Agreement (ICPA) defines the rights and obligations and sets the power participation ratio of the parties to it.  Under the ICPA, parties are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all OVEC capacity (approximately 2,400 MW) in proportion to their respective power participation ratios.  The aggregate power participation ratio of APCo, I&M and OPCo is 43.47%.  If a party fails to make payments owed by it under the ICPA, OVEC may not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations, including its ongoing operating expenses as well as its indebtedness.  OVEC has outstanding indebtedness of approximately $1.4 billion. In late 2016, a nonaffiliated party to the ICPA announced its intention to exit its merchant business and that it may pursue restructuring or bankruptcy.  This party’s aggregate power participation ratio is approximately 8% under the ICPA. Presently, this party has yet to pursue restructuring or bankruptcy.  However, as a result of this announcement and other related developments, Moody’s downgraded OVEC’s rating with a negative outlook for possible downgrade, while Fitch and S&P have revised OVEC’s outlook to negative. If OVEC does not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations, there is risk that APCo, I&M and/or OPCo may need to make payments in addition to their power participation ratio payments.  Further, if OVEC’s indebtedness is accelerated for any reason, there is risk that APCo, I&M and/or OPCo may be required to pay some or all of such accelerated indebtedness in amounts equal to their aggregate power participation ratio of 43.47%.  Also, as a result of the credit rating agencies’ actions, OVEC’s ability to access capital markets on terms as favorable as previously may diminish and its financing costs may rise"
8,AEP,AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER CO,2017-02-28,"ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORSIn addition to other disclosures within this report, including Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and other documents filed with the SEC from time to time, the following factors should be considered in evaluating the Registrants.  Such factors could affect actual results of operations and cause results to differ substantially from those currently expected or sought.  As indicated below, many of the following risk factors apply to AEP and several or all of the Registrant Subsidiaries and, accordingly, such risk factors should be read to include the applicable Registrants. GENERAL RISKS OF REGULATED OPERATIONS AND STATE RESTRUCTURINGAEP may not be able to recover the costs of substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP’s business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits, construction of additional transmission facilities, modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives.  AEP’s public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions.  If these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates charged, affected AEP subsidiaries would not be able to recover the costs associated with their planned extensive investment.  This would cause financial results to be diminished.Regulated electric revenues, earnings and results are dependent on federal and state regulation that may limit AEP’s ability to recover costs and other amounts. (Applies to all Registrants)The rates customers pay to AEP regulated utility businesses are subject to approval by the FERC and the respective state utility commissions of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.  In certain instances, AEP’s applicable regulated utility businesses may agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters that are subject to regulatory approval.  AEP cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of any settlements or the actions by the FERC or the respective state commissions in establishing rates.If regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the relevant commissions, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions, which may decrease future earnings.  Additionally, if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.  Similarly, if recovery or other rate relief authorized in the past is overturned or reversed on appeal, future earnings could be negatively impacted.  Any regulatory action or litigation outcome that triggers a reversal of a regulatory asset or deferred cost, including fuel and related costs, generally results in an impairment to the balance sheet and a charge to the income statement of the company involved.  See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements entitled Rate Matters for information regarding rate proceedings.AEP’s transmission investment strategy and execution bears certain risks associated with these activities. (Applies to all Registrants)Management expects that a growing portion of AEP’s earnings in the future will be derived from transmission investments and activities.  FERC policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction.  If FERC were to adopt a different policy, if states were to limit or restrict such policies, or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected, AEP’s strategy of investing in transmission could be impacted.  Management believes AEP’s experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives AEP an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install, construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities.  However, there can be no assurance that PJM, SPP or other RTOs will authorize new transmission projects or will award such projects to AEP.  35In October 2016, several parties filed a joint complaint with the FERC claiming that the base return on common equity used by various AEP affiliates in calculating formula transmission rates under the PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) is excessive and should be reduced from 10.99% to 8.32%, effective upon the date of the complaint.  If the FERC orders revenue reductions as a result of the complaint, including refunds from the date of the complaint filing, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.If the FERC were to lower the rate of return it has authorized for AEP’s transmission investments and facilities, or if one or more states were to successfully limit FERC jurisdiction on recovery of costs on transmission investment and its return, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.Changes in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of electric utility facilities and franchises. (Applies to all Registrants)           AEP primarily generates electricity at large central facilities and delivers that electricity to customers over its transmission and distribution facilities to customers usually situated within an exclusive franchise. This method results in economies of scale and generally lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells and microturbines, and distributed generation using either new or existing technology.  Other technologies, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), increase the efficiency of electricity and, as a result, lower the demand for it.   Changes in regulatory policies and advances in batteries or energy storage, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production and delivery.  The ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations, to establish fair regulatory mechanisms and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of AEP’s competitiveness.   Further, in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated, subsidized or encouraged through climate legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply, such resources could displace a higher marginal cost fossil plant, which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity. This occurrence could then reduce the market price at which all generators in that region would be able to sell their output and could adversely affect AEP’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, which could also result in an impairment of certain long-lived assets.  AEP may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP’s business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks, including construction delays, nonperformance by equipment and other third party suppliers, and increases in equipment and labor costs.  To limit the risks of these construction projects, AEP and its subsidiaries enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits.  If any of these projects are canceled for any reason, including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits, significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur.  In addition, if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset, an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled.36AEP is exposed to nuclear generation risk. (Applies to AEP and I&M)Through I&M, AEP owns the Cook Plant.  It consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2,191 MWs, or about 7% of the generating capacity in the AEP System.  AEP and I&M are, therefore, subject to the risks of nuclear generation, which include the following:•The potential harmful effects on the environment and human health due to an adverse incident/event resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials such as spent nuclear fuel.•Limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations.•Uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts triggered by a loss event (federal law requires owners of nuclear units to purchase the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance and potentially contribute to the coverage for losses of others).•Uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives.There can be no assurance that I&M’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if these risks are triggered.The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities.  In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants.  In addition, although management has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at the Cook Plant, if an incident did occur, it could harm results of operations or financial condition.  A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.  Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S. could require AEP or I&M to make material contributory payments.Costs associated with the operation (including fuel), maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation, in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards, availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities.  Costs also may include replacement power, any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the Cook Plant (whether scheduled or premature), the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs.  The ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the Cook Plant is not assured.The different regional power markets in which AEP subsidiaries compete or will compete in the future have changing market and transmission structures, which could affect performance in these regions. (Applies to all Registrants)Results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets.  The rules governing the various regional power markets, including SPP and PJM, may also change from time to time which could affect costs or revenues.  Because the manner in which RTOs will evolve remains unclear, management is unable to assess fully the impact that changes in these power markets may have on the business.AEP could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards. (Applies to all Registrants)As a result of EPACT, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by the FERC.  The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles.  Compliance with new reliability standards may subject AEP 37to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures.  While management expects to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates, there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner.  If AEP were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, AEP could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates.AEP may be negatively impacted by changes in federal income tax policy.  (Applies to all Registrants)AEP is impacted by the United States federal income tax policy, including corporate income tax laws. Both the new federal administration and the Republicans in the House of Representatives have made public statements in support of comprehensive tax reform, including significant changes to the United States corporate income tax laws. Management is currently unable to predict whether these reform discussions will result in any significant changes to existing tax laws, or if any such changes would have a cumulative positive or negative impact on AEP. A reduction in the federal statutory tax rate could result in an accelerated return of deferred federal income taxes to customers.  This and other changes in the United States federal income tax laws could have an adverse effect on cash flow, financial condition, and liquidity.Collection of revenues in Texas is concentrated in a limited number of REPs. (Applies to AEP)Revenues from the distribution of electricity in the ERCOT area of Texas are collected from REPs that supply the electricity AEP distributes to REP customers.  Currently, AEP does business with approximately one hundred REPs.  In 2016, AEP Texas’ largest REP accounted for 18% of its operating revenue, its second largest REP accounted for 18% of its operating revenue and its third largest REP accounted for 10% of its operating revenue.  Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the Texas market or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for services or cause them to delay such payments.  AEP depends on these REPs for timely remittance of payments.  Any delay or default in payment could reduce future cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO MARKET, ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL VOLATILITY AND OTHER RISKSAEP’s financial performance may be adversely affected if AEP is unable to successfully operate facilities or perform certain corporate functions. (Applies to all Registrants)Performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of generation, transmission and distribution facilities.  Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:•Operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes.•Operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements.•Labor disputes.•Compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards.•Information technology failure that impairs AEP’s information technology infrastructure or disrupts normal business operations.•Information technology failure that affects AEP’s ability to access customer information or causes loss of confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects AEP’s reputation or exposes AEP to legal claims.•Fuel or water supply interruptions caused by transportation constraints, adverse weather such as drought, non-performance by suppliers and other factors.•Catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, hurricanes, tornados, ice storms, terrorism (including cyber-terrorism), floods or other similar occurrences.•Fuel costs and related requirements triggered by financial stress in the coal industry.38Physical attacks or hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information and damage AEP’s reputation. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP and its regulated utility businesses face physical security and cybersecurity risks as the owner-operators of generation, transmission and distribution facilities and as participants in commodities trading.  AEP and its regulated utility businesses own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems.  Further, the computer systems that run these facilities are not completely isolated from external networks. Parties that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system or AEP operations could view these computer systems, software or networks as targets for cyber attack.  In addition, the electric utility business requires the collection of sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss. A security breach of AEP or its regulated utility businesses’ physical assets or information systems, AEP’s competitors, interconnected entities in RTOs and ISOs, or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet and/or reliability of the transmission and distribution system or subject AEP and its regulated utility businesses to financial harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information, including sensitive customer, vendor, employee, trading or other confidential data.  A successful cyber attack on the systems that control generation, transmission, distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing service to customers or collection of revenues.  The breach of certain business systems could affect the ability to correctly record, process and report financial information.  A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to AEP’s reputation.  In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring.  For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.In an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber intrusions, AEP has a comprehensive cyber security program designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and systems.  In addition, AEP is subject to mandatory cyber security regulatory requirements.  However, cyber threats continue to evolve and adapt, and, as a result, there is a risk that AEP could experience a successful cyber attack despite current security posture and regulatory compliance efforts.If AEP is unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP relies on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows.  Volatility and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect AEP’s ability to raise capital and fund capital needs, including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness.  Certain sources of debt and equity capital expressed increasing unwillingness to invest in companies, such as AEP, that rely on fossil fuels.  If sources of capital for AEP disappear, capital costs could increase materially.  Restricted access to capital markets and/or increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.Downgrades in AEP’s credit ratings could negatively affect its ability to access capital and/or to operate the power trading businesses. (Applies to all Registrants)The credit ratings agencies periodically review AEP’s capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings.  Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to AEP and could limit access to funding for operations.  AEP’s business is capital intensive, and AEP is dependent upon the ability to access capital at rates and on terms management determines to be attractive.  If AEP’s ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained, AEP’s interest costs will likely increase and could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.39AEP’s power trading business relies on the investment grade ratings of AEP’s individual public utility subsidiaries’ senior unsecured long-term debt or on the investment grade ratings of AEP.  Most counterparties require the creditworthiness of an investment grade entity to stand behind transactions.  If those ratings were to decline below investment grade, AEP’s ability to operate the power trading business profitably would be diminished because AEP would likely have to deposit cash or cash-related instruments which would reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.AEP has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other payments due from its subsidiaries. (Applies to AEP)AEP is a holding company and has no operations of its own.  Its ability to meet its financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries, primarily its regulated utilities, and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to, or repay loans from, AEP.  Its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation (apart from loans from AEP) to provide AEP with funds for its payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions or other payments.  Payments to AEP by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations.  AEP indebtedness and common stock dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness.AEP’s operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions. (Applies to all Registrants)Electric power generation is generally a seasonal business.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter.  As a result, overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the terms of power sale contracts that AEP enters into.  In addition, AEP has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder.  Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.  In addition, unusually extreme weather conditions could impact AEP’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable.Further, deteriorating economic conditions generally result in reduced consumption by customers, particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely, while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues.  As a result, prevailing economic conditions may reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan costs and the costs of nuclear decommissioning.  (Applies to all Registrants and to AEP and I&M with respect to the costs of nuclear decommissioning)The costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan, changes in actuarial assumptions, future government regulation, changes in life expectancy, and the frequency and amount of AEP’s required or voluntary contributions made to the plans.  Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values, as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund the pension and other postretirement plans, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities, could increase pension and other postretirement expense, and AEP could be required from time to time to fund the pension plan with significant amounts of cash.  Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on liquidity by reducing cash flows and could negatively affect results of operations.  Additionally, I&M holds a significant amount of assets in its nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy obligations to decommission its nuclear plant.  The rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the costs of decommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts.40Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants)Certain events, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs.  The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development.  In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise.  Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business.  If AEP is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, future net income and cash flows may be reduced.Changes in the price of commodities, emission allowances for criteria pollutants and the costs of transport may increase AEP’s cost of producing power or decrease the amount received from selling power, impacting financial performance. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal and the price and availability to transport coal.  AEP has existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of coal, but as these contracts end or if they are not honored, AEP may not be able to purchase coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts.  Similarly, AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances.  AEP uses emission allowances based on the amount of coal used as fuel and the reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures.  As long as current environmental programs remain in effect, AEP has sufficient emission allowances to cover the majority of the projected needs for the next two years and beyond.  If the Federal EPA attempts to further reduce interstate transport, and it is acceptable by the courts, additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions.  If AEP needs to obtain allowances, those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs.  AEP’s risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge.AEP also owns natural gas-fired facilities which exposes AEP to market prices of natural gas.  Historically, natural gas prices have tended to be more volatile than prices for other fuel sources.  Recently however, the availability of natural gas from shale production has lessened price volatility.   AEP’s ability to make sales at a profit is highly dependent on the price of natural gas.  As the price of natural gas falls, other market participants that utilize natural gas-fired generation will be able to offer electricity at increasingly competitive prices relative to AEP’s sales prices, so the margins realized from sales will be lower and, on occasion, AEP may need to curtail operation of marginal plants.  Management expects the availability of shale natural gas and issues related to its accessibility will have a long-term material effect on the price and volatility of natural gas.Prices for coal, natural gas and emission allowances have shown material swings in the past.  Changes in the cost of coal, emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.In addition, actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value trading and marketing transactions, and those differences may be material.  As a result, as those transactions are marked to market, they may impact future results of operations and cash flows and impact financial condition.AEP is subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change. (Applies to all Registrants)Climate change creates physical and financial risk.  Physical risks from climate change may include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events.  Customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity.  For residential customers, heating and cooling represent their largest energy use.  To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers’ energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes.41Increased energy use due to weather changes may require AEP to invest in additional generating assets, transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load.  Decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect financial condition through decreased revenues.  Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stress, including service interruptions.  Weather conditions outside of the AEP service territory could also have an impact on revenues.  AEP buys and sells electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities.  Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on AEP’s own and/or other systems may raise electricity prices as AEP buys short-term energy to serve AEP’s own system, which would increase the cost of energy AEP provides to customers.Severe weather impacts AEP’s service territories, primarily when thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods and snow or ice storms occur.  To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase AEP’s cost of providing service.  Changes in precipitation resulting in droughts, water shortages or floods could adversely affect operations, principally the fossil fuel generating units.  A negative impact to water supplies due to long-term drought conditions or severe flooding could adversely impact AEP’s ability to provide electricity to customers, as well as increase the price they pay for energy.  AEP may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks.To the extent climate change impacts a region’s economic health, it may also impact revenues.  AEP’s financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies AEP serves.  The price of energy, as a factor in a region’s cost of living as well as an important input into the cost of goods and services, has an impact on the economic health of the communities within the AEP System.Management cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to AEP’s business activities. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP is involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising out of its business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 6 of the Notes to Financial Statements entitled Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.  Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO OWNING AND OPERATING GENERATION ASSETS AND SELLING POWERCosts of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant. (Applies to all Registrants)Operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety.  Approximately 82% of the electricity generated by the AEP System is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels.  Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury and particulates from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations, controls and mitigation expenses.  Compliance with these legal requirements requires AEP to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees and permits at all AEP facilities and could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.  These expenditures have been significant in the past, and management expects that they will continue to be significant in order to comply with the current and proposed regulations.  Costs of compliance with environmental regulations could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition, especially if emission and/or discharge limits are tightened, more extensive permitting requirements are imposed or additional substances become regulated.  Although AEP typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies, replacement generation, undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions, there can be no assurance that AEP will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants.  Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition.  For AEP’s sales of energy from competitive units, there is no such cost-recovery mechanism.   As a result, AEP may not recover costs through the market and may be forced to shut competitive units down.  The costs of compliance for AEP’s competitive units could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition.42Regulation of CO2 emissions could materially increase costs to AEP and its customers or cause some electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain. (Applies to all Registrants)In 2014, the Federal EPA issued standards for new, modified and reconstructed units, and a guideline for the development of state implementation plans that would reduce carbon emissions from existing utility units.  The standards and guidelines were finalized in 2015, and have been challenged by several dozen states as well as industry groups and other stakeholders.  The U.S. Supreme Court has stayed the implementation of the guidelines for existing sources, known as the Clean Power Plan, until a final decision is issued by the courts.CO2 standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs and could impact the dates for retirement of AEP’s coal-fired units.  AEP typically recovers costs of complying with new requirements such as the potential CO2 and other greenhouse gases emission standards from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions.  For AEP’s sales of energy into the markets, however, there is no such recovery mechanism.  Failure to recover these costs, should they arise, could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition.Courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims in the future may order AEP to pay damages or to limit or reduce emissions. (Applies to all Registrants)In the past, there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which AEP, among others, were defendants.  In general, the actions allege that emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance.  The plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief.  If future actions are resolved against AEP, substantial modifications of AEP’s existing coal-fired power plants could be required and AEP might be required to limit or reduce emissions.  Such remedies could require AEP to purchase power from third parties to fulfill AEP’s commitments to supply power to AEP customers.  This could have a material impact on costs.  In addition, AEP could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment, accelerate the timing of capital expenditures, pay damages or penalties and/or halt operations.  While management believes such costs should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business in AEP jurisdictions where generation rates are set on a cost of service basis, without such recovery, those costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition.  Moreover, results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation.AEP’s results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers, or decline in customer demand or number of customers. (Applies to all Registrants)Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities.  Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of AEP, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity.Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to further reduce energy consumption.  Additionally, technological advances or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.  Some or all of these factors, could impact the demand for electricity.43Profitability is impacted by AEP’s continued authorization to sell power at market-based rates. (Applies to all Registrants)FERC has granted AGR, APCo, I&M, KPCo, OPCo, PSO and SWEPCo authority to sell electricity at market-based rates.  FERC reserves the right to revoke or revise this market-based rate authority if it subsequently determines that one or more of these companies can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions.  Each company that has obtained market-based rate authority from FERC must file a market power update every three years to show that they continue to meet FERC’s standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether entities qualify for market-based rates.  The loss of market-based rate authority by any of these entities, especially by AGR, could have a material adverse effect on results of operations.Revenues and results of operations from selling power are subject to market risks that are beyond AEP’s control. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP sells power from its generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis.  AEP also enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity, natural gas, emission allowances and coal as part of its power marketing and energy trading operations.  With respect to such transactions, the rate of return on capital investments is not determined through mandated rates, and revenues and results of operations are likely to depend, in large part, upon prevailing market prices for power in regional markets and competitive markets.  These market prices can fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time.  Sales margins may erode as markets mature and there may be diminished opportunities for gain should volatility decline.  In addition, the FERC, which has jurisdiction over wholesale power rates, as well as RTOs that oversee some of these markets, may impose price limitations, bidding rules and other mechanisms in these markets.  Power supply and other similar agreements entered into during extreme market conditions may subsequently be held to be unenforceable by a reviewing court or the FERC.  Fuel and emissions prices may also be volatile, and the price AEP can obtain for power sales may not change at the same rate as changes in fuel and/or emissions costs.  These factors could reduce margins and therefore diminish revenues and results of operations.  Volatility in market prices for fuel and power may result from:•Weather conditions, including storms.•Economic conditions.•Outages of major generation or transmission facilities.•Seasonality.•Power usage.•Illiquid markets.•Transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies.•Availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources.•Demand for energy commodities.•Natural gas, crude oil and refined products and coal production levels.•Natural disasters, wars, embargoes and other catastrophic events.•Federal, state and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation and/or incentives.•RTO market structures.Commodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not eliminated. (Applies to all Registrants)The exposure of AEP’s power trading activities is managed by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management procedures.  These risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate the risks associated with these activities.  As a result, management cannot predict the impact that AEP’s energy trading and risk management decisions may have on AEP’s business, operating results or financial position.AEP routinely has open trading positions in the market, within guidelines set by AEP, resulting from the management of AEP’s trading portfolio.  To the extent open trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish financial results and financial position.44AEP’s power trading risk management activities, including power sales agreements with counterparties, rely on projections that depend heavily on judgments and assumptions by management of factors such as the future market prices and demand for power and other energy-related commodities.  These factors become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future these estimates are made.  Even when policies and procedures are followed and decisions are made based on these estimates, results of operations may be impacted if the judgments and assumptions underlying those calculations prove to be inaccurate.AEP’s power trading activities also expose AEP to risks of commodity price movements.  To the extent that AEP’s power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns, or controls, AEP would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices.In connection with these trading activities, AEP routinely enters into financial contracts, including futures and options, over-the counter options, financially-settled swaps and other derivative contracts.  These activities expose AEP to risks from price movements.  If the values of the financial contracts change in a manner AEP does not anticipate, it could harm financial position or reduce the financial contribution of trading operations.Parties with whom AEP has contracts may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm AEP’s results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe AEP money or power could breach their obligations.  Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, AEP may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at then-current market prices that may exceed AEP’s contractual prices, which would cause financial results to be diminished and AEP might incur losses.  Although estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty, actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict.AEP relies on electric transmission facilities that AEP does not own or control.  If these facilities do not provide AEP with adequate transmission capacity, AEP may not be able to deliver wholesale electric power to the purchasers of AEP’s power. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power AEP sells at wholesale.  This dependence exposes AEP to a variety of risks.  If transmission is disrupted, or transmission capacity is inadequate, AEP may not be able to sell and deliver AEP wholesale power.  If a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, AEP’s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited.  If restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure.The FERC has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales.  Although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions, access to transmission systems may not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable.  Management also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets.OVEC may require additional liquidity and other capital support.  (Applies to AEP, APCo, I&M and OPCo) AEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies own OVEC. The Inter-Company Power Agreement (ICPA) defines the rights and obligations and sets the power participation ratio of the parties to it.  Under the ICPA, parties are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all OVEC capacity (approximately 2,400 MW) in proportion to their respective power participation ratios.  The aggregate power participation ratio of APCo, I&M and OPCo is 43.47%.  If a party fails to make payments owed by it under the ICPA, OVEC may not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations, including its ongoing operating expenses as well as its indebtedness.  OVEC has outstanding indebtedness of approximately $1.5 billion. 45Recently, a nonaffiliated party to the ICPA announced its intention to exit its merchant business and that it may pursue restructuring or bankruptcy.  This party’s aggregate power participation ratio is approximately 8% under the ICPA. As a result of this announcement and other related developments, Moody’s downgraded OVEC’s rating and left them on negative outlook for possible downgrade, Fitch revised OVEC’s outlook to negative, while S&P affirmed OVEC’s rating and stable outlook. If OVEC does not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations, there is risk that APCo, I&M and/or OPCo may need to make payments in addition to their power participation ratio payments.  Further, if OVEC’s indebtedness is accelerated for any reason, there is risk that APCo, I&M and/or OPCo may be required to pay some or all of such accelerated indebtedness in amounts equal to their aggregate power participation ratio of 43.47%.  Also, as a result of the Moody’s and Fitch actions, OVEC’s ability to access capital markets on terms as favorable as previously may diminish and its financing costs may rise"

Such factors could affect actual results of operations and cause results to differ substantially from those currently expected or sought.  As indicated below, many of the following risk factors apply to AEP and several or all of the Registrant Subsidiaries and, accordingly, such risk factors should be read to include the applicable Registrants. GENERAL RISKS OF REGULATED OPERATIONSAEP may not be able to recover the costs of substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP’s business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits, construction of additional transmission facilities, modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives.  AEP’s public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions.  If these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates charged, affected AEP subsidiaries would not be able to recover the costs associated with their planned extensive investment.  This would cause financial results to be diminished.Regulated electric revenues, earnings and results are dependent on state regulation that may limit AEP’s ability to recover costs and other amounts. (Applies to all Registrants)The rates customers pay to AEP regulated utility businesses are subject to approval by the FERC and the respective state utility commissions of Ohio, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, Oklahoma, Indiana, Louisiana, Kentucky, Arkansas, Michigan and Tennessee. If regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the relevant commissions, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions, which may decrease future earnings. Additionally, if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. Similarly, if recovery or other rate relief authorized in the past is overturned or reversed on appeal, future earnings could be negatively impacted. Any regulatory action or litigation outcome that triggers a reversal of a regulatory asset or deferred cost, including fuel and related costs, generally results in an impairment to the balance sheet and a charge to the income statement of the company involved.AEP’s transmission investment strategy and execution bears certain risks associated with these activities. (Applies to all Registrants)Management expects that a growing portion of AEP’s earnings in the future will be derived from the transmission investments and activities of AEPTCo and transmission joint ventures.  FERC policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction.  If FERC were to adopt a different policy, if states were to limit or restrict such policies, or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected, AEP’s strategy of investing in transmission could be impacted.  Management believes AEP’s experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives AEP an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install, construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities.  However, there can be no assurance that PJM, SPP or other RTOs will authorize new transmission projects or will award such projects to AEP.  If the FERC were to lower the rate of return it has authorized for AEP’s transmission investments and facilities, or if one or more states were to successfully limit FERC jurisdiction on recovery of costs on transmission investment and its return, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.33AEP may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP’s business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks, including construction delays, nonperformance by equipment and other third party suppliers, and increases in equipment and labor costs.  To limit the risks of these construction projects, AEP and its subsidiaries enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits.  If any of these projects are canceled for any reason, including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits, significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur.  In addition, if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset, an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled.AEP is exposed to nuclear generation risk. (Applies to AEP and I&M)Through I&M, AEP owns the Cook Plant.  It consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2,191 MW, or about 7% of the generating capacity in the AEP System.  AEP and I&M are, therefore, subject to the risks of nuclear generation, which include the following:•The potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials such as spent nuclear fuel.•Limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations.•Uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts triggered by a loss event (federal law requires owners of nuclear units to purchase the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance and potentially contribute to the losses of others).•Uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives.There can be no assurance that I&M’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if and when these risks are triggered.The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities.  In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants.  In addition, although management has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at the Cook Plant, if an incident did occur, it could harm results of operations or financial condition.  A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.  Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S. could require AEP or I&M to make material contributory payments.Costs associated with the operation (including fuel), maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation, in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards, availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities.  Costs also may include replacement power, any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the Cook Plant (whether scheduled or premature), the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs.  The ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the Cook Plant is not assured.34The different regional power markets in which AEP subsidiaries compete or will compete in the future have changing market and transmission structures, which could affect performance in these regions. (Applies to all Registrants)Results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets.  The rules governing the various regional power markets, including SPP and PJM, may also change from time to time which could affect costs or revenues.  Because the manner in which RTOs will evolve remains unclear, management is unable to assess fully the impact that changes in these power markets may have on the business.AEP could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards. (Applies to all Registrants)As a result of EPACT, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by the FERC.  The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles.  Compliance with new reliability standards may subject AEP to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures.  While management expects to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates, there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner.  If AEP were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, AEP could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates.RISKS RELATED TO MARKET, ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL VOLATILITY AND OTHER RISKSAEP’s financial performance may be adversely affected if AEP is unable to successfully operate facilities or perform certain corporate functions. (Applies to all Registrants)Performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of generation, transmission and distribution facilities.  Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:•Operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes.•Operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements.•Labor disputes.•Compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards.•Information technology failure that impairs AEP’s information technology infrastructure or disrupts normal business operations.•Information technology failure that affects AEP’s ability to access customer information or causes loss of confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects AEP’s reputation or exposes AEP to legal claims.•Fuel or water supply interruptions caused by transportation constraints, adverse weather such as drought, non-performance by suppliers and other factors.•Catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, hurricanes, tornados, ice storms, terrorism (including cyber-terrorism), floods or other similar occurrences.•Fuel costs and related requirements triggered by financial stress in the coal industry.Hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information and damage AEP’s reputation. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP owns assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems. Further, the computer systems that run AEP facilities are not completely isolated from external networks. Parties that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system or AEP operations could view AEP’s computer systems, software or networks as targets for cyber attack.  In addition, the business requires that AEP collect and maintain sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss.35A successful cyber attack on the systems that control generation, transmission, distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing service to customers or collection of revenues. The breach of certain business systems could affect the ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to AEP’s reputation. In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring.  For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.In an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber intrusions, AEP has a comprehensive cyber security program designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and systems. In addition, AEP is subject to mandatory cyber security regulatory requirements. However, cyber threats continue to evolve and adapt, and, as a result, there is a risk that AEP could experience a successful cyber attack despite current security posture and regulatory compliance efforts.If AEP is unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP relies on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows.  Volatility and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect AEP’s ability to raise capital and fund capital needs, including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness.  In addition, certain sources of debt and equity capital gave expressed increasing unwillingness to invest in companies, such as AEP, that rely on fossil fuels.  If sources of capital for AEP disappear, capital costs could increase materially.  Restricted access to capital markets and/or increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.Downgrades in AEP’s credit ratings could negatively affect its ability to access capital and/or to operate the power trading businesses. (Applies to all Registrants)The credit ratings agencies periodically review AEP’s capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings.  Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to AEP and could limit access to funding for operations.  AEP’s business is capital intensive, and AEP is dependent upon the ability to access capital at rates and on terms management determines to be attractive.  In periods of market turmoil, access to capital is difficult for all borrowers.  If AEP’s ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained, AEP’s interest costs will likely increase and could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.AEP’s power trading business relies on the investment grade ratings of AEP’s individual public utility subsidiaries’ senior unsecured long-term debt or on the investment grade ratings of AEP.  Most counterparties require the creditworthiness of an investment grade entity to stand behind transactions.  If those ratings were to decline below investment grade, AEP’s ability to operate the power trading business profitably would be diminished because AEP would likely have to deposit cash or cash-related instruments which would reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.AEP has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other obligations due it from its subsidiaries. (Applies to AEP)AEP is a holding company and has no operations of its own.  Its ability to meet its financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries, primarily its regulated utilities, and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to, or repay loans from, AEP.  Its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation (apart from loans from AEP) to provide AEP with funds for its payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions or other payments.  Payments to AEP by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations.  AEP indebtedness and common stock dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness.36AEP’s operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions. (Applies to all Registrants)Electric power generation is generally a seasonal business.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter.  As a result, overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the terms of power sale contracts that AEP enters into.  In addition, AEP has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder.  Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.  In addition, unusually extreme weather conditions could impact AEP’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable.Further, deteriorating economic conditions generally result in reduced consumption by customers, particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely, while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues.  As a result, prevailing economic conditions may reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants)Certain events, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs.  The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development.  In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise.  Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business.  If AEP is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, future net income and cash flows may be reduced.Changes in the price of commodities, emission allowances for criteria pollutants and the costs of transport may increase AEP’s cost of producing power or decrease the amount received from selling power, impacting financial performance. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal and the price and availability to transport coal.  AEP has existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of coal, but as these contracts end or if they are not honored, AEP may not be able to purchase coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts.  Similarly, AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances.  AEP uses emission allowances based on the amount of coal used as fuel and the reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures.  As long as current environmental programs remain in effect, AEP has sufficient emission allowances to cover the majority of the projected needs for the next two years and beyond.  If the Federal EPA is able to create a replacement rule to reduce interstate transport, and it is acceptable by the courts, additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions.  If AEP needs to obtain allowances under a replacement rule, those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs.  AEP’s risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge.AEP also owns natural gas-fired facilities which exposes AEP to market prices of natural gas.  Historically, natural gas prices have tended to be more volatile than prices for other fuel sources. Recently however, the availability of natural gas from shale production has lessened price volatility.  AEP’s ability to make sales at a profit is highly dependent on the price of natural gas.  As the price of natural gas falls, other market participants that utilize natural gas-fired generation will be able to offer electricity at increasingly competitive prices relative to AEP’s sales prices, so the margins realized from sales will be lower and, on occasion, AEP may need to curtail operation of marginal plants.  Management expects the availability of shale natural gas and issues related to its accessibility will have a long-term material effect on the price and volatility of natural gas.37Prices for coal, natural gas and emission allowances have shown material swings in the past.  Changes in the cost of coal, emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.In addition, actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value trading and marketing transactions, and those differences may be material.  As a result, as those transactions are marked to market, they may impact future results of operations and cash flows and impact financial condition.AEP is subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change. (Applies to all Registrants)Climate change creates physical and financial risk.  Physical risks from climate change may include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events.  Customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity.  For residential customers, heating and cooling represent their largest energy use.  To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers’ energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes.Increased energy use due to weather changes may require AEP to invest in additional generating assets, transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load.  Decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect financial condition through decreased revenues.  Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stress, including service interruptions.  Weather conditions outside of the AEP service territory could also have an impact on revenues.  AEP buys and sells electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities.  Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on AEP’s own and/or other systems may raise electricity prices as AEP buys short-term energy to serve AEP’s own system, which would increase the cost of energy AEP provides to customers.Severe weather impacts AEP’s service territories, primarily when thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods and snow or ice storms occur.  To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase AEP’s cost of providing service.  Changes in precipitation resulting in droughts, water shortages or floods could adversely affect operations, principally the fossil fuel generating units.  A negative impact to water supplies due to long-term drought conditions or severe flooding could adversely impact AEP’s ability to provide electricity to customers, as well as increase the price they pay for energy.  AEP may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks.To the extent climate change impacts a region’s economic health, it may also impact revenues.  AEP’s financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies AEP serves.  The price of energy, as a factor in a region’s cost of living as well as an important input into the cost of goods and services, has an impact on the economic health of the communities within the AEP System.Management cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to AEP’s business activities. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP is involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising out of its business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 6 of the Notes to Financial Statements entitled Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.  Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.38RISKS RELATING TO STATE RESTRUCTURINGCollection of revenues in Texas is concentrated in a limited number of REPs. (Applies to AEP)Revenues from the distribution of electricity in the ERCOT area of Texas are collected from REPs that supply the electricity AEP distributes to REP customers.  Currently, AEP does business with approximately one hundred REPs.  In 2015, TCC’s largest REP accounted for 23% of its operating revenue and its second largest REP accounted for 22% of its operating revenue; TNC’s largest REP accounted for 11% of its operating revenues, and its second largest REP accounted for 10% of its operating revenues.  Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the Texas market or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for services or cause them to delay such payments.  AEP depends on these REPs for timely remittance of payments.  Any delay or default in payment could reduce future cash flows and negatively impact financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO OWNING AND OPERATING GENERATION ASSETS AND SELLING POWERCosts of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant. (Applies to all Registrants)Operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety.  Approximately 90% of the electricity generated by the AEP System is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels.  Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury and particulates from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations, controls and mitigation expenses.  Compliance with these legal requirements requires AEP to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees and permits at all AEP facilities and could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.  These expenditures have been significant in the past, and management expects that they will continue to be significant in order to comply with the current and proposed regulations.  Costs of compliance with environmental regulations could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition, especially if emission and/or discharge limits are tightened, more extensive permitting requirements are imposed or additional substances become regulated.  If AEP retires generation plants prior to the end of their estimated useful life, there can be no assurance that AEP will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants.  AEP typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies, replacement generation, undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions.  Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition.   For AEP’s merchant generation units, there is no such cost-recovery mechanism.   As a result, AEP may not recover costs through the market and may be forced to shut competitive units down.  The costs of compliance for AEP’s competitive units could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition.Regulation of CO2 emissions could materially increase costs to AEP and its customers or cause some electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain. (Applies to all Registrants)In 2015, the Federal EPA issued final CO2 emissions standards for new power generation sources, and final emission guidelines for existing fossil fuel fired electric generating units.  The standards for new coal-fired generating units are based on the use of partial carbon capture and storage.  The standards for natural gas combined cycle units are based on the use of efficient combined cycle generating technology. The Clean Power Plan guidelines for existing sources include aggressive emission rate goals that are composed of a number of measures and seek nationwide reductions of CO2 emissions of approximately 32% from 2005 levels by 2030.  The Clean Power Plan is intended to be implemented pursuant to individual state plans beginning in 2022.  In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay on the final Clean Power Plan, including all of the deadlines for submission of initial or final state plans.  The stay will remain in effect until a final decision is issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court considers any petition for review. All of the final requirements are currently the subject of litigation in the federal courts.39CO2 standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs and could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.  If AEP retires generation plants prior to the end of their estimated useful life, there can be no assurance that AEP will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants.  AEP typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies, replacement generation, undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions.  Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition.   For AEP’s merchant generation units, there is no such cost-recovery mechanism.   As a result, AEP may not recover costs through the market and may be forced to shut competitive units down.  The costs of compliance for AEP’s competitive units could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition.AEP’s financial performance  may be adversely affected if the merchant generation fleet is not profitable or loses value. (Applies to AEP)Management is evaluating strategic alternatives for AEP’s merchant generation fleet, which primarily includes AGR’s generation fleet which operates in PJM.  Management has not made a decision regarding the potential alternatives, nor have they set a specific timeframe for a decision.  Certain of these alternatives could result in a loss which could reduce future net income and cash flow and harm financial condition.Amounts AEP receives from the results of PJM capacity auctions associated with nonregulated generation assets could fail to adequately compensate AEP. (Applies to AEP)Financial returns on AGR’s generation capacity are subject to the results of annual PJM capacity auctions.  Auction results indicate a great deal of volatility and the possibility of clearing prices substantially lower than the cost of such capacity.  If the PJM capacity auctions result in clearing prices lower than the cost of AEP’s capacity, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition.Courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims in the future may order AEP to pay damages or to limit or reduce emissions. (Applies to all Registrants)In the past, there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which AEP, among others, were defendants.  In general, the actions allege that emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance.  The plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief.  If future actions are resolved against AEP, substantial modifications of AEP’s existing coal-fired power plants could be required and AEP might be required to limit or reduce emissions.  Such remedies could require AEP to purchase power from third parties to fulfill AEP’s commitments to supply power to AEP customers.  This could have a material impact on costs.  In addition, AEP could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment, accelerate the timing of capital expenditures, pay damages or penalties and/or halt operations.  While management believes such costs should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business in AEP jurisdictions where generation rates are set on a cost of service basis, without such recovery, those costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition.  Moreover, results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation.Changes in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of generating facilities. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP primarily generates electricity at large central facilities.  This method results in economies of scale and generally lower costs than (a) newer technologies such as fuel cells and microturbines, and (b) distributed generation using either new or existing technology.  Other technologies, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), increase the efficiency of electricity and, as a result, lower the demand for it.  Changes in regulatory policies and advances in batteries or energy storage, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production.  The ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of AEP’s competitiveness.  The costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive.  It is possible that advances in technologies, the availability of distributed generation or changes in 40regulatory policies will lower the demand for electricity or reduce the costs of new technology to levels that are equal to or below that of most central station electricity production, either of which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations.Further, in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated, subsidized or encouraged through climate legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply, such resources could displace a higher marginal cost fossil plant, which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity. This occurrence could then reduce the market price at which all generators in that region would be able to sell their output. These events could adversely affect AEP’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and could also result in an impairment of certain long-lived assets.Profitability is impacted by AEP’s continued authorization to sell power at market-based rates. (Applies to all Registrants)FERC has granted AGR, APCo, I&M, KPCo, OPCo, PSO and SWEPCo authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. FERC reserves the right to revoke or revise this market-based rate authority if it subsequently determines that one or more of these companies can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions.  Each company that has obtained market-based rate authority from FERC must file a market power update every three years to show that they continue to meet FERC’s standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether entities qualify for market-based rates.  The loss of market-based rate authority by any of these entities, especially by AGR, could have a material adverse effect on results of operations.Revenues and results of operations from selling power are subject to market risks that are beyond AEP’s control. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP sells power from its generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis.  AEP also enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity, natural gas, emission allowances and coal as part of its power marketing and energy trading operations.  With respect to such transactions, the rate of return on capital investments is not determined through mandated rates, and revenues and results of operations are likely to depend, in large part, upon prevailing market prices for power in regional markets and competitive markets.  These market prices can fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time.  Sales margins may erode as markets mature and there may be diminished opportunities for gain should volatility decline.  In addition, the FERC, which has jurisdiction over wholesale power rates, as well as RTOs that oversee some of these markets, may impose price limitations, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets.  Power supply and other similar agreements entered into during extreme market conditions may subsequently be held to be unenforceable by a reviewing court or the FERC.  Fuel and emissions prices may also be volatile, and the price AEP can obtain for power sales may not change at the same rate as changes in fuel and/or emissions costs.  These factors could reduce margins and therefore diminish revenues and results of operations.  Volatility in market prices for fuel and power may result from:•Weather conditions, including storms.•Economic conditions.•Outages of major generation or transmission facilities.•Seasonality.•Power usage.•Illiquid markets.•Transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies.•Availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources.•Demand for energy commodities.•Natural gas, crude oil and refined products and coal production levels.•Natural disasters, wars, embargoes and other catastrophic events.•Federal, state and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation and/or incentives.•RTO market structures.41Commodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not eliminated. (Applies to all Registrants)The exposure of AEP’s power trading activities is managed by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management procedures.  These risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate the risks associated with these activities.  As a result, management cannot predict the impact that AEP’s energy trading and risk management decisions may have on AEP’s business, operating results or financial position.AEP routinely has open trading positions in the market, within guidelines set by AEP, resulting from the management of AEP’s trading portfolio.  To the extent open trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish financial results and financial position.AEP’s power trading risk management activities, including power sales agreements with counterparties, rely on projections that depend heavily on judgments and assumptions by management of factors such as the future market prices and demand for power and other energy-related commodities.  These factors become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future these estimates are made.  Even when policies and procedures are followed and decisions are made based on these estimates, results of operations may be impacted if the judgments and assumptions underlying those calculations prove to be inaccurate.AEP’s power trading activities also expose AEP to risks of commodity price movements.  To the extent that AEP’s power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns, or controls, through long-term power purchase agreements, AEP would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices.In connection with these trading activities, AEP routinely enters into financial contracts, including futures and options, over-the counter options, financially-settled swaps and other derivative contracts.  These activities expose AEP to risks from price movements.  If the values of the financial contracts change in a manner AEP does not anticipate, it could harm financial position or reduce the financial contribution of trading operations.Parties with whom AEP has contracts may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm AEP’s results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe AEP money or power could breach their obligations.  Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, AEP may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at then-current market prices that may exceed AEP’s contractual prices, which would cause financial results to be diminished and AEP might incur losses.  Although estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty, actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict.AEP relies on electric transmission facilities that AEP does not own or control.  If these facilities do not provide AEP with adequate transmission capacity, AEP may not be able to deliver wholesale electric power to the purchasers of AEP’s power. (Applies to all Registrants)AEP depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power AEP sells at wholesale.  This dependence exposes AEP to a variety of risks.  If transmission is disrupted, or transmission capacity is inadequate, AEP may not be able to sell and deliver AEP wholesale power.  If a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, AEP’s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited.  If restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure.The FERC has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales.  Although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions, access to transmission systems may not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable.  Management also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets.42"
10,AEP,AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER CO,2015-02-20,"ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORSGENERAL RISKS OF OUR REGULATED OPERATIONSWe may not be able to recover the costs of our substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions. – Affecting each RegistrantOur business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits, construction of additional transmission facilities, modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives.  Our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions.  If these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates we charge, we would not be able to recover the costs associated with our planned extensive investment.  This would cause our financial results to be diminished.Our regulated electric revenues, earnings and results are dependent on state regulation that may limit our ability to recover costs and other amounts. – Affecting each RegistrantThe rates our customers pay to our regulated utility businesses are subject to approval by the FERC and the respective state utility commissions of Ohio, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, Oklahoma, Indiana, Louisiana, Kentucky, Arkansas, Michigan and Tennessee. If our regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the relevant commissions, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions, which may decrease our future earnings. Additionally, if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. Similarly, if recovery or other rate relief authorized in the past is overturned or reversed on appeal, our future earnings could be negatively impacted. Any regulatory action or litigation outcome that triggers a reversal of a regulatory asset or deferred cost, including fuel and related costs, generally results in an impairment to the balance sheet and a charge to the income statement of the company involved.Our transmission investment strategy and execution bears certain risks associated with these activities. – Affecting each RegistrantWe expect that a growing portion of our earnings in the future will derive from the transmission investments and activities of AEPTCo and our transmission joint ventures.  FERC policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction.  If FERC were to adopt a different policy, if states were to limit or restrict such policies, or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected, our strategy of investing in transmission could be curtailed.  We believe our experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives us an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install, construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities.  However, there can be no assurance that PJM, SPP or other RTOs will authorize any new transmission projects or will award any such projects to us.  If the FERC were to lower the rate of return it has authorized for our transmission investments and facilities, or if one or more states were to successfully limit FERC jurisdiction on recovery of costs on transmission investment and its return, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.34We may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled. – Affecting each RegistrantOur business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks, including construction delays, nonperformance by equipment and other third party suppliers, and increases in equipment and labor costs.  To limit the risks of these construction projects, we enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits.  If any of these projects is canceled for any reason, including our failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits, we could incur significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts.  In addition, if we have recorded any construction work or investments as an asset, we may need to impair that asset in the event the project is canceled.We are exposed to nuclear generation risk. – Affecting AEP and I&MThrough I&M, we own the Cook Plant.  It consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2,191 MW, or about 6% of the generating capacity in the AEP System.  We are, therefore, subject to the risks of nuclear generation, which include the following:•The potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials such as spent nuclear fuel.•Limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with our nuclear operations.•Uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts triggered by a loss event (federal law requires owners of nuclear units to purchase the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance and potentially contribute to the losses of others).•Uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives.There can be no assurance that I&M’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if and when these risks are triggered.The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities.  In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants such as ours.  In addition, although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our plants, if an incident did occur, it could harm our results of operations or financial condition.  A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.  Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S. could require us to make material contributory payments.Costs associated with the operation (including fuel), maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation, in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards, availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities.  Costs also may include replacement power, any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the Cook Plant (whether scheduled or premature), the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs.  Our ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the Cook Plant is not assured.35The different regional power markets in which we compete or will compete in the future have changing market and transmission structures, which could affect our performance in these regions. – Affecting each RegistrantOur results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets.  The rules governing the various regional power markets, including SPP and PJM, may also change from time to time which could affect our costs or revenues.  Because the manner in which RTOs will evolve remains unclear, we are unable to assess fully the impact that changes in these power markets may have on our business.We could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards. – Affecting each RegistrantAs a result of EPACT, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by the FERC.  The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles.  Compliance with new reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures.  While we expect to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates, there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner.  If we were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates.RISKS RELATED TO MARKET, ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL VOLATILITY AND OTHER RISKSOur financial performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions. – Affecting each RegistrantOur performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of our generation, transmission and distribution facilities.  Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:•Operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes.•Operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements.•Labor disputes.•Compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards.•Information technology failure that impairs our information technology infrastructure or disrupts normal business operations.•Information technology failure that affects our ability to access customer information or causes us to lose confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects our reputation or exposes us to legal claims.•Fuel or water supply interruptions caused by transportation constraints, adverse weather such as drought, non-performance by our suppliers and other factors.•Catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, hurricanes, tornados, ice storms, terrorism (including cyber-terrorism), floods or other similar occurrences.Hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair our operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information and damage our reputation. – Affecting each RegistrantWe own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems. Further, the computer systems that run our facilities are not completely isolated from external networks. Parties that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system or our operations could view our computer systems, software or networks as targets for cyber attack.  In addition, our business requires that we collect and maintain sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss.36A successful cyber attack on the systems that control our generation, transmission, distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing us from serving customers or collecting revenues. The breach of certain business systems could affect our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to our reputation. In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring. We maintain cyber insurance to cover liabilities and losses directly arising from a potential cyber event.  We also maintain property and casualty insurance that may cover certain resultant physical damage or third-party injuries caused by potential cyber events.  However, damage and claims arising from such incidents may exceed the amount of any insurance available and other damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered at all. For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.In an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber intrusions, we have a comprehensive cyber security program designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and systems. In addition, we are subject to mandatory cyber security regulatory requirements. However, cyber threats continue to evolve and adapt, and, as a result, there is a risk that we could experience a successful cyber attack despite our current security posture and regulatory compliance efforts.If we are unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. – Affecting each RegistrantWe rely on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows.  Volatility and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect our ability to raise capital and fund our capital needs, including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness.  In addition, if capital is available only on less than reasonable terms or to borrowers whose creditworthiness is better than ours, capital costs could increase materially.  Restricted access to capital markets and/or increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.Downgrades in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital and/or to operate our power trading businesses. – Affecting each RegistrantThe credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings.  Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to us and could limit our access to funding for our operations.  Our business is capital intensive, and we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive.  In periods of market turmoil, access to capital is difficult for all borrowers.  If our ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained, our interest costs will likely increase and could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.Our power trading business relies on the investment grade ratings of our individual public utility subsidiaries’ senior unsecured long-term debt or on the investment grade ratings of AEP.  Most of our counterparties require the creditworthiness of an investment grade entity to stand behind transactions.  If those ratings were to decline below investment grade, our ability to operate our power trading business profitably would be diminished because we would likely have to deposit cash or cash-related instruments which would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.AEP has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other obligations due it from its subsidiaries. – Affecting AEPAEP is a holding company and has no operations of its own.  Its ability to meet its financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries, primarily its regulated utilities, and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to, or repay loans from, AEP.  Its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation (apart from loans 37from AEP) to provide AEP with funds for its payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions or other payments.  Payments to AEP by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations.  AEP indebtedness and common stock dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness.Our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions. – Affecting each RegistrantElectric power generation is generally a seasonal business.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter.  As a result, our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the terms of power sale contracts that we enter into.  In addition, we have historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder.  Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  Conversely, unusually extreme weather conditions could increase AEP’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable.Further, deteriorating economic conditions generally result in reduced consumption by our customers, particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely, while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues.  As a result, prevailing economic conditions may reduce our future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm our results of operations. – Affecting each RegistrantCertain events, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs.  The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development.  In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise.  Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business.  If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our future net income and cash flows may be reduced.Changes in commodity prices and the costs of transport may increase our cost of producing power or decrease the amount we receive from selling power, harming our financial performance. – Affecting each RegistrantWe are exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal and the price and availability to transport coal.  We have existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of coal, but as these contracts end or otherwise are not honored, we may not be able to purchase coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts.  Similarly, we are exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances.  We use emission allowances based on the amount of coal we use as fuel and the reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures.  As long as current environmental programs remain in effect, we have sufficient emission allowances to cover the majority of our projected needs for the next two years and beyond.  If the Federal EPA is able to create a replacement rule to reduce interstate transport, and it is acceptable by the courts, additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions.  If we need to obtain allowances under a replacement rule, those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs.  Our risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge.38We also own natural gas-fired facilities which exposes us to market prices of natural gas.  Historically, natural gas prices have tended to be more volatile than prices for other fuel sources. Recently however, the availability of natural gas from shale production has lessened price volatility. Our ability to make sales at a profit is highly dependent on the price of natural gas.  As the price of natural gas falls, other market participants that utilize natural gas-fired generation will be able to offer electricity at increasingly competitive prices relative to our sales prices, so the margins we realize from sales will be lower and, on occasion, we may need to curtail operation of marginal plants.  We expect the availability of shale natural gas and issues related to its accessibility will have a long-term material effect on the price and volatility of natural gas.Prices for coal, natural gas and emission allowances have shown material upward and downward swings in the past.  Changes in the cost of coal, emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.In addition, actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value our trading and marketing transactions, and those differences may be material.  As a result, as those transactions are marked to market, those transactions may reduce future results of operations and cash flows and impact financial condition.Our AEP River Operations segment is subject to risks that are beyond our control. – Affecting AEPOur AEP River Operations segment transports liquid, coal and dry bulk commodities primarily on the Ohio, Illinois and lower Mississippi rivers.  These activities can be hazardous and depend on natural conditions and forces.  Our river transport operations could result in an environmental event such as a serious spill or release.  In addition, if drought conditions or other factors cause the water levels of one or more of these rivers to drop below the amount necessary to permit commercial barging traffic, it would prevent our AEP River Operations from transporting cargo on the affected river.  Conversely, if unusually high amounts of precipitation or other factors cause the water levels of one or more of these rivers to be too high to permit commercial barging traffic, it would prevent our AEP River Operations from transporting cargo on the affected river.  Extreme water levels that do not close river basin commercial traffic can still harm our business if the levels curtail the total volume permitted to move on the affected river. The levels on portions of the Mississippi River in 2013 were near the lowest since the levels caused by severe drought in 1988.  Water levels during 2014 were improved and generally considered favorable for barge operations.  Any reduction in the commercial activities of our AEP River Operations due to extreme water levels could reduce future net income and cash flows.We are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change. – Affecting each RegistrantClimate change creates physical and financial risk.  Physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events.  Our customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity.  For residential customers, heating and cooling represent their largest energy use.  To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers’ energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes.Increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in additional generating assets, transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load.  Decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect our financial condition, through decreased revenues.  Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stress, including service interruptions.  Weather conditions outside of our service territory could also have an impact on our revenues.  We buy and sell electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities.  Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on our own and/or other systems may raise electricity prices as we buy short-term energy to serve our own system, which would increase the cost of energy we provide to our customers.39Severe weather impacts our service territories, primarily when thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes and snow or ice storms occur.  To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase our cost of providing service.  Changes in precipitation resulting in droughts or water shortages could adversely affect our operations, principally our fossil generating units.  A negative impact to water supplies due to long-term drought conditions could adversely impact our ability to provide electricity to customers, as well as increase the price they pay for energy.  We may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks.To the extent climate change impacts a region’s economic health, it may also impact our revenues.  Our financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies we serve.  The price of energy, as a factor in a region’s cost of living as well as an important input into the cost of goods and services, has an impact on the economic health of our communities.We cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to our business activities. – Affecting each RegistrantWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising out of our business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements entitled Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.  Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.RISKS RELATING TO STATE RESTRUCTURINGCustomers are choosing alternative electric generation service providers, as allowed by Ohio law and regulation. – Affecting AEPUnder current Ohio law, electric generation is sold in a competitive market in Ohio and native load customers in Ohio have the ability to switch to alternative suppliers for their electric generation service.  CRES providers are targeting retail customers by offering alternative generation service.   As customer switching in Ohio continues, it could reduce AGR’s future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.Collection of our revenues in Texas is concentrated in a limited number of REPs. – Affecting AEPOur revenues from the distribution of electricity in the ERCOT area of Texas are collected from REPs that supply the electricity we distribute to their customers.  Currently, we do business with approximately one hundred REPs.  In 2014, TCC’s largest REP accounted for 25% of its operating revenue and its second largest REP accounted for 23% of its operating revenue; TNC’s largest REP accounted for 11% of its operating revenues, and its second largest REP accounted for 9% of its operating revenues.  Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the Texas market or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for our services or cause them to delay such payments.  We depend on these REPs for timely remittance of payments.  Any delay or default in payment could reduce future cash flows and impact financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO OWNING AND OPERATING GENERATION ASSETS AND SELLING POWEROur costs of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant. – Affecting each RegistrantOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety.  Approximately 90% of the electricity generated by the AEP System is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels.  Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury and particulates from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations, controls and mitigation expenses.  Compliance with these legal requirements requires us to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees and permits at all of our facilities and could cause us to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.  These expenditures have been significant in the past, and we expect that they will continue to be significant in order to comply with the current and proposed regulations.  Costs of compliance with environmental regulations could reduce future net income and 40impact financial condition, especially if emission and/or discharge limits are tightened, more extensive permitting requirements are imposed or additional substances become regulated.  If we retire generation plants prior to the end of their estimated useful life, there can be no assurance that we will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants.  We typically recover our expenditures for pollution control technologies, replacement generation, undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions.  Failure to recover these costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and possibly harm our financial condition.   For our sales of energy from our competitive units, there is no such cost-recovery mechanism.   As a result, we may not recover our costs through the market and we may be forced to shut competitive units down.  The costs of compliance for our competitive units could reduce our future net income and cash flows and possibly harm our financial condition.Regulation of CO2 emissions could materially increase costs to us and our customers or cause some of our electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain. – Affecting each RegistrantThe U.S. Congress has not taken any significant steps toward enacting legislation to control CO2 emissions since 2009.  In December 2009, the Federal EPA issued a final endangerment finding under the CAA regarding emissions from motor vehicles.  The Federal EPA finalized CO2 emission standards for new motor vehicles and issued a rule that implements a permitting program for new and modified stationary sources of CO2 emissions in a phased manner.  Several groups have filed challenges to the endangerment finding and the Federal EPA’s subsequent rulemakings.  The Supreme Court agreed to review whether the Federal EPA reasonably determined that establishing standards for new motor vehicles automatically triggered regulation of stationary sources through the prevention of significant deterioration and Title V permitting programs, and determined that the Federal EPA was neither compelled nor authorized to automatically regulate stationary sources of CO2 emissions under these programs, but that the Federal EPA could establish requirements for best available control technology reviews of CO2 emissions for sources otherwise required to obtain a Prevention of Significant Deterioration permit if their emissions exceed a reasonable level.  The Federal EPA must undertake additional rulemaking to establish such requirements and a reasonable level.In 2012, the Federal EPA issued a proposed CO2 emissions standard for new power generation sources.  In response to the comments submitted on this proposed rule, and in accordance with a directive from the President, the Federal EPA withdrew the April 2012 proposed rule and has issued a new proposal.  This proposed rule includes separate, but equivalent, standards for natural gas and coal-fired units, based on the use of partial carbon capture and storage at coal units.  In June 2014, the Federal EPA issued standards for modified and reconstructed units, and a guideline for the development of state implementation plans that would reduce carbon emissions from existing utility units. The guidelines for existing sources include aggressive emission rate goals that are composed of a number of measures.  Management believes some policy approaches being discussed would have significant and widespread negative consequences for the national economy and major U.S. industrial enterprises, including AEP and our customers.CO2 standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs and could impact the dates for retirement of our coal-fired units.  We typically recover costs of complying with new requirements such as the potential CO2 and other greenhouse gases emission standards from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions.  For our sales of energy into the markets, however, there is no such recovery mechanism.  Failure to recover these costs, should they arise, could reduce our future net income and cash flows and possibly harm our financial condition.41We may be harmed if our merchant generation fleet is not profitable or loses value. – Affecting AEPWe are evaluating strategic alternatives for our merchant generation fleet, which primarily includes AGR’s generation fleet which operates in PJM and a 54.7% interest in the Oklaunion Plant which operates in ERCOT.    Potential alternatives may include, but are not limited to, continued operation of the merchant generation fleet, executing a PPA with a regulated affiliate for certain merchant generation units in Ohio, a spin-off of the merchant generation fleet or a sale of the merchant generation fleet.  We have not made a decision regarding the potential alternatives, nor have we set a specific timeframe for a decision.  Certain of these alternatives could result in a loss which could reduce future net income and cash flow and impact financial condition.Amounts we receive from the results of PJM capacity auctions associated with our nonregulated generation assets could fail to adequately compensate us. – Affecting AEPFinancial returns on AGR’s generation capacity are subject to the results of annual PJM capacity auctions.  Recent auction results indicate a great deal of volatility and the possibility of clearing prices substantially lower than the cost of such capacity.   We expect a significant decline in AGR capacity revenues after May 2015 when the Power Supply Agreement between AGR and OPCo ends.  Additionally, we expect a decline in AGR capacity revenues from June 2016 through May 2017 based upon the decrease in the PJM base auction price.  PJM recently proposed at FERC a set of supplemental auctions for 2016/17 and 2017/18.  Those auctions may mitigate the decline in capacity revenues.  However, this proposal has not yet been accepted at FERC and we can give no assurance that the FERC will approve the proposal.  If the PJM capacity auctions continue to result in clearing prices lower than the cost of our capacity, it could reduce our future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.Courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims in the future may order us to pay damages or to limit or reduce our emissions. – Affecting each RegistrantIn the past, there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which we, among others, were defendants.  In general, the actions allege that emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance.  The plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief.  If future actions are resolved against us, substantial modifications of our existing coal-fired power plants could be required and we might be required to limit or reduce emissions.  Such remedies could require us to purchase power from third parties to fulfill our commitments to supply power to our customers.  This could have a material impact on our costs.  In addition, we could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment, accelerate the timing of capital expenditures, pay damages or penalties and/or halt operations.  While management believes such costs should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business in our jurisdictions where generation rates are set on a cost of service basis, without such recovery, those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and harm our financial condition.  Moreover, our results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation.Changes in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of our generating facilities. – Affecting each RegistrantWe primarily generate electricity at large central facilities.  This method results in economies of scale and lower costs than (a) newer technologies such as fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells and (b) distributed generation using either new or existing technology.  Other technologies, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), increase the efficiency of electricity and, as a result, lower the demand for it. It is possible that advances in technologies, the availability of distributed generation or changes in regulatory policies will lower the demand for electricity or reduce the costs of new technology to levels that are equal to or below that of most central station electricity production, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.42Our profitability is impacted by our continued authorization to sell power at market-based rates. – Affecting each RegistrantFERC has granted AGR, APCo, I&M, KPCo, OPCo, PSO and SWEPCo authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. FERC reserves the right to revoke or revise this market-based rate authority if it subsequently determines that one or more of these companies can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions.  Each company that has obtained market-based rate authority from FERC must file a market power update every three years to show that they continue to meet FERC’s standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether entities qualify for market-based rates.  The loss of market-based rate authority by any of these entities, especially by AGR, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Our revenues and results of operations from selling power are subject to market risks that are beyond our control. – Affecting each RegistrantWe sell power from our generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis.  We also enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity, natural gas, emission allowances and coal as part of our power marketing and energy trading operations.  With respect to such transactions, the rate of return on our capital investments is not determined through mandated rates, and our revenues and results of operations are likely to depend, in large part, upon prevailing market prices for power in our regional markets and other competitive markets.  These market prices can fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time.  Trading margins may erode as markets mature and there may be diminished opportunities for gain should volatility decline.  In addition, the FERC, which has jurisdiction over wholesale power rates, as well as RTOs that oversee some of these markets, may impose price limitations, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets.  Power supply and other similar agreements entered into during extreme market conditions may subsequently be held to be unenforceable by a reviewing court or the FERC.  Fuel and emissions prices may also be volatile, and the price we can obtain for power sales may not change at the same rate as changes in fuel and/or emissions costs.  These factors could reduce our margins and therefore diminish our revenues and results of operations.  Volatility in market prices for fuel and power may result from:•Weather conditions, including storms.•Economic conditions.•Outages of major generation or transmission facilities.•Seasonality.•Power usage.•Illiquid markets.•Transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies.•Availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources.•Demand for energy commodities.•Natural gas, crude oil and refined products and coal production levels.•Natural disasters, wars, embargoes and other catastrophic events.•Federal, state and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation and/or incentives.Commodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not eliminated. – Affecting each RegistrantWe attempt to manage the exposure of or power trading activities by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management procedures.  These risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate the risks associated with these activities.  As a result, we cannot predict the impact that our energy trading and risk management decisions may have on our business, operating results or financial position.We routinely have open trading positions in the market, within guidelines we set, resulting from the management of our trading portfolio.  To the extent open trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results and financial position.43Our power trading risk management activities, including our power sales agreements with counterparties, rely on projections that depend heavily on judgments and assumptions by management of factors such as the future market prices and demand for power and other energy-related commodities.  These factors become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future these estimates are made.  Even when our policies and procedures are followed and decisions are made based on these estimates, results of operations may be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those calculations prove to be inaccurate.We may not successfully manage the uncertainty involved with our power trading (including coal, natural gas and emission allowances trading and power marketing). – Affecting each RegistrantOur power trading activities also expose us to risks of commodity price movements.  To the extent that our power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns, or controls, through long-term power purchase agreements, we would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices.For example, the use of new technologies to recover natural gas from shale deposits has increased natural gas supply and reserves, placing further downward pressure on natural gas prices, and has reduced the need for our coal-fired generation. Further, in the event that alternative generation resources, such as wind and solar, are mandated or otherwise subsidized or encouraged through climate legislation or regulation and added to the available generation supply, such resources could displace a higher marginal cost fossil plant, which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity. This occurrence could then reduce the market price at which all generators in that region would be able to sell their output. These events could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and could also result in an impairment of certain long-lived assets.In connection with these trading activities, we routinely enter into financial contracts, including futures and options, over-the counter options, financially-settled swaps and other derivative contracts.  These activities expose us to risks from price movements.  If the values of the financial contracts change in a manner we do not anticipate, it could harm our financial position or reduce the financial contribution of our trading operations.Parties with whom we have contracts may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm our results of operations. – Affecting each RegistrantWe are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe us money or power could breach their obligations.  Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at then-current market prices that may exceed our contractual prices, which would cause our financial results to be diminished and we might incur losses.  Although our estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty, our actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict.We rely on electric transmission facilities that we do not own or control.  If these facilities do not provide us with adequate transmission capacity, we may not be able to deliver our wholesale electric power to the purchasers of our power. – Affecting each RegistrantWe depend on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power we sell at wholesale.  This dependence exposes us to a variety of risks.  If transmission is disrupted, or transmission capacity is inadequate, we may not be able to sell and deliver our wholesale power.  If a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, our recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited.  If restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure.The FERC has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales.  Although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions, access to transmission systems may in fact not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable.  We also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets.44"
4,AEP,AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER CO,2014-02-25,"ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORSGENERAL RISKS OF OUR REGULATED OPERATIONSWe may not be able to recover the costs of our substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions. – Affecting each RegistrantOur business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits, construction of additional transmission facilities, modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives.  Our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions.  If these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates we charge, we would not be able to recover the costs associated with our planned extensive investment.  This would cause our financial results to be diminished.Approval of the June 2012 through May 2015 ESP order in Ohio may be overturned and is subject to appeal. – Affecting AEP and OPCoIn August 2012, the PUCO issued an order which adopted and modified an ESP through May 2015 (the “2012 ESP”).  The 2012 ESP allowed the continuation of the fuel adjustment clause, maintained recovery of several previous ESP riders and approved a storm damage recovery mechanism.  The 2012 ESP further established (a) a non-bypassable Distribution Investment Rider effective September 2012 through May 2015 to recover certain distribution investment, and (b) a non-bypassable Retail Stability Rider (RSR), a portion of which provides for the collection of deferred capacity costs.  The deferred capacity costs may exceed the amount we will collect under the RSR.  In January 2013, the PUCO issued an order on rehearing for the 2012 ESP which generally upheld its prior order.  Intervenors are challenging various parts of these orders at the PUCO and with the Supreme Court of Ohio.  In parallel proceedings, the PUCO addressed certain issues around the energy auctions while other issues were deferred to a separate docket.  The PUCO has agreed to issue a request for an independent auditor in the fuel adjustment clause proceeding to separately examine the recovery of the fixed fuel costs.  If all or part of 2012 ESP is overturned by the PUCO or the Supreme Court of Ohio, or if deferred capacity and other costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.Our request for an ESP from June 2015 through May 2018 may not be approved in its entirety. – Affecting AEP and OPCoIn December 2013, OPCo filed an application with the PUCO to approve an ESP that includes proposed rate adjustments and the continuation and modification of certain existing riders, effective June 2015 through May 2018.  The proposal includes a return on common equity of 10.65% for certain riders.  Additionally, the application identifies OPCo’s intention to submit a separate application to continue the RSR in which the unrecovered portion of the deferred capacity costs will continue to be collected until the balance of the capacity deferrals has been collected.  If the PUCO denies all or part of the requested ESP, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.Ohio may require us to refund revenue that we have collected. – Affecting AEP and OPCoOhio law requires that the PUCO determine on an annual basis if rate adjustments included in prior orders resulted in significantly excessive earnings.  If the PUCO determines there were significantly excessive earnings, the excess amount could be returned to customers.  In November 2013, OPCo filed its 2011 and 2012 significantly excessive earnings filings with the PUCO.  If the PUCO determines that OPCo’s earnings were significantly excessive, and requires OPCo to return a portion of its revenues to customers, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.We may not recover deferred fuel costs. – Affecting AEP and OPCoIn August 2012, the PUCO ordered recovery of deferred fuel costs beginning September 2012 through the Phase-In Recovery Rider.  The August 2012 order was upheld by the PUCO in October 2012.  OPCo and intervenors have filed appeals at the Supreme Court of Ohio.  If the Supreme Court of Ohio does not permit full recovery of OPCo’s deferred fuel costs, it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  32  Ohio may require us to refund additional fuel costs. – Affecting AEP and OPCoIn January 2012, the PUCO ordered that proceeds from a 2008 coal contract settlement agreement be applied against OPCo’s under-recovered fuel balance and that an outside consultant be hired to review our fuel procurement through 2011.  The audit by the outside consultant included recommendations that would limit some of our fuel recovery or require us to refund certain fuel costs already incurred.  In addition, an intervenor filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio challenging the recovery of certain fuel costs.  Any reduction to our fuel recovery by the PUCO and/or the Supreme Court of Ohio could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.We may not fully recover all of the investment in and expenses related to the Turk Plant – Affecting AEP and SWEPCoIn December 2012, SWEPCo placed the Turk Plant in Arkansas into commercial operation.  SWEPCo holds a 73% ownership interest in the 600 MW coal-fired generating facility.  SWEPCo had originally intended that the Arkansas jurisdictional share of the Turk Plant (approximately 20%) would become part of the rate base for its retail customers in Arkansas.  Following a proceeding at the Arkansas Supreme Court, the APSC issued an order which reversed and set aside a previously granted Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Need.  The Arkansas portion of the Turk Plant output is currently not subject to cost-based rate recovery and is being sold into the wholesale market.  In addition, in February 2013, the LPSC granted recovery for the Louisiana portion of the Turk Plant costs in a formula rate filing, subject to refund based on the staff review of the cost of service and prudence review of the Turk Plant.  If SWEPCo cannot recover all of its investment and expenses related to the Turk Plant either through retail rates or sales into the wholesale market, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.Request for rate recovery in Indiana may be overturned on appeal. – Affecting AEP and I&MIn February 2013, the IURC issued an order granting an annual increase in base rates.  In March 2013, the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) filed an appeal of the order with the Indiana Court of Appeals.  In September 2013, the OUCC filed a brief on appeal that included objections to certain aspects of the rate case.  If any part of the order is overturned by the Indiana Court of Appeals, it could reduce future net income and cash flows.Approved recovery related to enabling the useful life of the Cook Plant may be overturned on appeal or further consideration. – Affecting AEP and I&MIn April and May 2012, I&M filed petitions with the IURC and the MPSC, respectively, for approval of the Cook Plant Life Cycle Management Project (LCM Project), which consists of a group of capital projects for Cook Plant, Units 1 and 2 intended to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the plant through its extended licensed life (2034 for Unit 1 and 2037 for Unit 2).  The estimated cost of the LCM Project is $1.2 billion to be incurred through 2018, excluding AFUDC.  In January 2013, the MPSC approved a Certificate of Need (CON) for the LCM Project.  In February 2013, intervenors filed appeals with the Michigan Court of Appeals objecting to the issuance of the CON as well as the amount of the CON related to the LCM Project.  In July 2013, the IURC approved I&M’s proposed project apart from a minor exception which the IURC stated I&M could seek recovery in a base rate case.  I&M was granted recovery through an LCM Project Rider to be determined in a series of proceedings beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013 and then semi-annually thereafter.  If I&M is not ultimately permitted to recover its LCM Project costs, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.Request for rate recovery in Texas may not be approved in its entirety and could be overturned. – Affecting AEP and SWEPCoIn July 2012, SWEPCo filed a request with the PUCT for an increase in Texas base rates.  In October 2013, the PUCT issued an order that granted part of the requested rate recovery.  Additionally, the PUCT determined that it would defer consideration of the requested increase in depreciation expense related to the change in the 2016 retirement date of the Welsh Plant, Unit 2.  If SWEPCo cannot ultimately recover its Texas jurisdictional share of the investment and expenses related to the Turk Plant transmission lines or Welsh Plant, Unit 2, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  33  Request for rate recovery in Oklahoma may not be approved in its entirety. – Affecting AEP and PSOIn January 2014, PSO filed a request with the OCC to increase annual base rates by $38 million, based upon a 10.5% return on common equity.  If PSO cannot ultimately recover its costs that are the subject of this request, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.Our transmission investment strategy and execution bears certain risks associated with these activities. – Affecting AEPWe expect that a growing portion of our earnings in the future will derive from the transmission investments and activities of AEPTCo and our transmission joint ventures.  FERC policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction.  If FERC were to adopt a different policy or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected, our strategy of investing in transmission could be curtailed.  We believe our experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives us an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install, construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities.  However, there can be no assurance that PJM, SPP or other RTOs will authorize any new transmission projects or will award any such projects to us.  If the FERC were to lower the rate of return it has authorized for our transmission investments and facilities, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.We may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled. – Affecting each RegistrantOur business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks, including construction delays, nonperformance by equipment and other third party suppliers, and increases in equipment and labor costs.  To limit the risks of these construction projects, we enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits.  If any of these projects is canceled for any reason, including our failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits, we could incur significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts.  In addition, if we have recorded any construction work or investments as an asset, we may need to impair that asset in the event the project is canceled.Rate regulation may delay or deny full recovery of capital improvements, additions, storm damage operations and maintenance expense repairs and other costs. – Affecting each RegistrantOur public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions.  These rates are generally regulated based on an analysis of the applicable utility’s expenses incurred in a test year.  Thus, commission-approved rates may or may not match a utility’s expenses at any given time.  There may also be a delay between the timing of when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered.  We often finance the operations and maintenance expense to repair facilities damaged by storms or other severe weather events until the operations and maintenance storm costs, including any deferred regulatory assets, are recovered in rates.  We have also traditionally financed capital investments and improvements until the new asset was placed in service.  Provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment, the asset was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery.  Similarly, long lead times in construction and scheduled repairs, the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets have heightened the risks involved in our capital investments, repairs and improvements.  While we are actively pursuing strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow, including pre-approvals, a return on construction work in progress, rider/trackers, formula rates and the inclusion of future test-year projections into rates, there can be no assurance that these will be adopted, that the applicable regulatory commission will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will be done in a timely manner.  34  Certain of our revenues and results of operations are subject to risks that are beyond our control. – Affecting each RegistrantOur operations are structured to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations and we take measures to minimize the risk of significant disruptions. Material disruptions at one or more of our operational facilities, however, could negatively impact our revenues, operating and capital expenditures and results of operations.  Such events may also create additional risks related to the supply and/or cost of equipment and materials.  We could experience unexpected but significant interruption due to several events, including, but not limited to:·  Major facility or equipment failure.·  An environmental event such as a serious spill or release.·  Fires, floods, droughts, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados or other natural disasters.·  Wars, terrorist acts (including cyber-terrorism) or threats and other catastrophic events.·  Significant health impairments or disease events.·  Other serious operational problems.We are exposed to nuclear generation risk. – Affecting AEP and I&MThrough I&M, we own the Cook Plant.  It consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2,191 MW, or about 6% of the generating capacity in the AEP System.  We are, therefore, subject to the risks of nuclear generation, which include the following:·  The potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials such as spent nuclear fuel.·  Limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with our nuclear operations.·  Uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts triggered by a loss event (federal law requires owners of nuclear units to purchase the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance and potentially contribute to the losses of others).·  Uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives.There can be no assurance that I&M’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if and when these risks are triggered.The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities.  In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants such as ours.  In addition, although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our plants, if an incident did occur, it could harm our results of operations or financial condition.  A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.  Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S. could require us to make material contributory payments.Costs associated with the operation (including fuel), maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation, in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards, availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities.  Costs also may include replacement power, any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the Cook Plant (whether scheduled or premature), the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs.  Our ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the Cook Plant is not assured.  35  The different regional power markets in which we compete or will compete in the future have changing market and transmission structures, which could affect our performance in these regions. – Affecting each RegistrantOur results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets.  The rules governing the various regional power markets, including SPP and PJM, may also change from time to time which could affect our costs or revenues.  Because the manner in which RTOs will evolve remains unclear, we are unable to assess fully the impact that changes in these power markets may have on our business.We could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards. – Affecting each RegistrantAs a result of EPACT, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by the FERC.  The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles.  Compliance with new reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures.  While we expect to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates, there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner.  If we were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates.RISKS RELATED TO MARKET, ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL VOLATILITY AND OTHER RISKSOur financial performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions. – Affecting each RegistrantOur performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of our generation, transmission and distribution facilities.  Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:·  Operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes.·  Operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements.·  Labor disputes.·  Compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards.·  Information technology failure that impairs our information technology infrastructure or disrupts normal business operations.·  Information technology failure that affects our ability to access customer information or causes us to lose confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects our reputation or exposes us to legal claims.·  Fuel or water supply interruptions caused by transportation constraints, adverse weather such as drought, non-performance by our suppliers and other factors.·  Catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, hurricanes, tornados, ice storms, terrorism (including cyber-terrorism), floods or other similar occurrences.Hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair our operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information and damage our reputation. – Affecting each RegistrantWe own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems. Further, the computer systems that run our facilities are not completely isolated from external networks. Parties that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system or our operations could view our computer systems, software or networks as targets for cyber attack.  In addition, our business requires that we collect and maintain sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss.  36  A successful cyber attack on the systems that control our generation, transmission, distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing us from serving customers or collecting revenues. The breach of certain business systems could affect our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to our reputation. In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring. We maintain property and casualty insurance that may cover certain physical damage or third-party injuries caused by potential cyber security incidents.  However, other damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available. For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.In an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber intrusions, we have a comprehensive cyber security program designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and systems. In addition, we are subject to mandatory cyber security regulatory requirements. However, cyber threats continue to evolve and adapt, and, as a result, there is a risk that we could experience a successful cyber attack despite our current security posture and regulatory compliance efforts.If we are unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. – Affecting each RegistrantWe rely on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows.  Volatility and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect our ability to raise capital and fund our capital needs, including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness.  In addition, if capital is available only on less than reasonable terms or to borrowers whose creditworthiness is better than ours, capital costs could increase materially.  Restricted access to capital markets and/or increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.Downgrades in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital and/or to operate our power trading businesses. – Affecting each RegistrantThe credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings.  Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to us and could limit our access to funding for our operations.  Our business is capital intensive, and we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive.  In periods of market turmoil, access to capital is difficult for all borrowers.  If our ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained, our interest costs will likely increase and could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.Our power trading business relies on the investment grade ratings of our individual public utility subsidiaries’ senior unsecured long-term debt or on the investment grade ratings of AEP.  Most of our counterparties require the creditworthiness of an investment grade entity to stand behind transactions.  If those ratings were to decline below investment grade, our ability to operate our power trading business profitably would be diminished because we would likely have to deposit cash or cash-related instruments which would reduce our profits.AEP has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other obligations due it from its subsidiaries. – Affecting AEPAEP is a holding company and has no operations of its own.  Its ability to meet its financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries, primarily its regulated utilities, and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to, or repay loans from, AEP.  Its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation (apart from loans from AEP) to provide AEP with funds for its payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions or other payments.  Payments to AEP by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations.  AEP indebtedness and common stock dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness.  37   Our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions. – Affecting each RegistrantElectric power generation is generally a seasonal business.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter.  As a result, our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the terms of power sale contracts that we enter into.  In addition, we have historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder.  Unusually mild weather in the future could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition.  Conversely, unusually extreme weather conditions could increase AEP’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable.Further, deteriorating economic conditions generally result in reduced consumption by our customers, particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely, while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues.  As a result, our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate on the basis of prevailing economic conditions.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm our results of operations. – Affecting each RegistrantCertain events, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs.  The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development.  In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise.  Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business.  If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our results of operations could be negatively affected.Parties we have engaged to provide construction materials or services may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm our results of operations. – Affecting each RegistrantOur business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades, construction of additional generation units and transmission facilities as well as other initiatives.  We are exposed to the risk of substantial price increases in the costs of materials used in construction.  We have engaged numerous contractors and entered into a large number of agreements to acquire the necessary materials and/or obtain the required construction related services.  As a result, we are also exposed to the risk that these contractors and other counterparties could breach their obligations to us.  Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current market prices that may exceed our contractual prices and almost certainly cause delays in that and related projects.  Although our agreements are designed to mitigate the consequences of a potential default by the counterparty, our actual exposure may be greater than these mitigation provisions.  This would cause our financial results to be diminished, and we might incur losses or delays in completing construction.Changes in commodity prices and the costs of transport may increase our cost of producing power or decrease the amount we receive from selling power, harming our financial performance. – Affecting each RegistrantWe are exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal and the price and availability to transport coal.  We have existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of coal, but as these contracts end or otherwise are not honored, we may not be able to purchase coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts.  Similarly, we are exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances.  We use emission allowances based on the amount of coal we use as fuel and the reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures.  As long as current environmental programs remain in effect, we have sufficient emission allowances to cover the majority of our projected needs for the next two years and beyond.  If the Federal EPA is able to create a replacement rule to reduce interstate transport, and it is acceptable by the courts, additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions.  If we need to obtain allowances under a    38  replacement rule, those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs.  Our risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge.We also own natural gas-fired facilities which exposes us to market prices of natural gas.  Historically, natural gas prices have tended to be more volatile than prices for other fuel sources. Recently however, the availability of natural gas from shale production has lessened price volatility. Our ability to make off-system sales at a profit is highly dependent on the price of natural gas.  As the price of natural gas falls, other market participants that utilize natural gas-fired generation will be able to offer electricity at increasingly competitive prices relative to our off-system sales prices, so the margins we realize from sales will be lower and, on occasion, we may need to curtail operation of marginal plants.  We expect the availability of shale natural gas and issues related to its accessibility will have a long-term material effect on the price and volatility of natural gas.Prices for coal, natural gas and emission allowances have shown material upward and downward swings in the past.  Changes in the cost of coal, emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power will affect our financial results.In addition, actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value our trading and marketing transactions, and those differences may be material.  As a result, our financial results may be diminished in the future as those transactions are marked to market.Our AEP River Operations business segment is subject to risks that are beyond our control. – Affecting AEPOur AEP River Operations business segment transports liquid, coal and dry bulk commodities primarily on the Ohio, Illinois and lower Mississippi rivers.  These activities can be hazardous and depend on natural conditions and forces.  Our river transport operations could result in an environmental event such as a serious spill or release.  In addition, if drought conditions or other factors cause the water levels of one or more of these rivers to drop below the amount necessary to permit commercial barging traffic, it would prevent our AEP River Operations from transporting cargo on the affected river.  Conversely, if unusually high amounts of precipitation or other factors cause the water levels of one or more of these rivers to be too high to permit commercial barging traffic, it would prevent our AEP River Operations from transporting cargo on the affected river.  Extreme water levels that do not close river basin commercial traffic can still harm our business if the levels curtail the total volume permitted to move on the affected river. The levels on portions of the Mississippi River in 2013 have been reported as remaining at or approaching the lowest since the levels caused by severe drought in 1988.  Any reduction in the commercial activities of our AEP River Operations due to low water levels could reduce future net income and cash flows.We are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change. – Affecting each RegistrantThere is a growing consensus on the evidence of global climate change.  Climate change creates physical and financial risk.  Physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events.  Our customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity.  For residential customers, heating and cooling represent their largest energy use.  To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers’ energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes. Increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in additional generating assets, transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load.  Decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect our financial condition, through decreased revenues.  Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stress, including service interruptions.  Weather conditions outside of our service territory could also have an impact on our revenues.  We buy and sell electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities.  Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on our own and/or other systems may raise electricity prices as we buy short-term energy to serve our own system, which would increase the cost of energy we provide to our customers.  39  Severe weather impacts our service territories, primarily when thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes and snow or ice storms occur.  To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase our cost of providing service.  Changes in precipitation resulting in droughts or water shortages could adversely affect our operations, principally our fossil generating units.  A negative impact to water supplies due to long-term drought conditions could adversely impact our ability to provide electricity to customers, as well as increase the price they pay for energy.  We may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks.To the extent climate change impacts a region’s economic health, it may also impact our revenues.  Our financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies we serve.  The price of energy, as a factor in a region’s cost of living as well as an important input into the cost of goods and services, has an impact on the economic health of our communities.We cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to our business activities. – Affecting each RegistrantWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising out of our business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 6 of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements entitled Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.  Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.RISKS RELATING TO STATE RESTRUCTURINGCustomers are choosing alternative electric generation service providers, as allowed by Ohio law and regulation. – Affecting AEPUnder current Ohio law, electric generation is sold in a competitive market in Ohio and native load customers in Ohio have the ability to switch to alternative suppliers for their electric generation service.  CRES providers are targeting retail customers by offering alternative generation service.  Through a short term agreement, AGR provides capacity and a decreasing portion of power to the Ohio customers that have not switched.  As customer switching in Ohio continues, it could reduce AGR’s future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.Collection of our revenues in Texas is concentrated in a limited number of REPs. – Affecting AEPOur revenues from the distribution of electricity in the ERCOT area of Texas are collected from REPs that supply the electricity we distribute to their customers.  Currently, we do business with approximately one hundred REPs.  In 2013, TCC’s largest REP accounted for 29% of its operating revenue and its second largest REP accounted for 16% of its operating revenue; TNC’s largest REP accounted for 12% of its operating revenues and its second largest REP accounted for 7% of its operating revenues.  Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the Texas market or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for our services or could cause them to delay such payments.  We depend on these REPs for timely remittance of payments.  Any delay or default in payment could reduce future cash flows and impact financial condition.  40  RISKS RELATED TO OWNING AND OPERATING GENERATION ASSETS AND SELLING POWEROur costs of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant. – Affecting each RegistrantOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety.  Approximately 90% of the electricity generated by the AEP System is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels.  Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury and particulates from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations, controls and mitigation expenses.  Compliance with these legal requirements requires us to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees and permits at all of our facilities and could cause us to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.  These expenditures have been significant in the past and we expect that they will continue to be significant in order to comply with the current and proposed regulations.  Costs of compliance with environmental regulations could reduce future net income and impact financial condition, especially if emission and/or discharge limits are tightened, more extensive permitting requirements are imposed and additional substances become regulated.  If we retire generation plants prior to the end of their estimated useful life, there can be no assurance that we will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants.  We typically recover our expenditures for pollution control technologies, replacement generation and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions.  Failure to recover these costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and possibly harm our financial condition.   For our sales of energy from our competitive units, there is no such cost-recovery mechanism.   As a result, we may not recover our costs through the market and we may be forced to shut competitive units down.  The costs of compliance for our competitive units could reduce our future net income and cash flows and possibly harm our financial condition. Regulation of CO2 emissions, either through legislation or by the Federal EPA, could materially increase costs to us and our customers or cause some of our electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain. – Affecting each RegistrantThe U.S. Congress has not taken any significant steps toward enacting legislation to control CO2emissions since 2009.  In December 2009, the Federal EPA issued a final endangerment finding under the CAA regarding emissions from motor vehicles.  The Federal EPA also finalized CO2 emission standards for new motor vehicles, and issued a rule that implements a permitting program for new and modified stationary sources of CO2 emissions in a phased manner.  Several groups have filed challenges to the endangerment finding and the Federal EPA’s subsequent rulemakings.  The Supreme Court has agreed to review whether EPA reasonably determined that establishing standards for new motor vehicles automatically triggered regulation of stationary sources through the prevention of significant deterioration and Title V permitting programs.In 2012, the Federal EPA issued a proposed CO2 emissions standard for new power generation sources with a CO2 limit equivalent to a natural gas unit.  In response to the comments submitted on this proposed rule, and in accordance with a directive from the President, EPA withdrew the April 2012 proposed rule and has issued a new proposal.  This proposed rule includes separate, but equivalent, standards for natural gas and coal-fired units, based on the use of partial carbon capture and storage at coal units.  We do not believe that carbon capture and storage has been adequately demonstrated, and intend to submit comments on the proposed rule.  The President has also directed Federal EPA to issue standards for modified and reconstructed units, and a guideline for the development of state implementation plans that would reduce carbon emissions from existing utility units by June 2014, to finalize those standards by June 2015, and to require states to submit implementation plans no later than June 2016.  Management believes some policy approaches being discussed would have significant and widespread negative consequences for the national economy and major U.S. industrial enterprises, including AEP and our customers.If CO2 and other emission standards are imposed, the standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs which would impact the ultimate retirement of older, less-efficient, coal-fired units.  We typically recover costs of complying with new requirements such as the potential CO2 and other greenhouse gases emission standards from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions.  For our sales of energy based on market rate authority, however, there is no such recovery mechanism.  Failure to recover these costs, should they arise, could reduce our future net income and cash flows and possibly harm our financial condition.  41  Amounts we receive from the results of PJM capacity auctions associated with our nonregulated generation assets could fail to adequately compensate us. – Affecting AEPAt the end of last year, AGR acquired most of the generation formerly owned by OPCo.  Recovery of AGR’s generation capacity is subject to the results of annual PJM capacity auctions.  Recent auction results indicate a great deal of volatility and the possibility of clearing prices substantially lower than the cost of such capacity.  We formed a coalition with other utility companies to address mutual concerns related to the auction process and PJM has made filings with the FERC seeking modification of that process.  Additional filings are expected.  We can give no assurance that the FERC will approve any modifications to the annual PJM capacity auctions.  If the annual PJM capacity auctions continue to result in clearing prices lower than the cost of our capacity, it could reduce our future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.Courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims against us may order us to pay damages or to limit or reduce our CO2 emissions. – Affecting each RegistrantIn the past, there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which we, among others, were defendants.  In general, the actions allege that CO2 emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance due to impacts of global warming and climate change.  The plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief.  If the pending or other future actions are resolved against us, substantial modifications of our existing coal-fired power plants could be required and we might be required to limit or reduce CO2 emissions.  Such remedies could require us to purchase power from third parties to fulfill our commitments to supply power to our customers.  This could have a material impact on our costs.  In addition, we could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment, accelerate the timing of capital expenditures, pay damages or penalties and/or halt operations.  While management believes such costs should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business in our jurisdictions where generation rates are set on a cost of service basis, without such recovery those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and harm our financial condition.  Moreover, our results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation.Changes in technology and regulatory policies may cause our generating facilities to be less competitive.  – Affecting each RegistrantWe primarily generate electricity at large central facilities. This method results in economies of scale and lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells, microturbines, windmills and photovoltaic solar cells. It is possible that advances in technologies or changes in regulatory policies will reduce costs of new technology to levels that are equal to or below that of most central station electricity production, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Our profitability is impacted by our continued authorization to sell power at market-based rates.  – Affecting each RegistrantFERC has granted AEGCo, AGR, APCo, I&M, KPCo, OPCo, PSO, and SWEPCo authority to sell electricity at market-based rates (except in our balancing authority area of the SPP where our wholesale power transactions are cost-capped by FERC). FERC reserves the right to revoke or revise this market-based rate authority if it subsequently determines that one or more of these companies can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions.  Each company that has obtained market-based rate authority from FERC must file a market power update every three years to show that they continue to meet FERC’s standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether entities qualify for market-based rates.  The loss of market-based rate authority by any of these entities, especially by AGR, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Our revenues and results of operations from selling power are subject to market risks that are beyond our control. – Affecting each RegistrantWe sell power from our generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis.  We also enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity, natural gas, emission allowances and coal as part of our power marketing and energy trading operations.  With respect to such transactions, the rate of    42  return on our capital investments is not determined through mandated rates, and our revenues and results of operations are likely to depend, in large part, upon prevailing market prices for power in our regional markets and other competitive markets.  These market prices can fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time.  Trading margins may erode as markets mature and there may be diminished opportunities for gain should volatility decline.  In addition, the FERC, which has jurisdiction over wholesale power rates, as well as RTOs that oversee some of these markets, may impose price limitations, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets.  Power supply and other similar agreements entered into during extreme market conditions may subsequently be held to be unenforceable by a reviewing court or the FERC.  Fuel and emissions prices may also be volatile, and the price we can obtain for power sales may not change at the same rate as changes in fuel and/or emissions costs.  These factors could reduce our margins and therefore diminish our revenues and results of operations.  Volatility in market prices for fuel and power may result from:·  Weather conditions, including storms.·  Economic conditions.·  Outages of major generation or transmission facilities.·  Seasonality.·  Power usage.·  Illiquid markets.·  Transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies.·  Availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources.·  Demand for energy commodities.·  Natural gas, crude oil and refined products and coal production levels.·  Natural disasters, wars, embargoes and other catastrophic events.·  Federal, state and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation and/or incentives.Commodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not eliminated. – Affecting each RegistrantWe attempt to manage the exposure of or power trading activities by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management procedures.  These risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate the risks associated with these activities.  As a result, we cannot predict the impact that our energy trading and risk management decisions may have on our business, operating results or financial position.We routinely have open trading positions in the market, within guidelines we set, resulting from the management of our trading portfolio.  To the extent open trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results and financial position.Our power trading risk management activities, including our power sales agreements with counterparties, rely on projections that depend heavily on judgments and assumptions by management of factors such as the future market prices and demand for power and other energy-related commodities.  These factors become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future these estimates are made.  Even when our policies and procedures are followed and decisions are made based on these estimates, results of operations may be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those calculations prove to be inaccurate.We may not successfully manage the uncertainty involved with our power trading (including coal, natural gas and emission allowances trading and power marketing). – Affecting each RegistrantOur power trading activities also expose us to risks of commodity price movements.  To the extent that our power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns, or controls, through long-term power purchase agreements, we would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices.For example, the use of new technologies to recover natural gas from shale deposits has increased natural gas supply and reserves, placing further downward pressure on natural gas prices and has reduced the need for our coal-fired generation. Further, in the event that alternative generation resources, such as wind and solar, are mandated or otherwise subsidized or encouraged through climate legislation or regulation and added to the available generation supply, such resources could displace a higher marginal cost fossil plant, which could reduce the price at which    43  market participants sell their electricity. This occurrence could then reduce the market price at which all generators in that region would be able to sell their output. These events could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and could also result in an impairment of certain long-lived assets.In connection with these trading activities, we routinely enter into financial contracts, including futures and options, over-the counter options, financially-settled swaps and other derivative contracts.  These activities expose us to risks from price movements.  If the values of the financial contracts change in a manner we do not anticipate, it could harm our financial position or reduce the financial contribution of our trading operations.Parties with whom we have contracts may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm our results of operations. – Affecting each RegistrantWe are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe us money or power could breach their obligations.  Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at then-current market prices that may exceed our contractual prices, which would cause our financial results to be diminished and we might incur losses.  Although our estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty, our actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict.We rely on electric transmission facilities that we do not own or control.  If these facilities do not provide us with adequate transmission capacity, we may not be able to deliver our wholesale electric power to the purchasers of our power. – Affecting each RegistrantWe depend on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power we sell at wholesale.  This dependence exposes us to a variety of risks.  If transmission is disrupted, or transmission capacity is inadequate, we may not be able to sell and deliver our wholesale power.  If a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, our recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited.  If restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure.The FERC has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales.  Although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions, access to transmission systems may in fact not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable.  We also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets.Financial derivatives reforms could increase the liquidity needs and costs of our commercial trading operations. – Affecting each RegistrantIn July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law (Dodd-Frank Act).  The federal legislation was enacted to reform financial markets and significantly alter how over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives are regulated.  The law increased regulatory oversight of OTC energy derivatives, including: (a) imposing pervasive regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on dealers and traders who hold significant positions in swaps, (b) requiring certain standardized OTC derivatives to be traded on registered exchanges as directed by CFTC, (c) imposing new and potentially higher capital and margin requirements on swap dealers and traders who hold significant positions in swaps and (d) increasing the monitoring and compliance obligations of parties who engage in swaps, including new recordkeeping and reporting requirements with governmental entities.  The CFTC has issued regulations exempting certain end users of energy commodities from being required to clear OTC derivatives, provided that they (a) are using the swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk and (b) satisfy certain other requirements.  To the extent we meet such requirements, the end user exemption could reduce the effect of the law's clearing requirements on our hedging activity.  Pursuant to authority granted under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC has also issued rules that, among other things, further define the OTC derivative products and entities subject to additional regulatory oversight, which recently became effective.  These requirements could subject us to additional regulatory oversight related to our OTC derivative transactions, cause our OTC derivative transactions to be more costly and have an impact on financial condition due to additional capital requirements.  In addition, as these reforms aim to standardize OTC products it could limit the effectiveness of our hedging programs because we would have less ability to tailor OTC derivatives to match the precise risk we are seeking to manage.  44 "
1,AEP,AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER CO,2013-02-26,"ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORSGENERAL RISKS OF OUR REGULATED OPERATIONSWe may not be able to recover the costs of our substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions. – Affecting each RegistrantOur business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits, construction of additional transmission facilities, modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives.  Our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions.  If these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates we charge, we would not be able to recover the costs associated with our planned extensive investment.  This would cause our financial results to be diminished.  While we may seek to limit the impact of any denied recovery by attempting to reduce the scope of our capital investment, there can be no assurance as to the effectiveness of any such mitigation efforts, particularly with respect to previously incurred costs and commitments.Approval of the new ESP order in Ohio may be overturned. – Affecting AEP and OPCoIn August 2012, the PUCO issued an order which adopted and modified a new ESP through May 2015.  The ESP allowed the continuation of the fuel adjustment clause and established a non-bypassable Distribution Investment Rider effective September 2012 through May 2015 to recover, with certain caps, post-August 2010 distribution investment.  The ESP also maintained recovery of several previous ESP riders and approved a storm damage recovery mechanism which allowed OPCo to defer the majority of the incremental distribution operation and maintenance costs from 2012 storms.    In January 2013, the PUCO issued its Order on Rehearing for the ESP which generally upheld its August 2012 order.  The PUCO addressed certain issues around the energy auctions while other SSO issues were deferred to a separate docket.  Comments on the rehearing order are permitted to be filed by intervenors through March 2013.  If the PUCO reverses all or part of the ESP rehearing order, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.We may not fully collect deferred capacity costs. – Affecting AEP and OPCoThe PUCO adopted and modified the new ESP and established a non-bypassable Retail Stability Rider (RSR).  A portion of the RSR provides for the collection of deferred capacity costs.  The deferred capacity costs may exceed the amount we will collect under the RSR.  In addition, the Industrial Energy Users-Ohio filed a claim before the Supreme Court of Ohio stating, among other things, that OPCo’s recovery of its capacity costs is illegal.  If OPCo is ultimately not permitted to fully collect its deferred capacity costs, it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.We may not recover deferred fuel costs. – Affecting AEP and OPCoIn August 2012, the PUCO ordered recovery of deferred fuel costs beginning September 2012 through the Phase-In Recovery Rider.  The August 2012 order was upheld by the PUCO in October 2012.  OPCo and intervenors have filed appeals at the Supreme Court of Ohio.  If the Supreme Court of Ohio does not permit full recovery of OPCo’s deferred fuel costs, it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.Prior ESP rate recovery approved in Ohio may have to be returned, may not provide full recovery of costs and is subject to appeal. – Affecting AEP and OPCoThe PUCO issued an order in March 2009 that modified and approved the prior ESP which established rates through 2011.  The prior ESP order generally authorized rate increases during the ESP period, subject to caps that limited the rate increases, and also provided a fuel adjustment clause for the three-year period of that ESP.  There remain three risks associated with this prior approved recovery:  (a) amounts collected by us for the years 2010 and 2011 are subject to an excessive earnings test administered by the PUCO, which could require us to refund amounts to customers, (b) the recovery under the fuel adjustment clause includes significant deferrals of costs associated with an interim arrangement with a major steel producing customer and is subject to the PUCO’s ultimate decision regarding those deferrals plus related carrying charges, and (c) intervenors are challenging various issues at the Supreme Court of Ohio, asserting that charges that the PUCO reversed going forward also should have been  27  reversed retrospectively and challenging various aspects of approved environmental carrying charges.  If the PUCO and/or the Supreme Court of Ohio reverses all or part of the rate recovery or if deferred amounts are not recovered for other reasons, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.Ohio may require us to refund additional fuel costs. – Affecting AEP and OPCoIn January 2012, the PUCO ordered that proceeds from a 2008 coal contract settlement agreement be applied against OPCo’s under-recovered fuel balance and that an outside consultant be hired to review our fuel procurement through 2011.  The audit by the outside consultant included recommendations that would limit some of our fuel recovery or require us to refund certain fuel costs already incurred.  In addition, an intervenor filed a claim for refund of certain fuel costs with the Supreme Court of Ohio.   If the PUCO orders result in a reduction to our fuel recovery and/or the Supreme Court of Ohio ultimately determines to grant all or part of the requested refund, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.We may not fully recover all of the investment in and expenses related to the Turk Plant – Affecting AEP and SWEPCoIn December 2012, SWEPCo placed the Turk Plant in Arkansas into commercial operation.  SWEPCo holds a 73% ownership interest in the 600 MW coal-fired generating facility.  SWEPCo had originally intended that 88 MW of the Turk Plant would become part of the rate base for its retail customers in Arkansas.  Following a proceeding at the Arkansas Supreme Court, the APSC issued an order which reversed and set aside a previously granted Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Need.  This portion of the Turk Plant output is currently not subject to cost based rate recovery and is being sold into the SPP market.  SWEPCo has included a request to recover a portion of the costs of the Turk Plant in its base rate case filed in Texas and has made a formula rate filing with the LPSC, and a subsequent settlement seeking recovery for a portion of the costs of the Turk Plant.  If SWEPCo cannot recover all of its investment and expenses related to the Turk Plant either through retail rates or sales into the SPP market, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.We may not fully recover all of the investment in and expenses related to extending the useful life of the Cook Plant – Affecting AEP and I&MIn April and May 2012, I&M filed a petition with the IURC and the MPSC, respectively, for approval of the Cook Plant Life Cycle Management Project (LCM Project), which consists of a group of capital projects for Cook Plant Units 1 and 2 intended to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the plant through its licensed life.  The estimated cost of the LCM Project is $1.2 billion to be incurred through 2018, excluding AFUDC.  As of December 31, 2012, I&M has incurred $176 million related to the LCM Project, including AFUDC.  If I&M is not ultimately permitted to recover its LCM Project costs, it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.Request for rate recovery in Texas may not be approved in its entirety. – Affecting AEP and SWEPCoIn July 2012, SWEPCo filed a request with the PUCT for an annual increase in Texas base rates.  A portion of the increase seeks recovery for costs associated with the construction and operation of the Texas jurisdictional share (approximately 33%) of the Turk Plant.  In April 2012, the Texas Industrial Energy Consumers filed a petition for review at the Supreme Court of Texas contending that the Turk Plant is unnecessary to serve retail customers.  The Supreme Court of Texas has requested full briefing from the parties.  If SWEPCo cannot recover all of its investment and expenses related to the Turk Plant, it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.Our transmission investment strategy and execution bears certain risks associated with these activities. – Affecting AEPWe expect that a growing portion of our earnings in the future will derive from the transmission investments and activities of AEPTCo and our transmission joint ventures.  FERC policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction.  If FERC were to adopt a different policy or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected, our strategy of investing in transmission could be curtailed.  We believe our experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives us an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install, construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities.  28  However, there can be no assurance that PJM, SPP or other RTOs will authorize any new transmission projects or will award any such projects to us.  If the FERC were to lower the rate of return it has authorized for our transmission investments and facilities, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.We may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled. – Affecting each RegistrantOur business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks, including construction delays, nonperformance by equipment and other third party suppliers, and increases in equipment and labor costs.  To limit the risks of these construction projects, we enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits.  If any of these projects is canceled for any reason, including our failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits, we could incur significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts.  In addition, if we have recorded any construction work or investments as an asset we may need to impair that asset in the event the project is canceled.Rate regulation may delay or deny full recovery of capital improvements, additions, storm damage operations and maintenance expense repairs and other costs. – Affecting each RegistrantOur public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions.  These rates are generally regulated based on an analysis of the applicable utility’s expenses incurred in a test year.  Thus, commission-approved rates may or may not match a utility’s expenses at any given time.  There may also be a delay between the timing of when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered.  Traditionally, we have financed capital investments and improvements until the new asset was placed in service.  Provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment, the asset was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery.  Similarly, we often finance the operations and maintenance expense to repair facilities damaged by storms or other severe weather events until the operations and maintenance storm costs, including any deferred regulatory assets, are recovered in rates. Long lead times in construction and scheduled repairs, the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets have heightened the risks involved in our capital investments, repairs and improvements.  While we are actively pursuing strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow, including pre-approvals, a return on construction work in progress, rider/trackers, formula rates and the inclusion of future test-year projections into rates, there can be no assurance that these will be adopted, that the applicable regulatory commission will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will be done in a timely manner.Certain of our revenues and results of operations are subject to risks that are beyond our control. – Affecting each RegistrantOur operations are structured to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations and we take measures to minimize the risk of significant disruptions. Material disruptions at one or more of our operational facilities, however, could negatively impact our revenues, operating and capital expenditures and results of operations.  Such events may also create additional risks related to the supply and/or cost of equipment and materials.  We could experience unexpected but significant interruption due to several events, including, but not limited to:·  Major facility or equipment failure.·  An environmental event such as a serious spill or release.·  Fires, floods, droughts, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados or other natural disasters.·  Wars, terrorist acts (including cyber-terrorism) or threats and other catastrophic events.·  Significant health impairments or disease events.·  Other serious operational problems.  29  We are exposed to nuclear generation risk. – Affecting AEP and I&MThrough I&M, we own the Cook Plant.  It consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2,191 MW, or about 6% of the generating capacity in the AEP System.  We are, therefore, subject to the risks of nuclear generation, which include the following:·  The potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials such as spent nuclear fuel.·  Limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with our nuclear operations.·  Uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts triggered by a loss event (federal law requires owners of nuclear units to purchase the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance and potentially contribute to the losses of others).·  Uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives.There can be no assurance that I&M’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if and when these risks are triggered.The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities.  In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants such as ours.  In addition, although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our plants, if an incident did occur, it could harm our results of operations or financial condition.  A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.  Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S. could require us to make material contributory payments.Costs associated with the operation (including fuel), maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation, in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards, availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities.  Costs also may include replacement power, any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the Cook Plant (whether scheduled or premature), the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs.  Our ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the Cook Plant is not assured.The different regional power markets in which we compete or will compete in the future have changing market and transmission structures, which could affect our performance in these regions. – Affecting each RegistrantOur results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets.  The rules governing the various regional power markets, including SPP and PJM, may also change from time to time which could affect our costs or revenues.  Because the manner in which RTOs will evolve remains unclear, we are unable to assess fully the impact that changes in these power markets may have on our business.We could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards. – Affecting each RegistrantAs a result of EPACT, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by the FERC.  These standards, which previously were being applied on a voluntary basis, became mandatory in June 2007.  The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles. Compliance with new reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures.  While we expect to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates, there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner.  If we were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates.  30  RISKS RELATED TO MARKET, ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL VOLATILITY AND OTHER RISKSOur financial performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions. – Affecting each RegistrantOur performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of our generation, transmission and distribution facilities.  Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:·  Operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes.·  Operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements.·  Labor disputes.·  Compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards.·  Information technology failure that impairs our information technology infrastructure or disrupts normal business operations.·  Information technology failure that affects our ability to access customer information or causes us to lose confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects our reputation or exposes us to legal claims.·  Fuel or water supply interruptions caused by transportation constraints, adverse weather such as drought, non-performance by our suppliers and other factors.·  Catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, hurricanes, tornados, ice storms, terrorism (including cyber-terrorism), floods or other similar occurrences.Hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair our operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information and damage our reputation. – Affecting each RegistrantWe own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems. Further, the computer systems that run our facilities are not completely isolated from external networks. Parties that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system or our operations could view our computer systems, software or networks as attractive targets for cyber attack. In addition, our business requires that we collect and maintain sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss.A successful cyber attack on the systems that control our generation, transmission, distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing us from serving customers or collecting revenues. The breach of certain business systems could affect our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to our reputation. In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring.  We maintain property and casualty insurance that may cover certain physical damage or third party injuries caused by potential cybersecurity incidents.  However, other damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available.  For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.In an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber intrusions, we have a comprehensive cybersecurity program designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and systems. In addition, we are subject to mandatory cybersecurity regulatory requirements. However, cyber threats continue to evolve and adapt, and, as a result, there is a risk that we could experience a successful cyber attack despite our current security posture and regulatory compliance efforts.  31  If we are unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. – Affecting each RegistrantWe rely on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows.  Volatility and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect our ability to raise capital and fund our capital needs, including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness.  In addition, if capital is available only on less than reasonable terms or to borrowers whose creditworthiness is better than ours, capital costs could increase materially.  Restricted access to capital markets and/or increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.Downgrades in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital and/or to operate our power trading businesses. – Affecting each RegistrantThe credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings.  Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to us and could limit our access to funding for our operations.  Our business is capital intensive, and we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive.  In periods of market turmoil, access to capital is difficult for all borrowers.  If our ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained, our interest costs will likely increase and could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.Our power trading business relies on the investment grade ratings of our individual public utility subsidiaries’ senior unsecured long-term debt or on the investment grade ratings of AEP parent.  Most of our counterparties require the creditworthiness of an investment grade entity to stand behind transactions.  If those ratings were to decline below investment grade, our ability to operate our power trading business profitably would be diminished because we would likely have to deposit cash or cash-related instruments which would reduce our profits.AEP has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other obligations due it from its subsidiaries. – Affecting AEPAEP is a holding company and has no operations of its own.  Its ability to meet its financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries, primarily its regulated utilities, and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to, or repay loans from, AEP.  Its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation (apart from loans from AEP) to provide AEP with funds for its payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions or other payments.  Payments to AEP by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations.  In addition, any payment of dividends, distributions or advances by the utility subsidiaries to AEP could be subject to regulatory restrictions.  AEP indebtedness and common stock dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness and preferred stock obligations, if any.Our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions. – Affecting each RegistrantElectric power generation is generally a seasonal business.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter.  As a result, our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the terms of power sale contracts that we enter into.  In addition, we have historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder.  Unusually mild weather in the future could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition.  Conversely, unusually extreme weather conditions could increase AEP’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable.Further, deteriorating economic conditions generally result in reduced consumption by our customers, particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely, while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues.  As a result, our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate on the basis of prevailing economic conditions.  32  Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm our results of operations. – Affecting each RegistrantCertain events, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs.  The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development.  In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise.  Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business.  If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our results of operations could be negatively affected.Parties we have engaged to provide construction materials or services may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm our results of operations. – Affecting each RegistrantOur business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades, construction of additional generation units and transmission facilities as well as other initiatives.  We are exposed to the risk of substantial price increases in the costs of materials used in construction.  We have engaged numerous contractors and entered into a large number of agreements to acquire the necessary materials and/or obtain the required construction related services.  As a result, we are also exposed to the risk that these contractors and other counterparties could breach their obligations to us.  Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current market prices that may exceed our contractual prices and almost certainly cause delays in that and related projects.  Although our agreements are designed to mitigate the consequences of a potential default by the counterparty, our actual exposure may be greater than these mitigation provisions.  This would cause our financial results to be diminished, and we might incur losses or delays in completing construction.Changes in commodity prices and the costs of transport may increase our cost of producing power or decrease the amount we receive from selling power, harming our financial performance. – Affecting each RegistrantWe are exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal and the price and availability to transport coal because most of our generating capacity is coal-fired.  We have contracts of varying durations for the supply of coal for most of our existing generation capacity, but as these contracts end or otherwise are not honored, we may not be able to purchase coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts.  Similarly, we are exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances.  We use emission allowances based on the amount of coal we use as fuel and the reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures.   As long as current environmental programs remain in effect, we have sufficient emission allowances to cover the majority of our projected needs for the next two years and beyond.  If the Federal EPA is able to create a replacement rule to reduce interstate transport, and it is acceptable by the courts, additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions.  If we need to obtain allowances under a replacement rule, those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs.  Our risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge.We also own natural gas-fired facilities which exposes us to market prices of natural gas.  Historically, natural gas prices have tended to be more volatile than prices for other fuel sources. Recently however, the availability of natural gas from shale production has lessened price volatility. Our ability to make off-system sales at a profit is highly dependent on the price of natural gas.  As the price of natural gas falls, other market participants that utilize natural gas-fired generation will be able to offer electricity at increasingly competitive prices relative to our off-system sales prices, so the margins we realize from sales will be lower and, on occasion, we may need to curtail operation of marginal plants.  We expect the availability of shale natural gas and issues related to its accessibility will have a long-term material effect on the price and volatility of natural gas.Prices for coal, natural gas and emission allowances have shown material upward and downward swings in the past.  Changes in the cost of coal, emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power will affect our financial results.  33  In addition, actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value our trading and marketing transactions, and those differences may be material.  As a result, our financial results may be diminished in the future as those transactions are marked to market.Our AEP River Operations business segment cannot operate if river levels are too low or too high. – Affecting AEPOur AEP River Operations business segment transports coal and dry bulk commodities primarily on the Ohio, Illinois and lower Mississippi rivers.  If drought conditions or other factors cause the water levels of one or more of these rivers to drop below the amount necessary to permit commercial barging traffic, it would prevent our AEP River Operations from transporting cargo on the affected river.  Conversely, if unusually high amounts of precipitation or other factors cause the water levels of one or more of these rivers to be too high to permit commercial barging traffic, it would prevent our AEP River Operations from transporting cargo on the affected river.   Extreme water levels that do not close river basin commercial traffic can still harm our business if the levels curtail the total volume permitted to move on the affected river. The levels on portions of the Mississippi River in 2013 have been reported as the lowest since the levels caused by severe drought in 1988.  Any reduction in the commercial activities of our AEP River Operations due to low water levels could reduce future net income and cash flows.RISKS RELATING TO STATE RESTRUCTURINGWe are unable to fully predict the effects of corporate separation in Ohio and Ohio generation becoming subject to market forces. – Affecting AEP and OPCoWhile Ohio rates for transmission and distribution services continue to be established using a more traditional cost-based method, in October 2012, the PUCO approved OPCo’s corporate separation plan to transfer its generation assets to a new competitive, unregulated generation affiliate.  During this transition, generation rates will be priced using a hybrid approach that incorporates components of cost and market.  Starting in mid-2015, generation rates will be subject entirely to market prices. We have made additional filings at the FERC and other state commissions related to this corporate separation.  If all regulatory approvals are received, our results of operations related to generation previously held by OPCo will be largely determined by the prevailing market conditions.  We can give no assurance that the FERC will not impose material adverse terms as a condition to approving our corporate separation filings.  Additionally, some of these generation units may no longer be cost effective and may be retired prior to the end of their anticipated useful life.  This could result in material impairments.We are unable to fully predict the effects of terminating the Interconnection Agreement. – Affecting AEP, APCo, I&M and OPCoIn October 2012, we submitted several filings with the FERC seeking approval to fully separate OPCo’s generating assets from its distribution and transmission operations.  The filings requested approval to transfer approximately 9,200 MW of OPCo-owned generation assets to a new competitive, unregulated generation affiliate.  We also requested approval from the FERC and, as applicable, the KPSC, the Virginia SCC and the WVPSC to transfer 1,647 MW of OPCo-owned generation assets to APCo and 780 MW of OPCo-owned generation assets to KPCo.  Additionally, we asked for FERC approval to terminate the existing Interconnection Agreement and to authorize a new Power Coordination Agreement among APCo, I&M and KPCo.  A decision from the FERC is expected in mid-2013.  Significant gaps could emerge if the Interconnection Agreement is terminated without approval of the generation asset transfers and/or the new Power Coordination Agreement.  Surplus members would no longer automatically sell to deficit members, and they may not be able to otherwise sell that surplus in amounts or at rates equal to what they obtained under the Interconnection Agreement.  Conversely, deficit members would no longer automatically purchase from surplus members, and they may not be able to otherwise purchase in amounts or at rates equal to what they obtained under the Interconnection Agreement.  The possible loss of these sales by the surplus members and the potential increase in costs for the deficit members could reduce future net income and cash flows.  In addition, we can give no assurance that the FERC or other state commissions will not impose material adverse terms as a condition to approving these arrangements and asset transfers.  34  Customers are choosing alternative electric generation service providers, as allowed by Ohio law and regulation. – Affecting AEP and OPCoUnder current Ohio law, electric generation is sold in a competitive market in Ohio and native load customers in Ohio have the ability to switch to alternative suppliers for their electric generation service.  CRES providers are targeting retail customers by offering alternative generation service.  As of December 31, 2012, based upon an average annual load, approximately 51% of our Ohio load had switched to CRES providers.  These evolving market conditions will continue to impact our results of operations.Collection of our revenues in Texas is concentrated in a limited number of REPs. – Affecting AEPOur revenues from the distribution of electricity in the ERCOT area of Texas are collected from REPs that supply the electricity we distribute to their customers.  Currently, we do business with approximately one hundred REPs.  In 2012, TCC’s largest REP accounted for 16% of its operating revenue and its second largest REP accounted for 7% of its operating revenue; TNC’s largest REP accounted for 19% of its operating revenues and its second largest REP accounted for 12% of its operating revenues.  Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the Texas market or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for our services or could cause them to delay such payments.  We depend on these REPs for timely remittance of payments.  Any delay or default in payment could reduce future cash flows and impact financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO OWNING AND OPERATING GENERATION ASSETS AND SELLING POWEROur costs of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant. – Affecting each RegistrantOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety.  Approximately 90% of the electricity generated by the AEP System is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels.  Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury and particulates from fossil fueled generating plants are subject to increased regulations, controls and mitigation expenses.  Compliance with these legal requirements requires us to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees and permits at all of our facilities and could cause us to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.  These expenditures have been significant in the past and we expect that they will continue to be significant in order to comply with the current and proposed regulations.  Costs of compliance with environmental regulations could reduce future net income and impact financial condition, especially if emission and/or discharge limits are tightened, more extensive permitting requirements are imposed, additional substances become regulated and the number and types of assets we operate increase.  If we retire generating plants prior to the end of their estimated useful life, there can be no assurance that we will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants.  While we expect to recover our expenditures for pollution control technologies, replacement generation and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates (in regulated jurisdictions) or market prices, without such recovery those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and possibly harm our financial condition.Regulation of CO2 emissions, either through legislation or by the Federal EPA, could materially increase costs to us and our customers or cause some of our electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain. – Affecting each RegistrantThe U.S. Congress has not taken any significant steps toward enacting legislation to control CO2 emissions since 2009.  In December 2009, the Federal EPA issued a final endangerment finding under the CAA regarding emissions from motor vehicles.  The Federal EPA also finalized CO2 emission standards for new motor vehicles, and issued a rule that implements a permitting program for new and modified stationary sources of CO2 emissions in a phased manner through 2014.  Several groups have filed challenges to the endangerment finding and the Federal EPA’s subsequent rulemakings.  In 2012, the Federal EPA issued a proposed CO2 emissions standard for new power generation sources with a CO2 limit equivalent to a natural gas unit.  A final rule is expected in the first half of 2013.  Management believes some policy approaches being discussed would have significant and widespread negative consequences for the national economy and major U.S. Industrial enterprises, including us and our customers.  35  If CO2 and other emission standards are imposed, the standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs which would impact the ultimate retirement of older, less-efficient, coal-fired units.  While we expect that costs of complying with new CO2 and other greenhouse gases emission standards will be treated like all other reasonable costs of serving customers and should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business, without such recovery those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and harm our financial condition.Courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims against us may order us to pay damages or to limit or reduce our CO2 emissions. – Affecting each RegistrantIn the past there have been several cases, and currently there is one pending case, seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which we, among others, are defendants.  In general, the actions allege that CO2 emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance due to impacts of global warming and climate change.  The plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief.  If the pending or other future actions are resolved against us, substantial modifications of our existing coal-fired power plants could be required and we might be required to limit or reduce CO2 emissions.  Such remedies could require us to purchase power from third parties to fulfill our commitments to supply power to our customers.  This could have a material impact on our costs.  In addition, we could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment, accelerate the timing of capital expenditures, pay damages or penalties and/or halt operations.  While management believes such costs should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business in our jurisdictions where generation rates are set on a cost of service basis, without such recovery those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and harm our financial condition.  Moreover, our results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation.Our revenues and results of operations from selling power are subject to market risks that are beyond our control. – Affecting each RegistrantWe sell power from our generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis.  We also enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity, natural gas, emission allowances and coal as part of our power marketing and energy trading operations.  With respect to such transactions, the rate of return on our capital investments is not determined through mandated rates, and our revenues and results of operations are likely to depend, in large part, upon prevailing market prices for power in our regional markets and other competitive markets.  These market prices can fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time.  Trading margins may erode as markets mature and there may be diminished opportunities for gain should volatility decline.  In addition, the FERC, which has jurisdiction over wholesale power rates, as well as RTOs that oversee some of these markets, may impose price limitations, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets.  Power supply and other similar agreements entered into during extreme market conditions may subsequently be held to be unenforceable by a reviewing court or the FERC.  Fuel and emissions prices may also be volatile, and the price we can obtain for power sales may not change at the same rate as changes in fuel and/or emissions costs.  These factors could reduce our margins and therefore diminish our revenues and results of operations.  Volatility in market prices for fuel and power may result from:·  Weather conditions, including storms.·  Economic conditions.·  Outages of major generation or transmission facilities.·  Seasonality.·  Power usage.·  Illiquid markets.·  Transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies.·  Availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources.·  Demand for energy commodities.·  Natural gas, crude oil and refined products and coal production levels.·  Natural disasters, wars, embargoes and other catastrophic events.·  Federal, state and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation.  36  Our power trading (including coal, gas and emission allowances trading and power marketing) and risk management policies cannot eliminate the risk associated with these activities. – Affecting each RegistrantOur power trading (including coal, gas and emission allowances trading and power marketing) activities expose us to risks of commodity price movements.  We attempt to manage our exposure by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management procedures.  These risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate the risks associated with these activities.  As a result, we cannot predict the impact that our energy trading and risk management decisions may have on our business, operating results or financial position.We routinely have open trading positions in the market, within guidelines we set, resulting from the management of our trading portfolio.  To the extent open trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results and financial position.Our power trading and risk management activities, including our power sales agreements with counterparties, rely on projections that depend heavily on judgments and assumptions by management of factors such as the future market prices and demand for power and other energy-related commodities.  These factors become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future these estimates are made.  Even when our policies and procedures are followed and decisions are made based on these estimates, results of operations may be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those calculations prove to be inaccurate.Parties with whom we have contracts may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm our results of operations. – Affecting each RegistrantWe are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe us money or power could breach their obligations.  Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at then-current market prices that may exceed our contractual prices, which would cause our financial results to be diminished and we might incur losses.  Although our estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty, our actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict.We rely on electric transmission facilities that we do not own or control.  If these facilities do not provide us with adequate transmission capacity, we may not be able to deliver our wholesale electric power to the purchasers of our power. – Affecting each RegistrantWe depend on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power we sell at wholesale.  This dependence exposes us to a variety of risks.  If transmission is disrupted, or transmission capacity is inadequate, we may not be able to sell and deliver our wholesale power.  If a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, our recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited.  If restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure.The FERC has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales.  Although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions for electricity and gas, access to transmission systems may in fact not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable.  We also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets.We do not fully hedge against price changes in commodities. – Affecting each RegistrantWe routinely enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity, natural gas, coal and emission allowances as part of our power marketing and energy and emission allowances trading operations.  In connection with these trading activities, we routinely enter into financial contracts, including futures and options, over-the counter options, financially-settled swaps and other derivative contracts.  These activities expose us to risks from price movements.  If the values of the financial contracts change in a manner we do not anticipate, it could harm our financial position or reduce the financial contribution of our trading operations.  37  We manage our exposure by establishing risk limits and entering into contracts to offset some of our positions (i.e., to hedge our exposure to demand, market effects of weather and other changes in commodity prices).  However, we do not always hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility.  To the extent we do not hedge against commodity price volatility, our results of operations and financial position may be improved or diminished based upon our success in the market.Financial derivatives reforms could increase the liquidity needs and costs of our commercial trading operations. – Affecting each RegistrantIn July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law (Dodd-Frank Act).  The federal legislation was enacted to reform financial markets and significantly alter how over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives are regulated.  The law increased regulatory oversight of OTC energy derivatives, including: (a) imposing pervasive regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on dealers and traders who hold significant positions in swaps, (b) requiring certain standardized OTC derivatives to be traded on registered exchanges as directed by CFTC, (c) imposing new and potentially higher capital and margin requirements on swap dealers and traders who hold significant positions in swaps and (d) increasing the monitoring and compliance obligations of parties who engage in swaps, including new recordkeeping and reporting requirements with governmental entities.  The CFTC has issued regulations exempting certain end users of energy commodities from being required to clear OTC derivatives, provided that they (a) are using the swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk and (b) satisfy certain other requirements.  To the extent we meet such requirements, the end user exemption could reduce the effect of the law's clearing requirements on our hedging activity.  Pursuant to authority granted under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC has also issued rules that, among other things, further define the OTC derivative products and entities subject to additional regulatory oversight, which recently became effective.  These requirements could subject us to additional regulatory oversight related to our OTC derivative transactions, cause our OTC derivative transactions to be more costly and have an impact on financial condition due to additional capital requirements.  In addition, as these reforms aim to standardize OTC products it could limit the effectiveness of our hedging programs because we would have less ability to tailor OTC derivatives to match the precise risk we are seeking to manage.  38 "
0,AEP,AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER CO,2012-02-28,"ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORSGENERAL RISKS OF OUR REGULATED OPERATIONS The regulatory environment in Ohio has recently become unpredictable and increasingly uncertain. – Affecting AEP and OPCoFor some time, our retail sales of electricity in Ohio have accounted for approximately 30% of our utilities segment revenue.  Due to a number of reasons, including commission turnover and a renewed emphasis on deregulation, the regulatory environment in Ohio has become increasingly unpredictable.  The current regulatory environment in Ohio could result in an extended period of uncertainty and cause our financial performance in Ohio to be volatile and difficult to project.We may not be able to recover the costs of our substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions. – Affecting each RegistrantOur business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits, construction and/or acquisition of additional generation units and transmission facilities, modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives.  Our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions.  If these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates we charge, we would not be able to recover the costs associated with our planned extensive investment.  This would cause our financial results to be diminished.  While we may seek to limit the impact of any denied recovery by attempting to reduce the scope of our capital investment, there can be no assurance as to the effectiveness of any such mitigation efforts, particularly with respect to previously incurred costs and commitments.Rate and other recovery in Ohio for distribution service may not provide full recovery of costs. – Affecting AEP and OPCoIn February 2011, OPCo filed with the PUCO for an annual increase in distribution rates.  In December 2011, a stipulation agreement was approved by the PUCO providing recovery of certain distribution regulatory assets.  Due to a February 2012 PUCO ESP rehearing order, which rejected the ESP modified stipulation, collection of the Distribution Investment Rider terminated.  If OPCo is not ultimately permitted to fully recover its deferrals and costs, it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.Rate recovery in Ohio for generation service may not provide full recovery of costs. – Affecting AEP and OPCoIn January 2011, OPCo filed an application with the PUCO to approve a new ESP that included a standard service offer pricing for generation.  In December 2011, a modified stipulation agreement was approved by the PUCO which involved various issues pending before the PUCO, including generation rates and the recovery of fuel costs.  In February 2012, the PUCO issued an entry on rehearing which rejected the ESP approved modified stipulation and ordered a return to the 2011 ESP rates until a new rate plan is approved.  Under the February 2012 rehearing order, OPCo has 30 days to notify the PUCO whether it plans to modify or withdraw its original application as filed in January 2011.  Management is currently evaluating its options and the potential financial and operational impacts on OPCo.  If OPCo is not ultimately permitted to fully recover its costs, it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.Rate recovery approved in Ohio may have to be returned and/or may not provide full recovery of costs. – Affecting AEP and OPCoThe PUCO issued an order in March 2009 that modified and approved the Electric Security Plan (ESP) which established rates through 2011.  The ESP order generally authorized rate increases during the ESP period, subject to caps that limit the rate increases, and also provides a fuel adjustment clause for the three-year period of the ESP.  The recovery under the fuel adjustment clause includes deferrals associated with the Ormet interim arrangement and is subject to the PUCO’s ultimate decision regarding the Ormet interim arrangement deferrals plus related carrying charges.  In July 2011, OPCo filed its 2010 SEET filing with the PUCO.  If the PUCO and/or the Supreme Court of Ohio reverses all or part of the rate recovery or if deferred fuel costs are not fully recovered for other reasons, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  26   Oklahoma may require us to refund fuel costs that we have collected. – Affecting PSO In July 2009, the OCC initiated a proceeding to review PSO’s fuel and purchased power adjustment clause for the calendar year 2008 and also initiated a prudence review of the related costs.  In March 2010, the Oklahoma Attorney General and an intervenor recommended the fuel clause adjustment rider be amended to decrease the shareholder’s portion of off-system sales margins from 25% to 10%.  That intervenor also recommended that the OCC conduct a comprehensive review of all affiliate fuel transactions during 2007 and 2008.  In July 2010, additional testimony regarding the 2007 transfer of ERCOT trading contracts to AEP Energy Partners was filed.  Included in this testimony were unquantified refund recommendations relating to re-pricing of contract transactions.  If the OCC were to issue an unfavorable decision, it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. We may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled. – Affecting each RegistrantOur business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks, including construction delays, nonperformance by equipment and other third party suppliers, and increases in equipment and labor costs.  To limit the risks of these construction projects, we enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits.  If any of these projects is canceled for any reason, including our failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits, we could incur significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts.  In addition, if we have recorded any construction work or investments as a regulatory asset we may need to impair that asset in the event the project is canceled.Rate regulation may delay or deny full recovery of capital improvements, additions and other costs. – Affecting each RegistrantOur public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions.  These rates are generally regulated based on an analysis of the applicable utility’s expenses incurred in a test year.  Thus, commission-approved rates may or may not match a utility’s expenses at any given time.  There may also be a delay between the timing of when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered.  Traditionally, we have financed capital investments and improvements until the new asset was placed in service.  Provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment, the asset was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery.  Long lead times in construction, the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets have heightened the risks involved in our capital investments and improvements.  While we are actively pursuing strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow, including pre-approvals, a return on construction work in progress, rider/trackers, formula rates and the inclusion of future test-year projections into rates, there can be no assurance that these will be adopted, that the applicable regulatory commission will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will be done in a timely manner.   27    Certain of our revenues and results of operations are subject to risks that are beyond our control. – Affecting each RegistrantOur operations are structured to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations and we take measures to minimize the risk of significant disruptions.  Material disruptions at one or more of our operational facilities, however, could negatively impact our revenues, operating and capital expenditures and results of operations.  Such events may also create additional risks related to the supply and/or cost of equipment and materials.  We could experience unexpected but significant interruption due to several events, including, but not limited to:·    Major facility or equipment failure.·    An environmental event such as a serious spill or release.·    Fires, floods, droughts, earthquakes, hurricanes or other natural disasters.·    Wars, terrorist acts (including cyber-terrorism) or threats and other catastrophic events.·    Significant health impairments or disease events.·    Other serious operational problems.We are exposed to nuclear generation risk. – Affecting AEP and I&MThrough I&M, we own the Cook Plant.  It consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2,191 MW, or 8-9% of the electricity generated by the AEP System.  We are, therefore, subject to the risks of nuclear generation, which include the following:·    The potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials such as spent nuclear fuel.·    Limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with our nuclear operations.·    Uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts if insurance coverage is inadequate (federal law requires owners of nuclear units to purchase the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance and potentially contribute to the losses of others).·    Uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives.There can be no assurance that I&M’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if and when these risks are triggered.The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities.  In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants such as ours.  In addition, although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our plants, if an incident did occur, it could harm our results of operations or financial condition.  A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.  Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S. could require us to make material contributory payments.Costs associated with the operation (including fuel), maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation, in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards, availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities.  Costs also may include replacement power, any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the Cook Plant (whether scheduled or premature), the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs.  Our ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the Cook Plant is not assured.  28   As a result of the nuclear plant situation in Japan following a March 2011 earthquake, the NRC has initiated a review of safety procedures and requirements for nuclear generating facilities.  This review could increase procedures and testing requirements, require physical modifications to the plant and increase future operating costs at the Cook Plant.  In addition to the review by the NRC, Congress could consider legislation tightening oversight of nuclear generating facilities.  We are unable to predict the impact of potential future regulation of nuclear facilities.The different regional power markets in which we compete or will compete in the future have changing market and transmission structures, which could affect our performance in these regions. – Affecting each RegistrantOur results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets.  The rules governing the various regional power markets, including SPP and PJM, may also change from time to time which could affect our costs or revenues.  Because the manner in which RTOs will evolve remains unclear, we are unable to assess fully the impact that changes in these power markets may have on our business. The amount we charged third parties for using our transmission facilities is subject to refund. – Affecting each RegistrantIn July 2003, the FERC issued an order directing PJM and MISO to make compliance filings for their respective tariffs to eliminate the transaction-based charges for through and out (T&O) transmission service on transactions where the energy is delivered within those RTOs.  To mitigate the impact of lost T&O revenues, the FERC approved temporary replacement seams elimination cost allocation (SECA) transition rates beginning in December 2004 and extending through March 2006.  Because intervenors objected to this decision, the SECA fees we collected ($220 million) are subject to refund.  Some claims for refund have been settled, and we have recorded a provision for estimated settlement refunds for the remaining unsettled $108 million of gross SECA revenues collected.  Any payments in excess of the reserve balance could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.We could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards. – Affecting each RegistrantAs a result of EPACT, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by the FERC.  These standards, which previously were being applied on a voluntary basis, became mandatory in June 2007.  The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles.  Compliance with new reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures.  While we expect to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates, there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner.  If we were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates.At times, demand for power could exceed our supply capacity. – Affecting each RegistrantWe are currently obligated to supply power in parts of eleven states.  From time to time, because of unforeseen circumstances, the demand for power required to meet these obligations could exceed our available generation capacity.  If this occurs, we would have to buy power from the market.  This would increase the pressure on our short-term debt financing capacity in times of tight liquidity.  We may not always have the ability to pass these costs on to our customers, and the time lag between incurring costs and recovery can be long.  Since these situations most often occur during periods of peak demand, it is possible that the market price for power at that time would be very high.  Even if a supply shortage were brief, we could suffer substantial losses that could reduce our results of operations.  29  RISKS RELATED TO MARKET, ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL VOLATILITY AND OTHER RISKSOur financial performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions. – Affecting each RegistrantOur performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of our generation, transmission and distribution facilities.  Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:·  Operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes.·  Operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements.·  Labor disputes.·  Compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards.·  Information technology failure that impairs our information technology infrastructure or disrupts normal business operations.·  Information technology failure that affects our ability to access customer information or causes us to lose confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects our reputation or exposes us to legal claims.·  Fuel or water supply interruptions caused by transportation constraints, adverse weather such as drought, non-performance by our suppliers and other factors.·  Catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, hurricanes, terrorism (including cyber-terrorism), floods or other similar occurrences.We may be subject to disruptions or failures in our information technology systems and network infrastructures that could have a material adverse effect on us. – Affecting each RegistrantWe maintain and rely extensively on information technology systems and network infrastructures for the effective operation of our business.  We also hold large amounts of data in various data center facilities which our business depends upon.  A disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems or any of our data centers as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber attacks, employee theft or misuse, power disruptions, natural disasters or accidents could cause breaches of data security and loss of critical data, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business.  Our security procedures, such as virus protection software, cyber security and our business continuity planning, such as our disaster recovery policies and back-up systems, may not be adequate or implemented properly to fully address the adverse effect of such events, which could adversely impact our operations.  In addition, our business could be adversely affected to the extent we do not make the appropriate level of investment in our technology systems as our technology systems become out-of-date or obsolete.If we are unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms, it could have an adverse impact on our net income, cash flows and financial condition. – Affecting each RegistrantWe rely on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows.  Volatility and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect our ability to raise capital and fund our capital needs, including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness.  In addition, if capital is available only on less than reasonable terms or to borrowers whose creditworthiness is better than ours, capital costs could increase materially.  Restricted access to capital markets and/or increased borrowing costs could have an adverse impact on net income, cash flows and financial condition.Downgrades in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital and/or to operate our power trading businesses. – Affecting each RegistrantThe credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings.  Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to us and could limit our access to funding for our operations.  Our business is capital intensive, and we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive.  In periods of market turmoil, access to capital is difficult for all borrowers.  If our ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained, our interest costs will likely increase and our financial condition could be harmed and future results of operations could be adversely affected.  30  Our power trading business relies on the investment grade ratings of our individual public utility subsidiaries’ senior unsecured long-term debt or on the investment grade ratings of AEP parent.  Most of our counterparties require the creditworthiness of an investment grade entity to stand behind transactions.  If those ratings were to decline below investment grade, our ability to operate our power trading business profitably would be diminished because we would likely have to deposit cash or cash-related instruments which would reduce our profits.Our pension plan could require additional significant contributions. – Affecting each RegistrantThe performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our defined benefit pension plan.  The volatility of the capital markets in the past years has affected the market value of these assets.  Also, a decline in interest rates on corporate bonds in 2011 has impacted the benchmark discount rate in a way that results in a higher calculated pension liability.  Accordingly, our future required contributions to fund obligations under our defined benefit plan could be more than expected.AEP has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other obligations due it from its subsidiaries. – Affecting AEPAEP is a holding company and has no operations of its own.  Its ability to meet its financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries, primarily its regulated utilities, and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to, or repay loans from, AEP.  Its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation (apart from loans from AEP) to provide AEP with funds for its payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions or other payments.  Payments to AEP by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations.  In addition, any payment of dividends, distributions or advances by the utility subsidiaries to AEP could be subject to regulatory restrictions.  AEP indebtedness and common stock dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness and preferred stock obligations.Our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions. – Affecting each RegistrantElectric power generation is generally a seasonal business.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter.  As a result, our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the terms of power sale contracts that we enter into.  In addition, we have historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder.  Unusually mild weather in the future could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition.  Conversely, unusually extreme weather conditions could increase AEP’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable.Further, deteriorating economic conditions generally result in reduced consumption by our customers, particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely, while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues.  As a result, our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate on the basis of prevailing economic conditions.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm our results of operations. – Affecting each RegistrantCertain events, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs.  The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development.  In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise.  Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business.  If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our results of operations could be negatively affected.  31  Parties we have engaged to provide construction materials or services may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm our results of operations. – Affecting each RegistrantOur business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades, construction of additional generation units and transmission facilities as well as other initiatives.  We are exposed to the risk of substantial price increases in the costs of materials used in construction.  We have engaged numerous contractors and entered into a large number of agreements to acquire the necessary materials and/or obtain the required construction related services.  As a result, we are also exposed to the risk that these contractors and other counterparties could breach their obligations to us.  Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current market prices that may exceed our contractual prices and almost certainly cause delays in that and related projects.  Although our agreements are designed to mitigate the consequences of a potential default by the counterparty, our actual exposure may be greater than these mitigation provisions.  This would cause our financial results to be diminished, and we might incur losses or delays in completing construction.Changes in commodity prices and the costs of transport may increase our cost of producing power or decrease the amount we receive from selling power, harming our financial performance. – Affecting each RegistrantWe are exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal and the price and availability to transport coal because most of our generating capacity is coal-fired.  We have contracts of varying durations for the supply of coal for most of our existing generation capacity, but as these contracts end or otherwise are not honored, we may not be able to purchase coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts.  Similarly, we are exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances.  We use emission allowances based on the amount of coal we use as fuel and the reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures.  As long as current environmental programs remain in effect, we have sufficient emission allowances to cover nearly all of our projected needs for the next two years as well as a majority of our needs beyond that timeframe.  If the Federal EPA’s replacement rule to reduce interstate transport were to take effect, additional costs may be incurred to acquire supplemental allowances for compliance or to achieve further reductions in emissions.  If and when we obtain additional allowances those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those currently obtained.  Our risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge.We also own natural gas-fired facilities which increases our exposure to market prices of natural gas.  Natural gas prices tend to be more volatile than prices for other fuel sources.  Our ability to make off-system sales at a profit is highly dependent on the price of natural gas.  As the price of natural gas falls, other market participants that utilize natural gas-fired generation will be able to offer electricity at increasingly competitive prices relative to our off-system sales prices, so the margins we realize from sales will be lower and, on occasion, we may need to curtail operation of marginal plants.  The availability of shale natural gas and issues related to its accessibility may have a long-term material effect on the price of natural gas.Prices for coal, natural gas and emission allowances have shown material upward and downward swings in the recent past.  Changes in the cost of coal, emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power will affect our financial results.  Since the prices we obtain for power may not change at the same rate as the change in coal, emission allowances or natural gas costs, we may be unable to pass on the changes in costs to our customers.In addition, actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value our trading and marketing transactions, and those differences may be material.  As a result, our financial results may be diminished in the future as those transactions are marked to market.  32  RISKS RELATING TO STATE RESTRUCTURINGWe are unable to fully predict the effects of legal separation in Ohio and becoming subject to market forces. – Affecting AEP and OPCoIn January 2012, the PUCO approved the corporate separation plan of OPCo’s generation assets to complete the transition to a fully competitive generation market by June 2015.  The corporate separation plan also would require approval by the FERC under provisions of the Federal Power Act.  In February 2012, as part of the PUCO’s entry on rehearing which rejected the ESP approved modified stipulation, the PUCO revoked its approval of OPCo’s corporate separation plan.  Also, in February 2012, prior to the PUCO revoking OPCo’s corporate separation plan, an application was filed with the FERC seeking approval, among other things, to transfer OPCo’s generation assets to APCo, KPCo and a nonregulated AEP subsidiary.  If we can obtain regulatory approvals, our results of operations related to Ohio generation would be determined by our ability to sell power at a profit at rates determined by the prevailing market.  As a result of the February 2012 ESP rehearing order, we are in the process of withdrawing the PUCO and FERC applications.  We intend to file new FERC and PUCO applications related to corporate separation.  We can give no assurance that the PUCO or the FERC will not impose material adverse terms as a condition to approving our legal separation.  Additionally, certain of our generation units may no longer be cost effective and may be retired prior to the end of their anticipated useful life.  Because such generation assets are no longer subject to cost recovery regulation, this could result in material impairments. We are unable to predict the consequences of terminating the Interconnection Agreement and breaking up the AEP Power Pool. – Affecting AEP, APCo, I&M and OPCoThe proposed corporate separation plans of OPCo’s generation assets will require us to either terminate or substantially alter the Interconnection Agreement.  The Interconnection Agreement establishes the AEP Power Pool which permits AEP East companies to share costs and benefits associated with their generating plants on a cost basis.  It is unknown at this time whether the AEP Power Pool will be replaced by a new agreement among some or all of the members, whether individual companies will enter into bi-lateral or multi-party contracts with each other for power sales and purchases or asset transfers or if each company will choose to operate independently.  If the AEP Power Pool is terminated without any subsequent agreements between some or all of the parties, surplus members will no longer automatically sell to deficit members, and they may not be able to otherwise sell that surplus in amounts or at rates equal to what they obtained under the Interconnection Agreement.  Conversely, deficit members will no longer automatically purchase from surplus members, and they may not be able to otherwise purchase in amounts or at rates equal to what they obtained under the Interconnection Agreement.  The possible loss of these sales by the surplus members and the potential increase in costs for the deficit members could reduce future net income and cash flows.  We have filed with the FERC seeking approval of the termination of the Interconnection Agreement, the implementation of a power cost sharing agreement between APCo, I&M and KPCo, and to transfer certain generation assets from OPCo to APCo, KPCo and a nonregulated AEP subsidiary.  As a result of the February 2012 ESP rehearing order, we are in the process of withdrawing the PUCO and FERC applications.  We intend to file new FERC and PUCO applications related to corporate separation.  We can give no assurance that the FERC or other state utility commissions will not impose material adverse terms as a condition to approving these arrangements and the termination of the Interconnection Agreement.Customers are choosing alternative electric generation service providers, as allowed by Ohio law and regulation. – Affecting AEP and OPCoUnder current Ohio law, electric generation is sold in a competitive market in Ohio and native load customers in Ohio have the ability to switch to alternative suppliers for their electric generation service.  Competitive power suppliers are targeting retail customers by offering alternative generation service.  A growing number of commercial retail customers have switched to alternative generation providers while additional Ohio customers have provided notice of their intent to switch.  In 2011, we lost approximately 10% of our Ohio load due to customer switching.  Currently, there are no limitations on the obligation to provide below cost capacity rate pricing to alternative suppliers to support customers switching in Ohio.  These evolving market conditions will continue to impact our results of operations.  33  Collection of our revenues in Texas is concentrated in a limited number of REPs. – Affecting AEPOur revenues from the distribution of electricity in the ERCOT area of Texas are collected from REPs that supply the electricity we distribute to their customers.  Currently, we do business with approximately one hundred REPs.  In 2011, TCC’s largest customer accounted for 22% of its operating revenue and its second largest customer accounted for 12% of its operating revenue; TNC’s largest customer (a non-utility affiliate) accounted for 28% of its operating revenues and its second largest customer accounted for 15% of its operating revenues.  Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the Texas market or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for our services or could cause them to delay such payments.  We depend on these REPs for timely remittance of payments.  Any delay or default in payment could adversely affect the timing and receipt of our cash flows and thereby have an adverse effect on our liquidity.RISKS RELATED TO OWNING AND OPERATING GENERATION ASSETS AND SELLING POWEROur costs of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant. – Affecting each RegistrantOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety.  Approximately 90% of the electricity generated by the AEP System is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels.  Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury and particulates from fossil fueled generating plants are subject to increased regulations, controls and mitigation expenses.  Compliance with these legal requirements requires us to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees and permits at all of our facilities and could cause us to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.  These expenditures have been significant in the past and we expect that they will continue to be significant in order to comply with the current and proposed regulations.  Costs of compliance with environmental regulations could adversely affect our net income and financial position, especially if emission and/or discharge limits are tightened, more extensive permitting requirements are imposed, additional substances become regulated and the number and types of assets we operate increase.  If we retire generating plants prior to the end of their estimated useful life, there can be no assurance that we will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants.  While we expect to recover our expenditures for pollution control technologies, replacement generation and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates (in regulated jurisdictions) or market prices, without such recovery those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and possibly harm our financial condition.Regulation of CO2 emissions, either through legislation or by the Federal EPA, could materially increase costs to us and our customers or cause some of our electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain. – Affecting each RegistrantThe U.S. Congress has not taken any significant steps toward enacting legislation to control CO2 emissions since 2009.  In December 2009, the Federal EPA issued a final endangerment finding under the CAA regarding emissions from motor vehicles.  The Federal EPA also finalized CO2 emission standards for new motor vehicles, and issued a rule that implements a permitting program for new and modified stationary sources of CO2 emissions in a phased manner through 2014.  Several groups have filed challenges to the endangerment finding and the Federal EPA’s subsequent rulemakings.  The Federal EPA has announced its intent to propose a CO2 emissions standard for new power generation sources during the next year.  Management believes some policy approaches being discussed would have significant and widespread negative consequences for the national economy and major U.S. Industrial enterprises, including us and our customers.If CO2 and other emission standards are imposed, the standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs which would impact the ultimate retirement of older, less-efficient, coal-fired units.  While we expect that costs of complying with new CO2 and other GHG emission standards will be treated like all other reasonable costs of serving customers and should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business, without such recovery those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and harm our financial condition.  34  Courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims against us may order us to pay damages or to limit or reduce our CO2 emissions. – Affecting each RegistrantThere are a number of pending cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which we, among others, are defendants.  In general, the actions allege that CO2 emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance due to impacts of global warming and climate change.  The plaintiffs in these actions seek recovery of damages and other relief.  If these or other future actions are resolved against us, substantial modifications of our existing coal-fired power plants could be required and we might be required to limit or reduce CO2 emissions.  Such remedies could require us to purchase power from third parties to fulfill our commitments to supply power to our customers.  This could have a material impact on our costs.  In addition, we could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment, accelerate the timing of capital expenditures, pay damages or penalties and/or halt operations.  While management believes such costs should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business in our jurisdictions where generation rates are set on a cost of service basis, without such recovery those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and harm our financial condition.  Moreover, our results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation.We may not fully recover the costs of repairing or replacing damaged equipment in Cook Plant Unit 1 and may be required to pay additional accidental outage insurance proceeds to ratepayers. – Affecting AEP and I&MCook Plant Unit 1 is a 1,084 MW nuclear generating unit located in Bridgman, Michigan.  In September 2008, I&M shut down Cook Plant Unit 1 (Unit 1) due to turbine vibrations, caused by blade failure, which resulted in significant turbine damage and a small fire on the electric generator.  This equipment, located in the turbine building, is separate and isolated from the nuclear reactor.  The turbine rotors that caused the vibration were installed in 2006 and were within the vendor’s warranty period.  The warranty provides for the repair or replacement of the turbine rotors if the damage was caused by a defect in materials or workmanship.  Repair of the property damage and replacement of the turbine rotors and other equipment cost approximately $400 million.  Management believes that I&M should recover a significant portion of these costs through the turbine vendor’s warranty, insurance and the regulatory process.  I&M repaired Unit 1.  It resumed operations in 2009 at slightly reduced power and a full-capacity blade was installed in 2011.  If the ultimate costs of the incident are not covered by warranty, insurance or through the regulatory process or if any future regulatory proceedings are adverse, it could have an adverse impact on net income, cash flows and financial condition.   35   Our revenues and results of operations from selling power are subject to market risks that are beyond our control. – Affecting each RegistrantWe sell power from our generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis.  We also enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity, natural gas, emission allowances and coal as part of our power marketing and energy trading operations.  With respect to such transactions, the rate of return on our capital investments is not determined through mandated rates, and our revenues and results of operations are likely to depend, in large part, upon prevailing market prices for power in our regional markets and other competitive markets.  These market prices can fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time.  Trading margins may erode as markets mature and there may be diminished opportunities for gain should volatility decline.  In addition, the FERC, which has jurisdiction over wholesale power rates, as well as RTOs that oversee some of these markets, may impose price limitations, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets.  Power supply and other similar agreements entered into during extreme market conditions may subsequently be held to be unenforceable by a reviewing court or the FERC.  Fuel and emissions prices may also be volatile, and the price we can obtain for power sales may not change at the same rate as changes in fuel and/or emissions costs.  These factors could reduce our margins and therefore diminish our revenues and results of operations.  Volatility in market prices for fuel and power may result from: ·  Weather conditions.·  Outages of major generation or transmission facilities.·  Seasonality.·  Power usage.·  Illiquid markets.·  Transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies.·  Availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources.·  Demand for energy commodities.·  Natural gas, crude oil and refined products and coal production levels.·  Natural disasters, wars, embargoes and other catastrophic events.·  Federal, state and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation. Our power trading (including coal, gas and emission allowances trading and power marketing) and risk management policies cannot eliminate the risk associated with these activities. – Affecting each RegistrantOur power trading (including coal, gas and emission allowances trading and power marketing) activities expose us to risks of commodity price movements.  We attempt to manage our exposure by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management procedures.  These risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate the risks associated with these activities.  As a result, we cannot predict the impact that our energy trading and risk management decisions may have on our business, operating results or financial position.We routinely have open trading positions in the market, within guidelines we set, resulting from the management of our trading portfolio.  To the extent open trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results and financial position.Our power trading and risk management activities, including our power sales agreements with counterparties, rely on projections that depend heavily on judgments and assumptions by management of factors such as the future market prices and demand for power and other energy-related commodities.  These factors become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future these estimates are made.  Even when our policies and procedures are followed and decisions are made based on these estimates, results of operations may be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those calculations prove to be inaccurate.  36   Parties with whom we have contracts may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm our results of operations. – Affecting each RegistrantWe are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe us money or power could breach their obligations.  Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at then-current market prices that may exceed our contractual prices, which would cause our financial results to be diminished and we might incur losses.  Although our estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty, our actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict.We rely on electric transmission facilities that we do not own or control.  If these facilities do not provide us with adequate transmission capacity, we may not be able to deliver our wholesale electric power to the purchasers of our power. – Affecting each RegistrantWe depend on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power we sell at wholesale.  This dependence exposes us to a variety of risks.  If transmission is disrupted, or transmission capacity is inadequate, we may not be able to sell and deliver our wholesale power.  If a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, our recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited.  If restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure.The FERC has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales.  Although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions for electricity and gas, access to transmission systems may in fact not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable.  We also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets.We do not fully hedge against price changes in commodities. – Affecting each Registrant We routinely enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity, natural gas, coal and emission allowances as part of our power marketing and energy and emission allowances trading operations.  In connection with these trading activities, we routinely enter into financial contracts, including futures and options, over-the counter options, financially-settled swaps and other derivative contracts.  These activities expose us to risks from price movements.  If the values of the financial contracts change in a manner we do not anticipate, it could harm our financial position or reduce the financial contribution of our trading operations.We manage our exposure by establishing risk limits and entering into contracts to offset some of our positions (i.e., to hedge our exposure to demand, market effects of weather and other changes in commodity prices).  However, we do not always hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility.  To the extent we do not hedge against commodity price volatility, our results of operations and financial position may be improved or diminished based upon our success in the market.Financial derivatives reforms could increase the liquidity needs and costs of our commercial trading operations. – Affecting each RegistrantIn July 2010, federal legislation was enacted to reform financial markets that significantly alter how over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives are regulated.  The law increased regulatory oversight of OTC energy derivatives, including (1) requiring standardized OTC derivatives to be traded on registered exchanges regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), (2) imposing new and potentially higher capital and margin requirements and (3) authorizing the establishment of overall volume and position limits.  The law gives the CFTC authority to exempt end users of energy commodities which could reduce, but not eliminate, the applicability of these measures to us and other end users.  These requirements could cause our OTC transactions to be more costly and have an adverse effect on our liquidity due to additional capital requirements.  In addition, as these reforms aim to standardize OTC products it could limit the effectiveness of our hedging programs because we would have less ability to tailor OTC derivatives to match the precise risk we are seeking to manage.  37

6,AEP,AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER CO,2011-02-25,"ITEM 1A.                            RISK FACTORSGeneral Risks of Our Regulated OperationsWe may not be able to recover the costs of our substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions.   (Applies to each registrant.)Our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits, construction and/or acquisition of additional generation units and transmission facilities, modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives. Our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions.  If these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates we charge, we would not be able to recover the costs associated with our planned extensive investment.  This would cause our financial results to be diminished.  While we may seek to limit the impact of any denied recovery by attempting to reduce the scope of our capital investment, there can be no assurance as to the effectiveness of any such mitigation efforts, particularly with respect to previously incurred costs and commitments.We may not fully recover all of the investment in and expenses related to the Turk Plant.  (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo)SWEPCo is in the process of building the John W. Turk Plant (the “Turk Plant”) in southwest Arkansas and holds a 73% ownership interest in the planned 600MW coal-fired generating facility.  Its construction and anticipated operation has resulted in numerous legal challenges, including:·  the validity of the air permit issued by the Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission in connection with the operation of the Turk Plant;·  the validity of the wetlands permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in connection with the construction and operation of the Turk Plant;·  the validity of the authority granted by the APSC to build three transmission lines and facilities needed to transmit power from the Turk Plant;·  whether SWEPCo is required to obtain APSC approval to construct the Turk Plant without pursuing authority to seek recovery of the originally approved 88 MW portion of Turk Plant costs in Arkansas retail rates; and·  a complaint filed in the Federal District Court for the Western District of Arkansas against SWEPCo, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Department of Interior and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to stop construction of the Turk Plant asserting claims of violations of various federal and state laws.If SWEPCo is unable to complete the Turk Plant construction and place the Turk Plant in service or if SWEPCo cannot recover all of its investment in and expenses related to the Turk Plant, it would materially reduce future net income and cash flows and materially impact financial condition.   24  Our request for rate recovery in Ohio for distribution service may not be approved in its entirety.  (Applies to AEP, CSPCo and OPCo)In January 2011, CSPCo and OPCo filed a notice of intent with the PUCO to file for an annual increase in distribution rates of $34 million and $59 million, respectively, either as individual companies, or, if their proposed merger is approved, as a single merged entity.  The increase is based upon an 11.15% return on common equity to be effective January 2012. If the PUCO denies all or part of the requested rate recovery, it could reduce future net income and cash flows.Our request for rate recovery in Ohio for generation service may not be approved in its entirety.  (Applies to AEP, CSPCo and OPCo)In January 2011, CSPCo and OPCo filed an application with the PUCO to approve the new ESP that includes a standard service offer pricing for generation effective with the first billing cycle of January 2012 through the last billing cycle of May 2014.  The requested increase in 2012 is $54 million and in 2013 is $106 million.  If the PUCO denies all or part of the requested rate recovery, it could reduce future net income and cash flows.Ohio may require us to refund revenue that we have collected. (Applies to AEP, CSPCo and OPCo)Ohio law requires that the PUCO determine on an annual basis if rate adjustments included in prior orders resulted in significantly excessive earnings.  If the rate adjustments result in significantly excessive earnings, the excess amount could be returned to customers.  In September 2010, CSPCo and OPCo filed their 2009 significantly excessive earnings filings with the PUCO.  In January 2011, the PUCO ruled that CSPCo generated approximately $43 million in significantly excessive earnings during 2009. The ruling is subject to rehearing by the PUCO and could be appealed in the courts.  If rehearing or a final appeal, if any, results in findings of additional significantly excessive earnings, then further amounts will be returned to customers. CSPCo and OPCo must file their 2010 significantly excessive earnings filings with the PUCO. If the PUCO determines that CSPCo’s and/or OPCo’s 2010 earnings were significantly excessive, CSPCo and/or OPCo may be required to return a portion of their revenues to customers. Ohio may require us to refund fuel costs that we have collected. (Applies to OPCo)The PUCO selected an outside consultant to conduct an audit of recovery under the fuel adjustment clause for the period of January 2009 through December 2009.  The audit report included a recommendation that the PUCO should review whether any proceeds from a 2008 coal contract settlement agreement which totaled $72 million should reduce OPCo’s under-recovery balance.  Of the total proceeds, approximately $58 million was recognized as a reduction to fuel expense prior to 2009 and $14 million reduced fuel expense in 2009 and 2010.  If the PUCO orders any portion of the $58 million or other future adjustments be used to reduce the current year fuel adjustment clause deferral, it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.Ohio may require us to refund rider revenue that we have collected. (Applies to CSPCo and OPCo)The PUCO approved recovery of an Economic Development Rider (EDR) by CSPCo and OPCo.  An intervenor in that proceeding has filed a notice of appeal of that award with the Supreme Court of Ohio.  As of December 31, 2010, CSPCo and OPCo have incurred $38 million and $30 million, respectively, in EDR costs including carrying costs.  If CSPCo and OPCo are not ultimately permitted to recover their deferrals it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  25  Our request for rate recovery in West Virginia may not be approved in its entirety.  (Applies to AEP and APCo)In May 2010, APCo and WPCo filed a request with the WVPSC to increase annual base rates by $156 million based on an 11.75% return on common equity to be effective March 2011.  If the WVPSC denies all or part of the requested rate recovery, it could reduce future net income and cash flows.Oklahoma may require us to refund fuel costs that we have collected. (Applies to PSO)In July 2009, the OCC initiated a proceeding to review PSO’s fuel and purchased power adjustment clause for the calendar year 2008 and also initiated a prudence review of the related costs.  In March 2010, the Oklahoma Attorney General and an intervenor recommended the fuel clause adjustment rider be amended to decrease the shareholder’s portion of off-system sales margins from 25% to 10%.  That intervenor also recommended that the OCC conduct a comprehensive review of all affiliate transactions during 2007 and 2008.  In July 2010, additional testimony regarding the 2007 transfer of ERCOT trading contracts to AEP Energy Partners was filed.  Included in this testimony were unquantified refund recommendations relating to re-pricing of contract transactions.  If the OCC were to issue an unfavorable decision, it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.Our future access to assets used to serve a major customer is in question.  (Applies to I&M)Since 1975 I&M has leased certain energy delivery assets from the City of Fort Wayne, Indiana under a long-term lease that expired on February 28, 2010.  As a result of a court-sponsored mediation process, I&M agreed to purchase the leased assets from Fort Wayne.  The agreement was signed in October 2010 and is subject to approval by the IURC.  If the IURC does not approve the agreement or the recovery of the costs resulting from the agreement or the lease, it could reduce future net income and cash flows.We may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled.   (Applies to each registrant)Our business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks, including construction delays, nonperformance by equipment and other third party suppliers, and increases in equipment and labor costs. To limit the risks of these construction projects, we enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits. If any of these projects is canceled for any reason, including our failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits, we could incur significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts. In addition, if we have recorded any construction work or investments as a regulatory asset we may need to impair that asset in the event the project is canceled.Rate regulation may delay or deny full recovery of capital improvements, additions and other costs.   (Applies to each registrant.)Our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions.  These rates are generally regulated based on an analysis of the applicable utility’s expenses incurred in a test year.  Thus, commission-approved rates may or may not match a utility’s expenses at any given time.  There may also be a delay between the timing of when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered.  Traditionally, we have financed capital investments and improvements until the new asset was placed in service.  Provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment, the asset was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery.  Long lead times in construction, the high costs of plant and equipment and difficult capital markets have heightened the risks involved in our capital investments and improvements. While we are actively pursuing strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow, including pre-approvals, a return on construction work in progress, rider/trackers, formula rates and the inclusion of future test-year projections into rates, there can be no assurance that these will be adopted, that the applicable regulatory commission will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will be done in a timely manner.  26  Certain of our revenues and results of operations are subject to risks that are beyond our control.   (Applies to each registrant.)Our operations are structured to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations and we take measures to minimize the risk of significant disruptions.  Material disruptions at one or more of our operational facilities, however, could negatively impact our revenues, operating and capital expenditures and results of operations.  Such events may also create additional risks related to the supply and/or cost of equipment and materials.  We could experience unexpected but significant interruption due to several events, including:·  major facility or equipment failure;·  an environmental event such as a serious spill or release;·  fires, floods, droughts, earthquakes, hurricanes or other natural disasters;·  wars, terrorist acts or threats and other catastrophic events;·  significant health impairments or disease events, and;·  other serious operational problems.We are exposed to nuclear generation risk. (Applies to AEP and I&M.)Through I&M, we own the Cook Plant.  It consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2,191 MW, or 8-9% of the electricity we generate.  We are, therefore, subject to the risks of nuclear generation, which include the following:·  the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials such as spent nuclear fuel;·  limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with our nuclear operations;·  uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts if insurance coverage is inadequate (federal law requires owners of nuclear units to purchase the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance and potentially contribute to the losses of others); and,·  uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives.There can be no assurance that I&M’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if and when these risks are triggered.The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities.  In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants such as ours.  In addition, although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our plants, if an incident did occur, it could harm our results of operations or financial condition.  A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.  Moreover, a major incident at any nuclear facility in the U.S. could require us to make material contributory payments.  27  Costs associated with the operation (including fuel), maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation, in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards, availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities.  Costs also may include replacement power, any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the Cook Plant (whether scheduled or premature), the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs.  Our ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the Cook Plant is not assured.The different regional power markets in which we compete or will compete in the future have changing market and transmission structures, which could affect our performance in these regions.  (Applies to each registrant.)Our results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets.  The rules governing the various regional power markets, including SPP and PJM, may also change from time to time which could affect our costs or revenues.  Because the manner in which RTOs will evolve remains unclear, we are unable to assess fully the impact that changes in these power markets may have on our business.The amount we charged third parties for using our transmission facilities is subject to refund.  (Applies to AEP, APCo, CSPCo, I&M and OPCo.)In July 2003, the FERC issued an order directing PJM and MISO to make compliance filings for their respective tariffs to eliminate the transaction-based charges for through and out (T&O) transmission service on transactions where the energy is delivered within those RTOs.  To mitigate the impact of lost T&O revenues, the FERC approved temporary replacement seams elimination cost allocation (SECA) transition rates beginning in December 2004 and extending through March 2006.  Because intervenors objected to this decision, the SECA fees we collected ($220 million) are subject to refund.  Some claims for refund have been settled, and we have recorded a provision for estimated settlement refunds for the remaining unsettled $108 million of gross SECA revenues collected.  Any payments in excess of the reserve balance could harm our results of operations and financial position.We could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards. (Applies to each registrant.)As a result of EPACT, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by the FERC. These standards, which previously were being applied on a voluntary basis, became mandatory in June 2007. The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and is guided by reliability and market interface principles. Compliance with new reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures. While we expect to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates, there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner.  If we were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates.At times, demand for power could exceed our supply capacity.   (Applies to each registrant.)We are currently obligated to supply power in parts of eleven states.  From time to time, because of unforeseen circumstances, the demand for power required to meet these obligations could exceed our available generation capacity.  If this occurs, we would have to buy power from the market.  This would increase the pressure on our short-term debt financing capacity in times of tight liquidity.  We may not always have the ability to pass these costs on to our customers, and the time lag between incurring costs and recovery can be long.  Since these situations most often occur during periods of peak demand, it is possible that the market price for power at that time would be very high. Even if a supply shortage were brief, we could suffer substantial losses that could reduce our results of operations.   28  Risks Related to Market, Economic or Financial VolatilityIf we are unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms, it could have an adverse impact on our net income, cash flows and financial condition.  (Applies to each registrant)We rely on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows.  Volatility and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect our ability to raise capital and fund our capital needs, including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness.  In addition, if capital is available only on less than reasonable terms or to borrowers whose creditworthiness is better than ours, capital costs could increase materially.  Restricted access to capital markets and/or increased borrowing costs could have an adverse impact on net income, cash flows and financial condition.Downgrades in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital and/or to operate our power trading businesses.  (Applies to each registrant)The credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings.  Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to us and could limit our access to funding for our operations.  Our business is capital intensive, and we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive.  In periods of market turmoil, access to capital is difficult for all borrowers.  If our ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained, our interest costs will likely increase and our financial condition could be harmed and future results of operations could be adversely affected.Our power trading business relies on the investment grade ratings of our individual public utility subsidiaries’ senior unsecured long-term debt.  Most of our counterparties require the creditworthiness of an investment grade entity to stand behind transactions.  If those ratings were to decline below investment grade, our ability to operate our power trading business profitably would be diminished because we would likely have to deposit cash or cash-related instruments which would reduce our profits.Our pension plan will require additional significant contributions. (Applies to each registrant.)The performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our defined benefit pension plan.  The volatility of the capital markets in the past years has led to a decline in the market value of these assets. Also, a decline in interest rates on corporate bonds in 2010 has impacted the benchmark discount rate in a way that results in a higher calculated pension liability. Accordingly, our future required contributions to fund obligations under our defined benefit plan could increase significantly.AEP has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other obligations due it from its subsidiaries.  (Applies to AEP.)AEP is a holding company and has no operations of its own.  Its ability to meet its financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries, primarily its regulated utilities, and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to, or repay loans from, AEP.  Its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation (apart from loans from AEP) to provide AEP with funds for its payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions or other payments. Payments to AEP by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations. In addition, any payment of dividends, distributions or advances by the utility subsidiaries to AEP could be subject to regulatory restrictions.  AEP indebtedness and common stock dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness and preferred stock obligations.   29  Our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic conditions.  (Applies to each registrant.)Electric power generation is generally a seasonal business.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter.  As a result, our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the terms of power sale contracts that we enter into.  In addition, we have historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder.  Unusually mild weather in the future could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition.  Conversely, unusually extreme weather conditions could increase AEP’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable.Further, deteriorating economic conditions generally result in reduced consumption by our customers, particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely, while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues.  As a result, our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate on the basis of prevailing economic conditions.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm our results of operations. (Applies to each registrant.)Certain events, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business.  If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our results of operations could be negatively affected.Parties we have engaged to provide construction materials or services may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm our results of operations.  (Applies to each registrant.)Our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades, construction of additional generation units and transmission facilities as well as other initiatives.  We are exposed to the risk of substantial price increases in the costs of materials used in construction.  We have engaged numerous contractors and entered into a large number of agreements to acquire the necessary materials and/or obtain the required construction related services.  As a result, we are also exposed to the risk that these contractors and other counterparties could breach their obligations to us. Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current market prices that may exceed our contractual prices and almost certainly cause delays in that and related projects.  Although our agreements are designed to mitigate the consequences of a potential default by the counterparty, our actual exposure may be greater than these mitigation provisions. This would cause our financial results to be diminished, and we might incur losses or delays in completing construction.Changes in commodity prices and the costs of transport may increase our cost of producing power or decrease the amount we receive from selling power, harming our financial performance.  (Applies to each registrant.)We are exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal and the price and availability to transport coal because most of our generating capacity is coal-fired.  We have contracts of varying durations for the supply of coal for most of our existing generation capacity, but as these contracts end or otherwise are not honored, we may not be able to purchase coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts.  Similarly, we are exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances.  We use emission allowances based on the amount of coal we use as fuel and the reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures.  According to our estimates, we have procured sufficient emission allowances to cover nearly all of our projected needs for the next two years as well as a majority of our needs beyond that timeframe.  At some future point, additional costs may be incurred if forthcoming regulation changes require supplemental allowances for compliance.  If and when we obtain additional allowances those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those currently obtained.   30  We also own natural gas-fired facilities, which increases our exposure to market prices of natural gas.  Natural gas prices tend to be more volatile than prices for other fuel sources.  Our ability to make off-system sales at a profit is highly dependent on the price of natural gas.  As the price of natural gas falls, other market participants that utilize natural gas-fired generation will be able to offer electricity at increasingly competitive prices relative to our off-system sales prices, so the margins we realize from sales will be lower and, on occasion, we may need to curtail operation of marginal plants.Prices for coal, natural gas and emission allowances have shown material upward and downward swings in the recent past.  Changes in the cost of coal, emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power will affect our financial results.  Since the prices we obtain for power may not change at the same rate as the change in coal, emission allowances or natural gas costs, we may be unable to pass on the changes in costs to our customers.In addition, actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value our trading and marketing transactions, and those differences may be material.  As a result, our financial results may be diminished in the future as those transactions are marked to market.Risks Relating to State RestructuringOur customers have recently begun to select alternative electric generation service providers, as allowed by Ohio legislation. (Applies to AEP and CSPCo) Under current Ohio legislation, electric generation is sold in a competitive market in Ohio, and our native load customers in Ohio have the ability to switch to alternative suppliers for their electric generation service.  Competitive power suppliers are targeting retail customers by offering alternative generation service.   A growing number of CSPCo's commercial retail customers have switched to alternative generation providers while additional Ohio customers have provided notice of their intent to switch.  In 2010, CSPCo lost about 3% of its total load due to customer switching.  To date, OPCo’s losses have not been significant.  These evolving market conditions will continue to impact CSPCo's results of operations.There is uncertainty as to our recovery of stranded costs resulting from industry restructuring in Texas.  (Applies to AEP.)Restructuring legislation in Texas required utilities with stranded costs to use market-based methods to value certain generating assets for determining stranded costs.  We elected to use the sale of assets method to determine the market value of TCC’s generation assets for stranded cost purposes.  In general terms, the amount of stranded costs under this market valuation methodology is the amount by which the book value of generating assets, including regulatory assets and liabilities that were not securitized, exceeds the market value of the generation assets, as measured by the net proceeds from the sale of the assets.  In May 2005, TCC filed its stranded cost quantification application with the PUCT seeking recovery of $2.4 billion of net stranded generation costs and other recoverable true-up items.  A final order was issued in April 2006.  In the final order, the PUCT determined TCC’s net stranded generation costs and other recoverable true-up items to be approximately $1.475 billion.  We have appealed the PUCT’s final order seeking additional recovery consistent with the Texas Restructuring Legislation and related rules, other parties have appealed the PUCT’s final order as unwarranted or too large.  Management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any future court appeals or any future remanded PUCT proceeding.Collection of our revenues in Texas is concentrated in a limited number of REPs.  (Applies to AEP.)Our revenues from the distribution of electricity in the ERCOT area of Texas are collected from REPs that supply the electricity we distribute to their customers.  Currently, we do business with approximately one hundred REPs.  In 2010, TCC’s largest customer accounted for 25% of its operating revenue and its second largest customer accounted for 13% of its operating revenue; TNC’s largest customer (a non-utility affiliate) accounted for 29% of its operating revenues and its second largest customer accounted for 16% of its operating revenues.  Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the Texas market or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for our services or could cause them to delay such payments.  We depend on these REPs for timely remittance of payments.  Any delay or default in payment could adversely affect the timing and receipt of our cash flows and thereby have an adverse effect on our liquidity.  31  Risks Related to Owning and Operating Generation Assets and Selling PowerOur costs of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant.  (Applies to each registrant)Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety.  Approximately 90% of the electricity generated by the AEP system is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels.  Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury and particulates from fossil fueled generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulations, controls and mitigation expenses.  Compliance with these legal requirements requires us to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees and permits at all of our facilities.  These expenditures have been significant in the past, and we expect that they will increase in the future.  Costs of compliance with environmental regulations could adversely affect our net income and financial position, especially if emission and/or discharge limits are tightened, more extensive permitting requirements are imposed, additional substances become regulated and the number and types of assets we operate increase.  While we expect to recover our expenditures for pollution control technologies, replacement generation and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates (in regulated jurisdictions) or market prices, without such recovery those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows, and possibly harm our financial condition.Regulation of CO2 emissions, either through legislation or by the Federal EPA, could materially increase costs to us and our customers or cause some of our electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain.  (Applies to each registrant)In June 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the American Clean Energy Security Act (ACES).  ACES is a comprehensive energy and global warming bill that includes a number of provisions that would directly affect our business, including energy efficiency and renewable electricity standards, funding for carbon capture and sequestration demonstration projects, CO2 emission standards, and an economy-wide cap and trade program for large sources of CO2 emissions that would reduce emissions by 17% in 2020 and just over 80% by 2050 from 2005 levels.  Costs of compliance with the proposed legislation could adversely affect our net income and financial position.  This legislation did not become law.Separately, in December 2009, the Federal EPA issued a final endangerment finding under the CAA regarding emissions from motor vehicles.  Several groups have filed challenges to the endangerment finding.  The endangerment finding will lead to regulation of CO2 and other gases under existing laws.  Management believes some policy approaches being discussed would have significant and widespread negative consequences for the national economy and major U.S. industrial enterprises, including us and our customers.If CO2 and other emission standards are imposed, the standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs which would impact the ultimate retirement of older, less-efficient, coal-fired units.  While we expect that costs of complying with new CO2 and other GHG emission standards will be treated like all other reasonable costs of serving customers and should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business, without such recovery those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and harm our financial condition.Courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims against us may order us to limit or reduce our CO2 emissions.  (Applies to each registrant)In 2004, eight states and the City of New York filed an action in Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York against AEP, Cinergy Corp, Xcel Energy, Southern Company and Tennessee Valley Authority.  The Natural Resources Defense Council, on behalf of three special interest groups, filed a similar complaint against the same defendants.  The actions allege that CO2 emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance under federal common law due to impacts of global warming, and sought injunctive relief in the form of specific emission reduction commitments from the defendants.  The Second Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated this lawsuit on appeal after the lower court had dismissed it. ; The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear the defendants’ request for appeal.  32  The trial court adjudicating the reinstated nuisance claims may order the defendants, including us, to limit or reduce CO2 emissions.  This or similar remedies could require us to purchase power from third parties to fulfill our commitments to supply power to our customers.  This could have a material impact on our costs.  While management believes such costs should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business, without such recovery those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and harm our financial condition.If these or other future actions are resolved against us, substantial modifications of our existing coal-fired power plants could be required.  In addition, we could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment, accelerate the timing of capital expenditures, pay penalties and/or halt operations.  Moreover, our results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation.We may not fully recover the costs of repairing or replacing damaged equipment in Cook Plant Unit 1 and may be required to pay additional accidental outage insurance proceeds to ratepayers.  (Applies to AEP and I&M)Cook Plant Unit 1 is a 1,084 MW nuclear generating unit located in Bridgman, Michigan.  In September 2008, I&M shut down Cook Plant Unit 1 (Unit 1) due to turbine vibrations, caused by blade failure, which resulted in significant turbine damage and a small fire on the electric generator.  This equipment, located in the turbine building, is separate and isolated from the nuclear reactor.  The turbine rotors that caused the vibration were installed in 2006 and were within the vendor’s warranty period.  The warranty provides for the repair or replacement of the turbine rotors if the damage was caused by a defect in materials or workmanship.  Repair of the property damage and replacement of the turbine rotors and other equipment could cost up to approximately $395 million.  Management believes that I&M should recover a significant portion of these costs through the turbine vendor’s warranty, insurance and the regulatory process.  I&M repaired Unit 1 and it resumed operations in December 2009 at slightly reduced power.  If the ultimate costs of the incident are not covered by warranty, insurance or through the regulatory process or if any future regulatory proceedings are adverse, it could have an adverse impact on net income, cash flows and financial condition.Our revenues and results of operations from selling power are subject to market risks that are beyond our control.  (Applies to each registrant.)We sell power from our generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis.  We also enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity, natural gas, emission allowances and coal as part of our power marketing and energy trading operations.  With respect to such transactions, the rate of return on our capital investments is not determined through mandated rates, and our revenues and results of operations are likely to depend, in large part, upon prevailing market prices for power in our regional markets and other competitive markets.  These market prices can fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time.  Trading margins may erode as markets mature and there may be diminished opportunities for gain should volatility decline.60; In addition, the FERC, which has jurisdiction over wholesale power rates, as well as RTOs that oversee some of these markets, may impose price limitations, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets.  Power supply and other similar agreements entered into during extreme market conditions may subsequently be held to be unenforceable by a reviewing court or the FERC.  Fuel and emissions prices may also be volatile, and the price we can obtain for power sales may not change at the same rate as changes in fuel and/or emissions costs.  These factors could reduce our margins and therefore diminish our revenues and results of operations.   33  Volatility in market prices for fuel and power may result from:·  weather conditions;·  outages of major generation or transmission facilities;·  seasonality;·  power usage;·  illiquid markets;·  transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies;·  availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources;·  demand for energy commodities;·  natural gas, crude oil and refined products, and coal production levels;·  natural disasters, wars, embargoes and other catastrophic events; and·  federal, state and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation.Our power trading (including coal, gas and emission allowances trading and power marketing) and risk management policies cannot eliminate the risk associated with these activities.  (Applies to each registrant.)Our power trading (including coal, gas and emission allowances trading and power marketing) activities expose us to risks of commodity price movements. We attempt to manage our exposure by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management procedures. These risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate the risks associated with these activities. As a result, we cannot predict the impact that our energy trading and risk management decisions may have on our business, operating results or financial position.We routinely have open trading positions in the market, within guidelines we set, resulting from the management of our trading portfolio. To the extent open trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results and financial position.Our power trading and risk management activities, including our power sales agreements with counterparties, rely on projections that depend heavily on judgments and assumptions by management of factors such as the future market prices and demand for power and other energy-related commodities. These factors become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future these estimates are made. Even when our policies and procedures are followed and decisions are made based on these estimates, results of operations may be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those calculations prove to be inaccurate.Our financial performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to operate our electric generating facilities successfully.  (Applies to each registrant.)Our performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of our electric generating facilities. Operating electric generating facilities involves many risks, including:·  operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes;·  operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements;·  labor disputes;·  fuel supply interruptions caused by transportation constraints, adverse weather, non-performance by our suppliers and other factors; and·  catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, hurricanes, terrorism, floods or other similar occurrences.A decrease or elimination of revenues from power produced by our electric generating facilities or an increase in the cost of operating the facilities would adversely affect our results of operations.   34  Parties with whom we have contracts may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm our results of operations.  (Applies to each registrant.)We are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe us money or power could breach their obligations. Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at then-current market prices that may exceed our contractual prices, which would cause our financial results to be diminished and we might incur losses. Although our estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty, our actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict.We rely on electric transmission facilities that we do not own or control. If these facilities do not provide us with adequate transmission capacity, we may not be able to deliver our wholesale electric power to the purchasers of our power.  (Applies to each registrant.)We depend on transmission facilities owned and operated by other unaffiliated power companies to deliver the power we sell at wholesale. This dependence exposes us to a variety of risks. If transmission is disrupted, or transmission capacity is inadequate, we may not be able to sell and deliver our wholesale power. If a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, our recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited. If restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure.The FERC has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales. Although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions for electricity and gas, access to transmission systems may in fact not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable. We also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets.We do not fully hedge against price changes in commodities.  (Applies to each registrant.)We routinely enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity, natural gas, coal and emission allowances as part of our power marketing and energy and emission allowances trading operations. In connection with these trading activities, we routinely enter into financial contracts, including futures and options, over-the counter options, financially-settled swaps and other derivative contracts. These activities expose us to risks from price movements. If the values of the financial contracts change in a manner we do not anticipate, it could harm our financial position or reduce the financial contribution of our trading operations.We manage our exposure by establishing risk limits and entering into contracts to offset some of our positions (i.e., to hedge our exposure to demand, market effects of weather and other changes in commodity prices). However, we do not always hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility. To the extent we do not hedge against commodity price volatility, our results of operations and financial position may be improved or diminished based upon our success in the market.Financial derivatives reforms could increase the liquidity needs and costs of our commercial trading operations.  (Applies to each registrant.)In July 2010, federal legislation was enacted to reform financial markets that significantly alter how over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives are regulated.  The law increased regulatory oversight of OTC energy derivatives, including (1) requiring standardized OTC derivatives to be traded on registered exchanges regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), (2) imposing new and potentially higher capital and margin requirements and (3) authorizing the establishment of overall volume and position limits.  The law gives the CFTC authority to exempt end users of energy commodities which could reduce, but not eliminate, the applicability of these measures to us and other end users.  These requirements could cause our OTC transactions to be more costly and have an adverse effect on our liquidity due to additional capital requirements.  In addition, as these reforms aim to standardize OTC products it could limit the effectiveness of our hedging programs because we would have less ability to tailor OTC derivatives to match the precise risk we are seeking to manage.  35 "
