5,CMS,CMS ENERGY CORP,2024-02-08,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to a variety of factors, often beyond their control, that are difficult to predict and that involve uncertainties that may materially adversely affect CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ business, liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that management believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect CMS Energy or Consumers. The risk factors described in the following sections, as well as the other information included in this report and in other documents filed with the SEC, should be considered carefully before making an investment in securities of CMS Energy or Consumers. Risk factors of Consumers are also risk factors of CMS Energy.Investment/Financial RisksCMS Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service obligations.Due to its holding company structure, CMS Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other payment obligations. If sufficient dividends were not paid to CMS Energy by its subsidiaries, CMS Energy might not be able to generate the funds necessary to fulfill its payment obligations.Consumers’ ability to pay dividends or acquire its own stock from CMS Energy is limited by restrictions contained in Consumers’ preferred stock provisions and potentially by other legal restrictions, such as certain terms in its articles of incorporation and FERC requirements.CMS Energy has indebtedness that could limit its financial flexibility and its ability to meet its debt service obligations.The level of CMS Energy’s present and future indebtedness could have several important effects on its future operations, including, among others, that:•a significant portion of CMS Energy’s cash flow from operations could be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness and would not be available for other purposes•covenants contained in CMS Energy’s existing debt arrangements, which require it to meet certain financial tests, could affect its flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in its business•CMS Energy’s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate and other purposes could become limited•CMS Energy could be placed at a competitive disadvantage to its competitors that are less leveraged•CMS Energy’s vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions could increase•CMS Energy’s future credit ratings could fluctuateCMS Energy’s ability to meet its debt service obligations and to reduce its total indebtedness will depend on its future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, changes in laws or regulatory decisions, and financial, business, and other factors affecting its operations, many of which are beyond its control. CMS Energy cannot make assurances that its businesses will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness, which could require CMS Energy to sell assets or obtain additional financing.40Table of ContentsCMS Energy and Consumers have financing needs and could be unable to obtain bank financing or access the capital markets.CMS Energy and Consumers rely on the capital markets, as well as on bank syndications, to meet their financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs not otherwise funded internally.Disruptions in the capital and credit markets, or the inability to obtain required regulatory authorization for issuances of securities including debt, could adversely affect CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ access to liquidity needed for their businesses. Any liquidity disruption could require CMS Energy and Consumers to take measures to conserve cash including, but not limited to, deferring capital expenditures, changing commodity purchasing strategies to avoid collateral-posting requirements, and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases, dividend payments, or other discretionary uses of cash.Entering into new financings is subject in part to capital market receptivity to utility industry securities in general and to CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ securities in particular. CMS Energy and Consumers continue to explore financing opportunities to supplement their respective financial strategies. These potential opportunities include refinancing and/or issuing new debt, issuing CMS Energy preferred stock and/or common equity, or entering into commercial paper, bank financing, and leasing arrangements. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot guarantee the capital markets’ acceptance of their securities. CMS Energy and Consumers may also, from time to time, repurchase (either in open market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions), redeem, or otherwise retire outstanding debt. Such activities, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may or may not be material.Certain of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ securities and those of their affiliates are rated by various credit rating agencies. A reduction or withdrawal of one or more of its credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ ability to access capital on acceptable terms and maintain commodity lines of credit, could increase their cost of borrowing, and could cause CMS Energy or Consumers to reduce capital expenditures. If either or both were unable to maintain commodity lines of credit, CMS Energy or Consumers might have to post collateral or make prepayments to certain suppliers under existing contracts. Further, since Consumers provides dividends to CMS Energy, any adverse developments affecting Consumers that result in a lowering of its credit ratings could have an adverse effect on CMS Energy’s credit ratings.Market performance and other changes could decrease the value of employee benefit plan assets, which then could require substantial funding.The performance of various markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ pension and postretirement benefit plans. CMS Energy and Consumers have significant obligations under these plans and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which could fall below CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ forecasted return rates. A decline in the market value of the assets or a change in the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels could significantly increase the funding requirements of these obligations. Also, changes in demographics, including an increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, could significantly increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and postretirement benefit plans.41Table of ContentsIndustry/Regulatory RisksChanges to ROA could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses.Michigan law allows electric customers in Consumers’ service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount capped at ten percent of Consumers’ sales, with certain exceptions. The proportion of Consumers’ electric deliveries under the ROA program and on the ROA waiting list is over ten percent. Consumers’ rates are regulated by the MPSC, while alternative electric suppliers charge market-based rates, putting competitive pressure on Consumers’ electric supply. Groups are advocating for an ROA-like community solar system that allows third parties to sell directly to customers and offer them a regulated bill credit. If the ROA limit were increased, this new ROA-like community solar system were allowed, or electric generation service in Michigan were deregulated, it could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers.Distributed energy resources could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses.Michigan law allows customers to use distributed energy resources for their electric energy needs. These distributed energy resources are connected to Consumers’ electric grid. The 2023 Energy Law increases the cap on distributed generation to ten percent of utilities’ peak loads. It also specifies an inflow and outflow rate method that must be implemented by the MPSC and provides federal funding for low-income distributed generation. Recent FERC policy allows many customer-owned behind-the-meter and grid-connected distributed energy resources to participate in and receive revenue from wholesale electricity markets. Increased customer use of distributed energy resources could result in a reduction of Consumers’ electric sales. Third parties’ operations of distributed energy resources could also potentially have a negative impact on the stability of the grid. An increase in customers’ use of distributed energy resources, and the rate structure for distributed energy resources customers’ use of Consumers’ system and Consumers’ purchases of their excess generation, could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers.CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation, which could have a material adverse effect on financial results.CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation. Consumers’ electric and gas retail rates are set by the MPSC and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization. If rate regulators fail to provide adequate rate relief, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers or Consumers’ plans for making significant capital investments. Additionally, increasing rates could result in additional regulatory scrutiny, regulatory or legislative actions, and increased competitive or political pressures, all of which could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.Orders of the MPSC could limit recovery of costs of providing service. These orders could also result in adverse regulatory treatment of other matters. For example, MPSC orders could prevent or curtail Consumers from shutting off non‑paying customers or could prevent or limit the implementation of an electric or gas revenue mechanism. Regulators could face competitive or political pressures to avoid or limit rate increases for a number of reasons, including economic downturn in the state, reliability and economic justice concerns, or decreased customer base, among others.FERC authorizes certain subsidiaries of CMS Energy, including Consumers, to sell wholesale electricity at market-based rates and to provide certain other wholesale electric services at rates and terms subject to FERC approval. Failure of these subsidiaries to maintain this FERC authority could have a material 42Table of Contentsadverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Electric transmission and natural gas pipeline rates paid by Consumers and other CMS Energy subsidiaries are also set by FERC, as are the tariff terms governing the participation of Consumers and other CMS Energy subsidiaries in FERC-regulated wholesale electricity markets operated by regional transmission organizations and independent system operators such as MISO and PJM. At least one CMS Energy subsidiary participates in the wholesale electricity markets operated by ERCOT, over which FERC has limited control.The various risks associated with the MPSC and FERC regulation of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses, which include the risk of adverse decisions in any number of rate or regulatory proceedings before either agency, as well as judicial proceedings challenging any agency decisions, could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers. Changes to the tariffs or business practice manuals of certain wholesale market operators such as MISO, PJM, or ERCOT could also have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers.Utility regulation, state or federal legislation, and compliance could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses.CMS Energy and certain of its subsidiaries, including Consumers, are subject to, or affected by, extensive utility regulation and state and federal legislation. If it were determined that CMS Energy or Consumers failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations or with applicable tariff provisions, they could become subject to fines, penalties, or disallowed costs, or be required to implement additional compliance, cleanup, or remediation programs, the cost of which could be material. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the impact of new laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices by federal or state agencies or wholesale electricity market operators, or challenges or changes to present laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices and the interpretation of any adoption or change. Furthermore, any state or federal legislation concerning CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ operations could also have a material adverse effect.FERC, through NERC and its delegated regional entities, oversees reliability of certain portions of the electric grid. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the impact of FERC orders or actions of NERC and its regional entities on electric system reliability. Additionally, national gas pipeline infrastructure has recently been under scrutiny following disruptions related to extreme weather and cyber incidents. In 2021, the Transportation Security Administration issued two mandatory security directives related to natural gas pipelines that apply to Consumers. Additional regulation in this area could adversely affect Consumers’ gas operations.CMS Energy and Consumers have announced ambitious plans to reduce their impact on climate change and increase the reliability of their electric distribution system. Achieving these plans depends on numerous factors, many of which are outside of their control.Consumers has announced a long-term strategy for delivering clean, reliable, resilient, and affordable energy, including a plan to end coal use in 2025. The MPSC, FERC, other regulatory authorities, or other third parties may prohibit, delay, or impair some or all of Consumers’ planned acquisitions of owned or purchased electric generation capacity. Consumers may be unable to acquire, site, and/or permit some or all of the generation capacity proposed in its plan. Consumers’ ability to implement its plan may be affected by environmental regulations, global supply chain disruptions, and changes in the cost, availability, and supply of generation capacity. While CMS Energy and Consumers continue to advocate for advances in technologies required to reduce or eliminate greenhouse gases on a cost-effective basis, such advances are largely outside of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ control. Advancements in technology related to items such as battery storage and electric vehicles may not become commercially 43Table of Contentsavailable or economically feasible as projected. Customer programs such as energy efficiency and demand response may not realize the projected levels of customer participation. Consumers has also announced its Natural Gas Delivery Plan, a rolling ten‑year investment plan to deliver safe, reliable, clean, and affordable natural gas to customers. This plan includes accelerated infrastructure replacements, innovative leak detection technology, and process changes to reduce or eliminate methane emissions. The MPSC, FERC, other regulatory authorities, or other third parties may prohibit, delay, or impair the Natural Gas Delivery Plan and some or all of the associated capital investments. Consumers’ ability to implement its plan may be affected by environmental regulations, global supply chain disruptions, and changes in the cost, availability, and supply of natural gas or the ability to deliver natural gas to customers. Advancements in technology related to items such as renewable natural gas may not become commercially available or economically feasible as projected in Consumers’ plan. CMS Energy and Consumers could suffer financial loss, reputational damage, litigation, or other negative repercussions if they are unable to achieve their ambitious plans.Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact CMS Energy and Consumers. CMS Energy and Consumers are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. The tax obligations include income taxes, real estate taxes, sales and use taxes, employment-related taxes, and ongoing issues related to these tax matters. The judgments include determining reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken and may be subject to challenge by the IRS and/or other taxing authorities. Unfavorable settlements of any of the issues related to these reserves or other tax matters at CMS Energy or Consumers could have a material adverse effect. Additionally, changes in federal, state, or local tax rates or other changes in tax laws could have adverse impacts.CMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers, must comply with the Dodd-Frank Act and its related regulations.The Dodd-Frank Act provides for regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of certain commodity-related contracts. Although CMS Energy, Consumers, and certain subsidiaries of NorthStar Clean Energy qualify for an end-user exception from mandatory clearing of commodity-related swaps, these regulations could affect the ability of these entities to participate in these markets and could add additional regulatory oversight over their contracting activities.CMS Energy and Consumers could incur substantial costs to comply with environmental requirements.CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to costly and stringent environmental regulations that may require additional significant capital expenditures for CCR disposal and storage, emission reductions, and PCB remediation. In addition, regulatory action on PFAS at the state and/or federal level could cause CMS Energy and Consumers to further test and remediate some sites if PFAS is present at certain levels. Present and reasonably anticipated state and federal environmental statutes and regulations will continue to have a material effect on CMS Energy and Consumers.CMS Energy and Consumers have interests in fossil-fuel-fired power plants, other types of power plants, and natural gas systems that emit greenhouse gases. Federal, state, and local environmental laws and rules, as well as international accords and treaties, could require CMS Energy and Consumers to install 44Table of Contentsadditional equipment for emission controls, undertake heat-rate improvement projects, purchase carbon emissions allowances, curtail operations, invest in generating capacity with fewer carbon dioxide emissions, or take other significant steps to manage or lower the emission of greenhouse gases. Similarly, Consumers could be restricted from constructing natural gas infrastructure due to potential environmental regulations, which could require more costly alternatives.The following risks related to climate change, emissions, and environmental regulations could also have a material adverse impact on CMS Energy and Consumers:•a change in regulators’ implementation of policy or litigation originated by third parties against CMS Energy or Consumers due to CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ greenhouse gas or other emissions or CCR disposal and storage•impairment of CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ reputation due to their greenhouse gas or other emissions and public perception of their response to potential environmental regulations, rules, and legislation•weather that may affect customer demand, company operations, or company infrastructure, including catastrophic weather-related damage and extreme temperatures; natural disasters such as severe storms, floods, and droughts; fires; or smoke•implementation of state or federal environmental justice requirementsConsumers expects to collect fully from its customers, through the ratemaking process, expenditures incurred to comply with environmental regulations, but cannot guarantee this outcome. If Consumers were unable to recover these expenditures from customers in rates, CMS Energy or Consumers could be required to seek significant additional financing to fund these expenditures.For additional information regarding compliance with environmental regulations, see Item 1. Business—CMS Energy and Consumers Environmental Strategy and Compliance and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Outlook.CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses could be affected adversely by any delay in meeting environmental requirements.A delay or failure by CMS Energy or Consumers to obtain or maintain any necessary environmental permits or approvals to satisfy any applicable environmental regulatory requirements or install emission or pollution control equipment could:•prevent the construction of new facilities•prevent the continued operation of and sale of energy from existing facilities•modify the way in which a facility is operated•prevent the suspension of operations at existing facilities•prevent the modification of existing facilities•result in significant additional costs, including fines or penaltiesCMS Energy and Consumers expect to incur additional substantial costs related to environmental remediation of former sites.Consumers expects to incur additional substantial costs related to the remediation of its former MGP sites and other response activity costs at a number of other former sites, including, but not limited to, sites of retired coal-fueled electric generating units, under NREPA, RCRA, and CERCLA. Consumers believes these costs should be recoverable in rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome.45Table of ContentsBusiness/Operations RisksThere are risks associated with Consumers’ substantial capital investment program planned for the next five years.Consumers’ planned investments include the construction or acquisition of electric generation, electric and gas infrastructure, conversions and expansions, environmental controls, electric grid modernization technology, and other electric and gas investments to upgrade delivery systems, as well as decommissioning of older facilities. The success of these capital investments depends on or could be affected by a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to:•effective pre-acquisition evaluation of asset values, future operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities, and other factors beyond Consumers’ control•effective cost and schedule management of new capital projects•availability of qualified construction personnel, both internal and contracted•changes in commodity and other prices, applicable tariffs, and/or material and equipment availability•governmental actions•operational performance•changes in environmental, legislative, and regulatory requirements•regulatory cost recovery•inflation of labor rates and material and equipment prices•supply chain disruptions and increased lead times•barriers to accessing key materials for renewable projects (solar, battery, and other key equipment) created by geopolitical relationsIt is possible that adverse events associated with these factors could have a material adverse effect on Consumers.CMS Energy and Consumers could be affected adversely by legacy litigation and retained liabilities.The agreements that CMS Energy and Consumers enter into for the sale of assets customarily include provisions whereby they are required to:•retain specified preexisting liabilities, such as for taxes, pensions, or environmental conditions•indemnify the buyers against specified risks, including the inaccuracy of representations and warranties that CMS Energy and Consumers make•make payments to the buyers depending on the outcome of post-closing adjustments, litigation, audits, or other reviews, including claims resulting from attempts by foreign or domestic governments to assess taxes on past operations or transactionsMany of these contingent liabilities can remain open for extended periods of time after the sales are closed. Depending on the extent to which the buyers might ultimately seek to enforce their rights under these contractual provisions, and the resolution of any disputes concerning them, there could be a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.Consumers is exposed to risks related to general economic conditions in its service territories.Consumers’ electric and gas utility businesses are affected by the economic conditions impacting the customers they serve. If the Michigan economy becomes sluggish or declines, Consumers could experience reduced demand for electricity or natural gas that could result in decreased earnings and cash 46Table of Contentsflow. In addition, economic conditions in Consumers’ service territory affect its collections of accounts receivable and levels of lost or stolen gas.Consumers is exposed to changes in customer usage that could impact financial results.Technology advances, government incentives and subsidies, and regulatory decisions could increase the cost effectiveness of customer-owned methods of producing electricity and managing energy use resulting in reduced load, cross subsidization, and increased costs.Customers could also reduce their consumption through energy waste reduction programs. Similarly, customers could also reduce their consumption of natural gas through alternative technologies or fuels or through electrification.CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ energy sales and operations are affected by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions from year to year.CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment, while peak demand for natural gas occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as heating fuel. Accordingly, CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ overall results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Mild temperatures during the summer cooling season and winter heating season as well as the impact of extreme weather events on Consumers’ system could have a material adverse effect.CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to information security risks, risks of unauthorized access to their systems, and technology failures.In the regular course of business, CMS Energy and Consumers handle a range of sensitive confidential security and customer information. In addition, CMS Energy and Consumers operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information and control technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite implementation of security measures, technology systems, including disaster recovery and backup systems, are vulnerable to failure, cyber crime, unauthorized access, and being disabled. These events could impact the reliability of electric generation and electric and gas delivery and also subject CMS Energy and Consumers to financial harm. Cyber crime, which includes the use of malware, ransomware, computer viruses, and other means for disruption or unauthorized access against companies, including CMS Energy and Consumers, is increasing in frequency, scope, and potential impact. While CMS Energy and Consumers have not been subject to cyber incidents that have had a material impact on their operations to date, their security measures in place may be insufficient to prevent a major cyber incident in the future. If technology systems, including disaster recovery and backup systems, were to fail or be breached, CMS Energy and Consumers might not be able to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive confidential and proprietary data could be compromised. In addition, because CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ generation, transmission, and distribution systems are part of an interconnected system, a disruption caused by a cyber incident at another utility, electric generator, system operator, or commodity supplier could also adversely affect CMS Energy or Consumers.A variety of technological tools and systems, including both company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties, support critical functions. The failure of these technologies, including backup systems, or the inability of CMS Energy and Consumers to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded, or integrated into other technologies, could hinder their business operations. 47Table of ContentsCMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses have liability risks.Consumers’ electric and gas delivery systems, power plants, gas infrastructure including storage facilities, wind energy or solar equipment, energy products, vehicle fleets and equipment, or other assets; the independent power plants or other assets and equipment owned in whole or in part by CMS Energy; or CMS Energy or Consumers employees could be involved in incidents, failures, or accidents that result in injury, loss of life, or property loss to customers, employees, or the public. Although CMS Energy and Consumers have insurance coverage for many potential incidents (subject to deductibles, limitations, and self-insurance amounts that could be material), depending upon the nature or severity of any incident, failure, or accident, CMS Energy or Consumers could suffer financial loss, reputational damage, and negative repercussions from regulatory agencies or other public authorities.CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to risks that are beyond their control, including but not limited to natural disasters, civil unrest, terrorist attacks and related acts of war, cyber incidents, vandalism, and other catastrophic events.Natural disasters, severe weather, extreme temperatures, fires, smoke, flooding, wars, terrorist acts, civil unrest, vandalism, theft, cyber incidents, pandemics, and other catastrophic events could result in severe damage to CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ assets beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies (which are subject to deductibles, limitations, and self-insurance amounts that could be material), could require CMS Energy and Consumers to incur significant upfront costs, and could severely disrupt operations, resulting in loss of service to customers. There is also a risk that regulators could, after the fact, conclude that Consumers’ preparedness or response to such an event was inadequate and take adverse actions as a result.Energy risk management strategies might not be effective in managing fuel and electricity pricing risks, which could result in unanticipated liabilities to CMS Energy and Consumers or increased volatility in their earnings.CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to changes in market prices for commodities including, but not limited to, natural gas, coal, electric capacity, electric energy, emission allowances, gasoline, diesel fuel, and RECs. CMS Energy and Consumers manage commodity price risk using established policies and procedures, and they may use various contracts to manage this risk, including swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts. No assurance can be made that these strategies will be successful in managing CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ risk or that they will not result in net liabilities to CMS Energy or Consumers as a result of future volatility.A substantial portion of Consumers’ operating expenses for its electric generating plants and vehicle fleet consists of the costs of obtaining these commodities. The contracts associated with Consumers’ fuel for electric generation and purchased power are executed in conjunction with the PSCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover prudently incurred costs associated with its positions in these commodities. If the MPSC determined that any of these contracts or related contracting policies were imprudent, recovery of these costs could be disallowed.Natural gas prices in particular have been historically volatile. Consumers routinely enters into contracts for natural gas to mitigate exposure to the risks of demand, market effects of weather, and changes in commodity prices associated with the gas distribution business. These contracts are executed in conjunction with the GCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover prudently incurred costs associated with its natural gas positions. If the MPSC determined that any of these contracts or related contracting policies were imprudent, recovery of these costs could be disallowed.48Table of ContentsCMS Energy and Consumers do not always hedge any or all of the exposure of their operations from commodity price volatility. Furthermore, the ability to hedge exposure to commodity price volatility depends on liquid commodity markets. As a result, to the extent the commodity markets are illiquid, CMS Energy and Consumers might not be able to execute their risk management strategies, which could result in larger unhedged positions than preferred at a given time. To the extent that unhedged positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices could have a negative effect on CMS Energy and Consumers. Changes in laws that limit CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ ability to hedge could also have a negative effect on CMS Energy and Consumers.Consumers might not be able to obtain an adequate supply of natural gas or coal, which could limit its ability to operate its electric generation facilities or serve its natural gas customers.Consumers has natural gas and coal supply and transportation contracts in place for the natural gas and coal it requires for its electric generating capacity. Consumers also has interstate transportation and supply agreements in place to facilitate delivery of natural gas to its customers. Apart from the contractual and monetary remedies available to Consumers in the event of a counterparty’s failure to perform under any of these contracts, there can be no assurances that the counterparties to these contracts will fulfill their obligations to provide natural gas or coal to Consumers. The counterparties under the agreements could experience financial or operational problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to Consumers. In addition, counterparties under these contracts might not be required to supply natural gas or coal to Consumers under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster or severe weather.If Consumers were unable to obtain its supply requirements, it could be required to purchase natural gas or coal at higher prices, implement its natural gas curtailment program filed with the MPSC, or purchase replacement power at higher prices.Unplanned outages or maintenance could be costly for CMS Energy or Consumers.Unforeseen outages or maintenance of the electric and gas delivery systems, power plants, gas infrastructure including storage facilities and compression stations, wind energy or solar equipment, and energy products owned in whole or in part by CMS Energy or Consumers may be required for many reasons. When unplanned outages occur, CMS Energy and Consumers will not only incur unexpected maintenance expenses, but may also have to make spot market purchases of electric and gas commodities that may exceed CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ expected cost of generation or gas supply, be forced to curtail services, or retire a given asset if the cost or timing of the maintenance is not reasonable and prudent. Unplanned generator outages could reduce the capacity credit CMS Energy or Consumers receives from MISO and could cause CMS Energy or Consumers to incur additional capacity costs in future years.General Risk Factors
CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to counterparty risk.Adverse economic conditions or financial difficulties experienced by counterparties with whom CMS Energy and Consumers do business could impair the ability of these counterparties to pay for CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ services and/or fulfill their contractual obligations, including performance and payment of damages. CMS Energy and Consumers depend on these counterparties to remit payments and perform contracted services in a timely and adequate fashion. Any delay or default in payment or performance, including inadequate performance, of contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers.49Table of ContentsVolatility and disruptions in capital and credit markets could have a negative impact on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ lenders, vendors, contractors, suppliers, customers, and other counterparties, causing them to fail to meet their obligations. CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to significant reputational risks.CMS Energy and Consumers could suffer negative impacts to their reputations as a result of operational incidents, violations of corporate policies, regulatory violations, inappropriate use of social media, or other events. Reputational damage could have a material adverse effect and could result in negative customer perception and increased regulatory oversight.A work interruption or other union actions could adversely affect Consumers.At December 31, 2023, unions represent 45 percent of Consumers’ employees. Consumers’ union agreements expire in 2025. If these employees were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, Consumers could experience a significant disruption in its operations and higher ongoing labor costs.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ results of operations.In some areas, competition for skilled employees is high and if CMS Energy and Consumers were unable to match skill sets to future needs, they could encounter operating challenges and increased costs. These challenges could include a lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and delays in skill development. Additionally, higher costs could result from the use of contractors to replace employees, loss of productivity, and safety incidents. Failing to train replacement employees adequately and to transfer internal knowledge and expertise could adversely affect CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ ability to manage and operate their businesses"
0,CMS,CMS ENERGY CORP,2023-02-09,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to a variety of factors, often beyond their control, that are difficult to predict and that involve uncertainties that may materially adversely affect CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ business, liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that management believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect CMS Energy or Consumers. The risk factors described in the following sections, as well as the other information included in this report and in other documents filed with the SEC, should be considered carefully before making an investment in securities of CMS Energy or Consumers. Risk factors of Consumers are also risk factors of CMS Energy.Investment/Financial RisksCMS Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service obligations.Due to its holding company structure, CMS Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other payment obligations. If sufficient dividends were not paid to CMS Energy by its subsidiaries, CMS Energy might not be able to generate the funds necessary to fulfill its payment obligations.Consumers’ ability to pay dividends or acquire its own stock from CMS Energy is limited by restrictions contained in Consumers’ preferred stock provisions and potentially by other legal restrictions, such as certain terms in its articles of incorporation and FERC requirements.CMS Energy has indebtedness that could limit its financial flexibility and its ability to meet its debt service obligations.The level of CMS Energy’s present and future indebtedness could have several important effects on its future operations, including, among others, that:•a significant portion of CMS Energy’s cash flow from operations could be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness and would not be available for other purposes•covenants contained in CMS Energy’s existing debt arrangements, which require it to meet certain financial tests, could affect its flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in its business•CMS Energy’s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate and other purposes could become limited•CMS Energy could be placed at a competitive disadvantage to its competitors that are less leveraged•CMS Energy’s vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions could increase•CMS Energy’s future credit ratings could fluctuateCMS Energy’s ability to meet its debt service obligations and to reduce its total indebtedness will depend on its future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, changes in laws or regulatory decisions, and financial, business, and other factors affecting its operations, many of which are beyond its control. CMS Energy cannot make assurances that its businesses will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness, which could require CMS Energy to sell assets or obtain additional financing.37Table of ContentsCMS Energy and Consumers have financing needs and could be unable to obtain bank financing or access the capital markets.CMS Energy and Consumers rely on the capital markets, as well as on bank syndications, to meet their financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs not otherwise funded internally.Disruptions in the capital and credit markets, or the inability to obtain required FERC authorization for issuances of securities including debt, could adversely affect CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ access to liquidity needed for their businesses. Any liquidity disruption could require CMS Energy and Consumers to take measures to conserve cash including, but not limited to, deferring capital expenditures, changing commodity purchasing strategies to avoid collateral-posting requirements, and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases, dividend payments, or other discretionary uses of cash.Entering into new financings is subject in part to capital market receptivity to utility industry securities in general and to CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ securities in particular. CMS Energy and Consumers continue to explore financing opportunities to supplement their respective financial strategies. These potential opportunities include refinancing and/or issuing new debt, issuing CMS Energy preferred stock and/or common equity, or entering into commercial paper, bank financing, and leasing arrangements. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot guarantee the capital markets’ acceptance of their securities. CMS Energy may also, from time to time, repurchase (either in open market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions), redeem, or otherwise retire its outstanding debt. Such activities, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may or may not be material.Certain of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ securities and those of their affiliates are rated by various credit rating agencies. A reduction or withdrawal of one or more of its credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ ability to access capital on acceptable terms and maintain commodity lines of credit, could increase their cost of borrowing, and could cause CMS Energy or Consumers to reduce capital expenditures. If either or both were unable to maintain commodity lines of credit, CMS Energy or Consumers might have to post collateral or make prepayments to certain suppliers under existing contracts. Further, since Consumers provides dividends to CMS Energy, any adverse developments affecting Consumers that result in a lowering of its credit ratings could have an adverse effect on CMS Energy’s credit ratings.Market performance and other changes could decrease the value of employee benefit plan assets, which then could require substantial funding.The performance of various markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ pension and postretirement benefit plans. CMS Energy and Consumers have significant obligations under these plans and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which could fall below CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ forecasted return rates. A decline in the market value of the assets or a change in the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels could significantly increase the funding requirements of these obligations. Also, changes in demographics, including an increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, could significantly increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and postretirement benefit plans.38Table of ContentsIndustry/Regulatory RisksChanges to ROA could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses.Michigan law allows electric customers in Consumers’ service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount capped at ten percent of Consumers’ sales, with certain exceptions. The proportion of Consumers’ electric deliveries under the ROA program and on the ROA waiting list is over ten percent. Consumers’ rates are regulated by the MPSC, while alternative electric suppliers charge market-based rates, putting competitive pressure on Consumers’ electric supply. If the ROA limit were increased or if electric generation service in Michigan were deregulated, it could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers.Distributed energy resources could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses.Michigan law allows customers to use distributed energy resources for their electric energy needs. These distributed energy resources are connected to Consumers’ electric grid. The state distributed generation program is currently capped by the 2016 Energy Law at one percent of utilities’ peak loads, but in the settlement of its 2022 electric rate case, Consumers agreed to increase the cap to four percent on its system. Consumers is required to purchase distributed generation customers’ excess generation at rates determined by the MPSC. Recent FERC policy will also soon allow many customer-owned behind-the-meter and grid-connected distributed energy resources to participate in and receive revenue from wholesale electricity markets. Increased customer use of distributed energy resources could result in a reduction of Consumers’ electric sales. Third parties’ operations of distributed energy resources could also potentially have a negative impact on the stability of the grid. An increase in customers’ use of distributed energy resources, and the rate structure for distributed energy resources customers’ use of Consumers’ system and Consumers’ purchases of their excess generation, could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers.CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation, which could have a material adverse effect on financial results.CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation. Consumers’ electric and gas retail rates are set by the MPSC and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization. If rate regulators fail to provide adequate rate relief, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers or Consumers’ plans for making significant capital investments. Additionally, increasing rates could result in additional regulatory scrutiny, regulatory or legislative actions, and increased competitive or political pressures, all of which could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.Orders of the MPSC could limit recovery of costs of providing service. These orders could also result in adverse regulatory treatment of other matters. For example, MPSC orders could prevent or curtail Consumers from shutting off non‑paying customers or could prevent or limit the implementation of a gas revenue mechanism. Regulators could face competitive or political pressures to avoid or limit rate increases for a number of reasons, including economic downturn in the state or decreased customer base, among others.FERC authorizes certain subsidiaries of CMS Energy to sell wholesale electricity at market-based rates. Failure of these subsidiaries to maintain this FERC authority could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Transmission rates paid by Consumers and other CMS Energy subsidiaries are also set by FERC, as are the tariff terms 39Table of Contentsgoverning the participation of Consumers and other CMS Energy subsidiaries in FERC-regulated wholesale electricity markets operated by regional transmission organizations and independent system operators such as MISO and PJM. At least one CMS Energy subsidiary participates in the wholesale electricity markets operated by ERCOT, over which FERC has limited control.The various risks associated with the MPSC and FERC regulation of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses, which include the risk of adverse decisions in any number of rate or regulatory proceedings before either agency, as well as judicial proceedings challenging any agency decisions, could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers. Changes to the tariffs or business practice manuals of certain wholesale market operators such as MISO, PJM, or ERCOT could also have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers.Utility regulation, state or federal legislation, and compliance could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses.CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to, or affected by, extensive utility regulation and state and federal legislation. If it were determined that CMS Energy or Consumers failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations, they could become subject to fines, penalties, or disallowed costs, or be required to implement additional compliance, cleanup, or remediation programs, the cost of which could be material. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the impact of new laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices by federal or state agencies or wholesale electricity market operators, or challenges or changes to present laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices and the interpretation of any adoption or change. Furthermore, any state or federal legislation concerning CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ operations could also have a material adverse effect.FERC, through NERC and its delegated regional entities, oversees reliability of certain portions of the electric grid. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the impact of FERC orders or actions of NERC and its regional entities on electric system reliability. Additionally, national gas pipeline infrastructure has recently been under scrutiny following disruptions related to extreme weather and cyber incidents. In 2021, the Transportation Security Administration issued two mandatory security directives related to natural gas pipelines that apply to Consumers. Additional regulation in this area could adversely affect Consumers’ gas operations.CMS Energy and Consumers have announced ambitious plans to reduce their impact on climate change and increase the reliability of their electric distribution system. Achieving these plans depends on numerous factors, many of which are outside of their control.Consumers has announced a long-term strategy for delivering clean, reliable, resilient, and affordable energy, including a plan to end coal use in 2025 as set forth in the 2021 IRP. The MPSC, FERC, other regulatory authorities, or other third parties may prohibit, delay, or impair the 2021 IRP and some or all of the 2021 IRP-associated acquisitions of owned or purchased electric generation capacity. Consumers may be unable to acquire, site, and/or permit some or all of the generation capacity proposed in the 2021 IRP. Consumers’ ability to implement the 2021 IRP may be affected by global supply chain disruptions and changes in the cost, availability, and supply of generation capacity. While CMS Energy and Consumers continue to advocate for advances in technologies required to reduce or eliminate greenhouse gases on a cost-effective basis, such advances are largely outside of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ control. Advancements in technology related to items such as battery storage and electric vehicles may not become commercially available or economically feasible as projected in the 2021 IRP. Customer programs such as energy efficiency and demand response may not realize the projected levels of customer participation. 40Table of ContentsConsumers has also announced its Natural Gas Delivery Plan, a 10-year strategic investment plan to deliver safe, reliable, clean, and affordable natural gas to customers. This plan includes accelerated infrastructure replacements, innovative leak detection technology, and process changes to reduce or eliminate methane emissions. The MPSC, FERC, other regulatory authorities, or other third parties may prohibit, delay, or impair the Natural Gas Delivery Plan and some or all of the associated capital investments. Consumers’ ability to implement its plan may be affected by environmental regulations, global supply chain disruptions, and changes in the cost, availability, and supply of natural gas or the ability to deliver natural gas to customers. Advancements in technology related to items such as renewable natural gas may not become commercially available or economically feasible as projected in Consumers’ plan. CMS Energy and Consumers could suffer financial loss, reputational damage, litigation, or other negative repercussions if they are unable to achieve their ambitious plans.Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact CMS Energy and Consumers. CMS Energy and Consumers are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. The tax obligations include income taxes, real estate taxes, sales and use taxes, employment-related taxes, and ongoing issues related to these tax matters. The judgments include determining reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken and may be subject to challenge by the IRS and/or other taxing authorities. Unfavorable settlements of any of the issues related to these reserves or other tax matters at CMS Energy or Consumers could have a material adverse effect. Additionally, changes in federal, state, or local tax rates or other changes in tax laws could have adverse impacts.CMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers, must comply with the Dodd-Frank Act and its related regulations.The Dodd-Frank Act provides for regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of certain commodity-related contracts. Although CMS Energy, Consumers, and certain subsidiaries of NorthStar Clean Energy qualify for an end-user exception from mandatory clearing of commodity-related swaps, these regulations could affect the ability of these entities to participate in these markets and could add additional regulatory oversight over their contracting activities.CMS Energy and Consumers could incur substantial costs to comply with environmental requirements.CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to costly and stringent environmental regulations that will likely require additional significant capital expenditures for CCR disposal and storage, cooling water intake equipment, effluent treatment, and PCB remediation. In addition, regulatory action on PFAS at the state and/or federal level could cause CMS Energy and Consumers to further test and remediate some sites if PFAS is present at certain levels. Present and reasonably anticipated state and federal environmental statutes and regulations will continue to have a material effect on CMS Energy and Consumers.CMS Energy and Consumers have interests in fossil-fuel-fired power plants, other types of power plants, and natural gas systems that emit greenhouse gases. Federal, state, and local environmental laws and rules, as well as international accords and treaties, could require CMS Energy and Consumers to install additional equipment for emission controls, undertake heat-rate improvement projects, purchase carbon emissions allowances, curtail operations, invest in generating capacity with fewer carbon dioxide emissions, or take other significant steps to manage or lower the emission of greenhouse gases. Similarly, 41Table of ContentsConsumers could be restricted from constructing natural gas infrastructure due to potential environmental regulations, which could require more costly alternatives.The following risks related to climate change, emissions, and environmental regulations could also have a material adverse impact on CMS Energy and Consumers:•a change in regulators’ implementation of policy or litigation originated by third parties against CMS Energy or Consumers due to CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ greenhouse gas or other emissions or CCR disposal and storage•impairment of CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ reputation due to their greenhouse gas or other emissions and public perception of their response to potential environmental regulations, rules, and legislation•extreme weather conditions, such as severe storms or flooding, that may affect customer demand, company operations, or company infrastructureConsumers expects to collect fully from its customers, through the ratemaking process, expenditures incurred to comply with environmental regulations, but cannot guarantee this outcome. If Consumers were unable to recover these expenditures from customers in rates, CMS Energy or Consumers could be required to seek significant additional financing to fund these expenditures.For additional information regarding compliance with environmental regulations, see Item 1. Business—CMS Energy and Consumers Environmental Strategy and Compliance and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Outlook.CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses could be affected adversely by any delay in meeting environmental requirements.A delay or failure by CMS Energy or Consumers to obtain or maintain any necessary environmental permits or approvals to satisfy any applicable environmental regulatory requirements or install emission or pollution control equipment could:•prevent the construction of new facilities•prevent the continued operation of and sale of energy from existing facilities•prevent the suspension of operations at existing facilities•prevent the modification of existing facilities•result in significant additional costsCMS Energy and Consumers expect to incur additional substantial costs related to remediation of legacy environmental sites.Consumers expects to incur additional substantial costs related to the remediation of its former MGP sites and other response activity costs at a number of other sites, including, but not limited to, sites of retired coal-fueled electric generating units, under NREPA and CERCLA. Consumers believes these costs should be recoverable in rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome.Business/Operations RisksThere are risks associated with Consumers’ substantial capital investment program planned for the next ten years.Consumers’ planned investments include the construction or acquisition of electric generation, electric and gas infrastructure, conversions and expansions, environmental controls, electric grid modernization 42Table of Contentstechnology, and other electric and gas investments to upgrade delivery systems, as well as decommissioning of older facilities. The success of these capital investments depends on or could be affected by a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to:•effective pre-acquisition evaluation of asset values, future operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities, and other factors beyond Consumers’ control•effective cost and schedule management of new capital projects•availability of qualified construction personnel, both internal and contracted•changes in commodity and other prices, applicable tariffs, and/or material and equipment availability•governmental approvals and permitting•operational performance•changes in environmental, legislative, and regulatory requirements•regulatory cost recovery•inflation of labor rates•increases in lead times and disruptions in supply chain distribution•barriers to accessing key materials for renewable projects (solar, battery, and other key equipment) created by geopolitical relations and U.S. relations with ChinaIt is possible that adverse events associated with these factors could have a material adverse effect on Consumers.CMS Energy and Consumers could be affected adversely by legacy litigation and retained liabilities.The agreements that CMS Energy and Consumers enter into for the sale of assets customarily include provisions whereby they are required to:•retain specified preexisting liabilities, such as for taxes, pensions, or environmental conditions•indemnify the buyers against specified risks, including the inaccuracy of representations and warranties that CMS Energy and Consumers make•make payments to the buyers depending on the outcome of post-closing adjustments, litigation, audits, or other reviews, including claims resulting from attempts by foreign or domestic governments to assess taxes on past operations or transactionsMany of these contingent liabilities can remain open for extended periods of time after the sales are closed. Depending on the extent to which the buyers might ultimately seek to enforce their rights under these contractual provisions, and the resolution of any disputes concerning them, there could be a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.Consumers is exposed to risks related to general economic conditions in its service territories.Consumers’ electric and gas utility businesses are affected by the economic conditions impacting the customers they serve. If the Michigan economy becomes sluggish or declines, Consumers could experience reduced demand for electricity or natural gas that could result in decreased earnings and cash flow. In addition, economic conditions in Consumers’ service territory affect its collections of accounts receivable and levels of lost or stolen gas.43Table of ContentsConsumers is exposed to changes in customer usage that could impact financial results.Technology advances, government incentives and subsidies, and recent regulatory decisions could increase the cost effectiveness of customer-owned methods of producing electricity and managing energy use resulting in reduced load, cross subsidization, and increased costs.Customers could also reduce their consumption through demand-side energy conservation and energy waste reduction programs. Similarly, customers could also reduce their consumption of natural gas through alternative technologies or fuels.CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ energy sales and operations are affected by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions from year to year.CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment, while peak demand for natural gas typically occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as heating fuel. Accordingly, CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ overall results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Mild temperatures during the summer cooling season and winter heating season as well as the impact of extreme weather events on Consumers’ system could have a material adverse effect.CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to information security risks, risks of unauthorized access to their systems, and technology failures.In the regular course of business, CMS Energy and Consumers handle a range of sensitive confidential security and customer information. In addition, CMS Energy and Consumers operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information and control technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite implementation of security measures, technology systems, including disaster recovery and backup systems, are vulnerable to failure, cyber crime, unauthorized access, and being disabled. These events could impact the reliability of electric generation and electric and gas delivery and also subject CMS Energy and Consumers to financial harm. Cyber crime, which includes the use of malware, computer viruses, and other means for disruption or unauthorized access against companies, including CMS Energy and Consumers, is increasing in frequency, scope, and potential impact. While CMS Energy and Consumers have not been subject to cyber incidents that have had a material impact on their operations to date, their security measures in place may be insufficient to prevent a major cyber incident in the future. If technology systems, including disaster recovery and backup systems, were to fail or be breached, CMS Energy and Consumers might not be able to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive confidential and proprietary data could be compromised. In addition, because CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ generation, transmission, and distribution systems are part of an interconnected system, a disruption caused by a cyber incident at another utility, electric generator, system operator, or commodity supplier could also adversely affect CMS Energy or Consumers.A variety of technological tools and systems, including both company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties, support critical functions. The failure of these technologies, including backup systems, or the inability of CMS Energy and Consumers to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded, or integrated into other technologies, could hinder their business operations. 44Table of ContentsCMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses have liability risks.Consumers’ electric and gas delivery systems, power plants, gas infrastructure including storage facilities, wind energy or solar equipment, and energy products, and the independent power plants owned in whole or in part by CMS Energy could be involved in incidents, failures, or accidents that result in injury, loss of life, or property loss to customers, employees, or the public. Although CMS Energy and Consumers have insurance coverage for many potential incidents (subject to deductibles, limitations, and self-insurance amounts that could be material), depending upon the nature or severity of any incident, failure, or accident, CMS Energy or Consumers could suffer financial loss, reputational damage, and negative repercussions from regulatory agencies or other public authorities.CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to risks that are beyond their control, including but not limited to natural disasters, civil unrest, terrorist attacks and related acts of war, cyber incidents, vandalism, and other catastrophic events.Natural disasters, severe weather, wars, terrorist acts, civil unrest, vandalism, theft, cyber incidents, pandemics, and other catastrophic events could result in severe damage to CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ assets beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies (which are subject to deductibles, limitations, and self-insurance amounts that could be material), could require CMS Energy and Consumers to incur significant upfront costs, and could severely disrupt operations, resulting in loss of service to customers. There is also a risk that regulators could, after the fact, conclude that Consumers’ preparedness or response to such an event was inadequate and take adverse actions as a result.Energy risk management strategies might not be effective in managing fuel and electricity pricing risks, which could result in unanticipated liabilities to CMS Energy and Consumers or increased volatility in their earnings.CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to changes in market prices for commodities including, but not limited to, natural gas, coal, electric capacity, electric energy, emission allowances, gasoline, diesel fuel, and RECs. CMS Energy and Consumers manage commodity price risk using established policies and procedures, and they may use various contracts to manage this risk, including swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts. No assurance can be made that these strategies will be successful in managing CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ risk or that they will not result in net liabilities to CMS Energy or Consumers as a result of future volatility.A substantial portion of Consumers’ operating expenses for its electric generating plants and vehicle fleet consists of the costs of obtaining these commodities. The contracts associated with Consumers’ fuel for electric generation and purchased power are executed in conjunction with the PSCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover prudently incurred costs associated with its positions in these commodities. If the MPSC determined that any of these contracts or related contracting policies were imprudent, recovery of these costs could be disallowed.Natural gas prices in particular have been historically volatile. Consumers routinely enters into contracts for natural gas to mitigate exposure to the risks of demand, market effects of weather, and changes in commodity prices associated with the gas distribution business. These contracts are executed in conjunction with the GCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover prudently incurred costs associated with its natural gas positions. If the MPSC determined that any of these contracts or related contracting policies were imprudent, recovery of these costs could be disallowed.CMS Energy and Consumers do not always hedge any or all of the exposure of their operations from commodity price volatility. Furthermore, the ability to hedge exposure to commodity price volatility depends on liquid commodity markets. As a result, to the extent the commodity markets are illiquid, 45Table of ContentsCMS Energy and Consumers might not be able to execute their risk management strategies, which could result in larger unhedged positions than preferred at a given time. To the extent that unhedged positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices could have a negative effect on CMS Energy and Consumers. Changes in laws that limit CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ ability to hedge could also have a negative effect on CMS Energy and Consumers.Consumers might not be able to obtain an adequate supply of natural gas or coal, which could limit its ability to operate its electric generation facilities or serve its natural gas customers.Consumers has natural gas and coal supply and transportation contracts in place for the natural gas and coal it requires for its electric generating capacity. Consumers also has interstate transportation and supply agreements in place to facilitate delivery of natural gas to its customers. Apart from the contractual and monetary remedies available to Consumers in the event of a counterparty’s failure to perform under any of these contracts, there can be no assurances that the counterparties to these contracts will fulfill their obligations to provide natural gas or coal to Consumers. The counterparties under the agreements could experience financial or operational problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to Consumers. In addition, counterparties under these contracts might not be required to supply natural gas or coal to Consumers under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster or severe weather.If Consumers were unable to obtain its supply requirements, it could be required to purchase natural gas or coal at higher prices, implement its natural gas curtailment program filed with the MPSC, or purchase replacement power at higher prices.Unplanned outages or maintenance could be costly for CMS Energy or Consumers.Unforeseen outages or maintenance of the electric and gas delivery systems, power plants, gas infrastructure including storage facilities and compression stations, wind energy or solar equipment, and energy products owned in whole or in part by CMS Energy or Consumers may be required for many reasons. When unplanned outages occur, CMS Energy and Consumers will not only incur unexpected maintenance expenses, but may also have to make spot market purchases of electric and gas commodities that may exceed CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ expected cost of generation or gas supply, be forced to curtail services, or retire a given asset if the cost or timing of the maintenance is not reasonable and prudent. Unplanned generator outages could reduce the capacity credit CMS Energy or Consumers receives from MISO and could cause CMS Energy or Consumers to incur additional capacity costs in future years.General Risk Factors
The COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect each of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ business, results of operations, financial condition, capital investment program, liquidity, and cash flows.The COVID‑19 pandemic has had widespread impacts on people, businesses, economies, and financial markets globally, in the U.S., and in markets where CMS Energy and Consumers conduct business. These impacts include a reduction in economic activity, disruption to supply chains and operations, increased labor costs, reduced availability of labor, and reduced productivity.CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to counterparty risk.Adverse economic conditions or financial difficulties experienced by counterparties with whom CMS Energy and Consumers do business could impair the ability of these counterparties to pay for 46Table of ContentsCMS Energy’s and Consumers’ services and/or fulfill their contractual obligations, including performance and payment of damages. CMS Energy and Consumers depend on these counterparties to remit payments and perform contracted services in a timely and adequate fashion. Any delay or default in payment or performance, including inadequate performance, of contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers.Volatility and disruptions in capital and credit markets could have a negative impact on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ lenders, vendors, contractors, suppliers, customers, and other counterparties, causing them to fail to meet their obligations. CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to significant reputational risks.CMS Energy and Consumers could suffer negative impacts to their reputations as a result of operational incidents, violations of corporate policies, regulatory violations, inappropriate use of social media, or other events. Reputational damage could have a material adverse effect and could result in negative customer perception and increased regulatory oversight.A work interruption or other union actions could adversely affect Consumers.At December 31, 2022, unions represent 42 percent of Consumers’ employees. Consumers’ union agreements expire in 2025. If these employees were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, Consumers could experience a significant disruption in its operations and higher ongoing labor costs.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ results of operations.In some areas, competition for skilled employees is high and if CMS Energy and Consumers were unable to match skill sets to future needs, they could encounter operating challenges and increased costs. These challenges could include a lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and delays in skill development. Additionally, higher costs could result from the use of contractors to replace employees, loss of productivity, and safety incidents. Failing to train replacement employees adequately and to transfer internal knowledge and expertise could adversely affect CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ ability to manage and operate their businesses"
10,CMS,CMS ENERGY CORP,2022-02-10,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to a variety of factors, often beyond their control, that are difficult to predict and that involve uncertainties that may materially adversely affect CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ business, liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that management believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect CMS Energy or Consumers. The risk factors described in the following sections, as well as the other information included in this report and in other documents filed with the SEC, should be considered carefully before making an investment in securities of CMS Energy or Consumers. Risk factors of Consumers are also risk factors of CMS Energy.Investment/Financial RisksCMS Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service obligations.Due to its holding company structure, CMS Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other payment obligations. If sufficient dividends were not paid to CMS Energy by its subsidiaries, CMS Energy might not be able to generate the funds necessary to fulfill its payment obligations.Consumers’ ability to pay dividends or acquire its own stock from CMS Energy is limited by restrictions contained in Consumers’ preferred stock provisions and potentially by other legal restrictions, such as certain terms in its articles of incorporation and FERC requirements.CMS Energy has indebtedness that could limit its financial flexibility and its ability to meet its debt service obligations.The level of CMS Energy’s present and future indebtedness could have several important effects on its future operations, including, among others, that:•a significant portion of CMS Energy’s cash flow from operations could be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness and would not be available for other purposes•covenants contained in CMS Energy’s existing debt arrangements, which require it to meet certain financial tests, could affect its flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in its business•CMS Energy’s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate and other purposes could become limited•CMS Energy could be placed at a competitive disadvantage to its competitors that are less leveraged•CMS Energy’s vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions could increase•CMS Energy’s future credit ratings could fluctuateCMS Energy’s ability to meet its debt service obligations and to reduce its total indebtedness will depend on its future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, changes in laws or regulatory decisions, and financial, business, and other factors affecting its operations, many of which are beyond its control. CMS Energy cannot make assurances that its businesses will continue to 37Table of Contentsgenerate sufficient cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness, which could require CMS Energy to sell assets or obtain additional financing.CMS Energy and Consumers have financing needs and could be unable to obtain bank financing or access the capital markets.CMS Energy and Consumers rely on the capital markets, as well as on bank syndications, to meet their financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs not otherwise funded internally.Disruptions in the capital and credit markets, or the inability to obtain required FERC authorization for issuances of securities including debt, could adversely affect CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ access to liquidity needed for their businesses. Any liquidity disruption could require CMS Energy and Consumers to take measures to conserve cash including, but not limited to, deferring capital expenditures, changing commodity purchasing strategies to avoid collateral-posting requirements, and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases, dividend payments, or other discretionary uses of cash.Entering into new financings is subject in part to capital market receptivity to utility industry securities in general and to CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ securities in particular. CMS Energy and Consumers continue to explore financing opportunities to supplement their respective financial strategies. These potential opportunities include refinancing and/or issuing new debt, issuing CMS Energy preferred stock and/or common equity, or entering into commercial paper, bank financing, and leasing arrangements. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot guarantee the capital markets’ acceptance of their securities. CMS Energy may also, from time to time, repurchase (either in open market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions), redeem, or otherwise retire its outstanding debt. Such activities, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may or may not be material.Certain of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ securities and those of their affiliates are rated by various credit rating agencies. A reduction or withdrawal of one or more of its credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ ability to access capital on acceptable terms and maintain commodity lines of credit, could increase their cost of borrowing, and could cause CMS Energy or Consumers to reduce capital expenditures. If either or both were unable to maintain commodity lines of credit, CMS Energy or Consumers might have to post collateral or make prepayments to certain suppliers under existing contracts. Further, since Consumers provides dividends to CMS Energy, any adverse developments affecting Consumers that result in a lowering of its credit ratings could have an adverse effect on CMS Energy’s credit ratings.Market performance and other changes could decrease the value of employee benefit plan assets, which then could require substantial funding.The performance of various markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ pension and postretirement benefit plans. CMS Energy and Consumers have significant obligations under these plans and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which could fall below CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ forecasted return rates. A decline in the market value of the assets or a change in the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels could significantly increase the funding requirements of these obligations. Also, changes in demographics, including an increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, could significantly increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and postretirement benefit plans.38Table of ContentsIndustry/Regulatory RisksChanges to ROA could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses.Michigan law allows electric customers in Consumers’ service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount capped at ten percent of Consumers’ sales, with certain exceptions. The proportion of Consumers’ electric deliveries under the ROA program and on the ROA waiting list is over ten percent. Consumers’ rates are regulated by the MPSC, while alternative electric suppliers charge market-based rates, putting competitive pressure on Consumers’ electric supply. If the ROA limit were increased or if electric generation service in Michigan were deregulated, it could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers.Distributed energy resources could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses.Michigan law allows customers to use distributed energy resources for their electric energy needs. These distributed energy resources are connected to Consumers’ electric grid. The state distributed generation program is currently capped by the 2016 Energy Law at one percent of utilities’ peak loads, but Consumers has voluntarily agreed to increase the cap to two percent on its system. Consumers is required to purchase distributed generation customers’ excess generation at rates determined by the MPSC. Recent FERC policy will also soon allow many customer-owned behind-the-meter and grid-connected distributed energy resources to participate in and receive revenue from wholesale electricity markets. Increased customer use of distributed energy resources could result in a reduction of Consumers’ electric sales. Third parties’ operations of distributed energy resources could also potentially have a negative impact on the stability of the grid. An increase in customers’ use of distributed energy resources, and the rate structure for distributed energy resources customers’ use of Consumers’ system and Consumers’ purchases of their excess generation, could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers.CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation, which could have a material adverse effect on financial results.CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation. Consumers’ electric and gas retail rates are set by the MPSC and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization. If rate regulators fail to provide adequate rate relief, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers or Consumers’ plans for making significant capital investments.Orders of the MPSC could limit recovery of costs of providing service. These orders could also result in adverse regulatory treatment of other matters. For example, MPSC orders could prevent or curtail Consumers from shutting off non‑paying customers or could prevent or limit the implementation of a gas revenue mechanism.FERC authorizes certain subsidiaries of CMS Energy to sell wholesale electricity at market-based rates. Failure of these subsidiaries to maintain this FERC authority could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Transmission rates paid by Consumers and other CMS Energy subsidiaries are also set by FERC, as are the tariff terms governing the participation of Consumers and other CMS Energy subsidiaries in FERC-regulated wholesale electricity markets operated by regional transmission organizations and independent system operators such as MISO and PJM. At least one CMS Energy subsidiary participates in the wholesale electricity markets operated by ERCOT, over which FERC has limited control.39Table of ContentsThe various risks associated with the MPSC and FERC regulation of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses, which include the risk of adverse decisions in any number of rate or regulatory proceedings before either agency, as well as judicial proceedings challenging any agency decisions, could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers. Changes to the tariffs or business practice manuals of certain wholesale market operators such as MISO, PJM, or ERCOT could also have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers.Utility regulation, state or federal legislation, and compliance could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses.CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to, or affected by, extensive utility regulation and state and federal legislation. If it were determined that CMS Energy or Consumers failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations, they could become subject to fines, penalties, or disallowed costs, or be required to implement additional compliance, cleanup, or remediation programs, the cost of which could be material. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the impact of new laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices by federal or state agencies or wholesale electricity market operators, or challenges or changes to present laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices and the interpretation of any adoption or change. Furthermore, any state or federal legislation concerning CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ operations could also have a material adverse effect.FERC, through NERC and its delegated regional entities, oversees reliability of certain portions of the electric grid. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the impact of FERC orders or actions of NERC and its regional entities on electric system reliability. Additionally, national gas pipeline infrastructure has recently been under scrutiny following disruptions related to extreme weather and cyber incidents. In 2021, the Transportation Security Administration issued two mandatory security directives related to natural gas pipelines that apply to Consumers. Additional regulation in this area could adversely affect Consumers’ gas operations.CMS Energy and Consumers have announced an ambitious plan to reduce their impact on climate change. Achieving this plan depends on numerous factors, many of which are outside of their control.Consumers has announced a long-term strategy for delivering clean, reliable, resilient, and affordable energy, including a plan to end coal use in 2025 as set forth in the 2021 IRP. The MPSC, FERC, other regulatory authorities, or other third parties may prohibit, delay, impair, or deny approval or consent of the 2021 IRP and some or all of the 2021 IRP-associated natural gas-fueled plant acquisitions, or deny reasonable rate recovery of the undepreciated plant balances associated with the retirement of coal-fueled plants necessary to proceed with the 2021 IRP. Consumers may be unable to acquire, site, and/or permit some or all of the generation capacity proposed in the 2021 IRP. Consumers’ ability to implement the 2021 IRP may be affected by global supply chain disruptions and changes in the cost, availability, and supply of generation capacity. Advancements in technology related to items such as battery storage and electric vehicles may not become commercially available or economically feasible as projected in the 2021 IRP. Customer programs such as energy efficiency and demand response may not realize the projected levels of customer participation. CMS Energy and Consumers could suffer financial loss, reputational damage, litigation, or other negative repercussions if they are unable to achieve their ambitious plan.Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact CMS Energy and Consumers. CMS Energy and Consumers are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate their obligations to taxing 40Table of Contentsauthorities. The tax obligations include income taxes, real estate taxes, sales and use taxes, employment-related taxes, and ongoing issues related to these tax matters. The judgments include determining reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken and may be subject to challenge by the IRS and/or other taxing authorities. Unfavorable settlements of any of the issues related to these reserves or other tax matters at CMS Energy or Consumers could have a material adverse effect. Additionally, changes in federal, state, or local tax rates or other changes in tax laws could have adverse impacts.CMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers, must comply with the Dodd-Frank Act and its related regulations.The Dodd-Frank Act provides for regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of certain commodity-related contracts. Although CMS Energy, Consumers, and certain subsidiaries of CMS Enterprises qualify for an end-user exception from mandatory clearing of commodity-related swaps, these regulations could affect the ability of these entities to participate in these markets and could add additional regulatory oversight over their contracting activities.CMS Energy and Consumers could incur substantial costs to comply with environmental requirements.CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to costly and stringent environmental regulations that will likely require additional significant capital expenditures for CCR disposal and storage, cooling water intake equipment, effluent treatment, and PCB remediation. In addition, regulatory action on PFAS at the state and/or federal level could cause CMS Energy and Consumers to further test and remediate some sites if PFAS is present at certain levels. Present and reasonably anticipated state and federal environmental statutes and regulations will continue to have a material effect on CMS Energy and Consumers.CMS Energy and Consumers have interests in fossil-fuel-fired power plants, other types of power plants, and natural gas systems that emit greenhouse gases. Federal and state environmental laws and rules, as well as international accords and treaties, could require CMS Energy and Consumers to install additional equipment for emission controls, undertake heat-rate improvement projects, purchase carbon emissions allowances, curtail operations, invest in generating capacity with fewer carbon dioxide emissions, or take other significant steps to manage or lower the emission of greenhouse gases.The following risks related to climate change, emissions, and environmental regulations could also have a material adverse impact on CMS Energy and Consumers:•litigation originated by third parties against CMS Energy or Consumers due to CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ greenhouse gas or other emissions or CCR disposal and storage•impairment of CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ reputation due to their greenhouse gas or other emissions and public perception of their response to potential environmental regulations, rules, and legislation•extreme weather conditions, such as severe storms or flooding, that may affect customer demand, company operations, or assetsConsumers expects to collect fully from its customers, through the ratemaking process, expenditures incurred to comply with environmental regulations, but cannot guarantee this outcome. If Consumers were unable to recover these expenditures from customers in rates, CMS Energy or Consumers could be required to seek significant additional financing to fund these expenditures.41Table of ContentsFor additional information regarding compliance with environmental regulations, see Item 1. Business—CMS Energy and Consumers Environmental Strategy and Compliance and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Outlook.CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses could be affected adversely by any delay in meeting environmental requirements.A delay or failure by CMS Energy or Consumers to obtain or maintain any necessary environmental permits or approvals to satisfy any applicable environmental regulatory requirements or install emission or pollution control equipment could:•prevent the construction of new facilities•prevent the continued operation and sale of energy from existing facilities•prevent the suspension of operations at existing facilities•prevent the modification of existing facilities•result in significant additional costsCMS Energy and Consumers expect to incur additional substantial costs related to remediation of legacy environmental sites.Consumers expects to incur additional substantial costs related to the remediation of its former MGP sites and other response activity costs at a number of other sites, including, but not limited to, sites of retired coal-fueled electric generating units, under NREPA and CERCLA. Consumers believes these costs should be recoverable in rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome.Business/Operations RisksThere are risks associated with Consumers’ substantial capital investment program planned for the next ten years.Consumers’ planned investments include the construction or acquisition of electric generation, electric and gas infrastructure, conversions and expansions, environmental controls, electric grid modernization technology, and other electric and gas investments to upgrade delivery systems, as well as decommissioning of older facilities. The success of these capital investments depends on or could be affected by a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to:•effective pre-acquisition evaluation of asset values, future operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities, and other factors beyond Consumers’ control•effective cost and schedule management of new capital projects•availability of qualified construction personnel, both internal and contracted•changes in commodity and other prices, applicable tariffs, and/or material and equipment availability•governmental approvals and permitting42Table of Contents•operational performance•changes in environmental, legislative, and regulatory requirements•regulatory cost recovery•inflation of labor rates•increases in lead times and disruptions in supply chain distribution•barriers to accessing key materials for renewable projects (solar, battery, and other key equipment) created by geopolitical relations and U.S. relations with ChinaIt is possible that adverse events associated with these factors could have a material adverse effect on Consumers.CMS Energy and Consumers could be affected adversely by legacy litigation and retained liabilities.The agreements that CMS Energy and Consumers enter into for the sale of assets customarily include provisions whereby they are required to:•retain specified preexisting liabilities, such as for taxes, pensions, or environmental conditions•indemnify the buyers against specified risks, including the inaccuracy of representations and warranties that CMS Energy and Consumers make•make payments to the buyers depending on the outcome of post-closing adjustments, litigation, audits, or other reviews, including claims resulting from attempts by foreign or domestic governments to assess taxes on past operations or transactionsMany of these contingent liabilities can remain open for extended periods of time after the sales are closed. Depending on the extent to which the buyers might ultimately seek to enforce their rights under these contractual provisions, and the resolution of any disputes concerning them, there could be a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.In 2002, CMS Energy sold its oil, gas, and methanol investments in Equatorial Guinea. The government of Equatorial Guinea claims that, in connection with the sale, CMS Energy owes $152 million in taxes, plus substantial penalties and interest that could be up to or exceed the amount of the taxes claimed. In 2015, the matter was proceeding to formal arbitration; however, since then, the government of Equatorial Guinea has stopped communicating with CMS Energy. CMS Energy has concluded that the government’s tax claim is without merit and believes the likelihood of material loss to be remote, but cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of the matter.Consumers is exposed to risks related to general economic conditions in its service territories.Consumers’ electric and gas utility businesses are affected by the economic conditions impacting the customers they serve. If the Michigan economy becomes sluggish or declines, Consumers could experience reduced demand for electricity or natural gas that could result in decreased earnings and cash flow. In addition, economic conditions in Consumers’ service territory affect its collections of accounts receivable and levels of lost or stolen gas.Consumers is exposed to changes in customer usage that could impact financial results.Technology advances, government incentives and subsidies, and recent regulatory decisions could increase the cost effectiveness of customer-owned methods of producing electricity and managing energy use resulting in reduced load, cross subsidization, and increased costs.Customers could also reduce their consumption through demand-side energy conservation and energy waste reduction programs.43Table of ContentsCMS Energy’s and Consumers’ energy sales and operations are affected by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions from year to year.CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment, while peak demand for natural gas typically occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as heating fuel. Accordingly, CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ overall results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Mild temperatures during the summer cooling season and winter heating season as well as the impact of extreme weather events on Consumers’ system could have a material adverse effect.CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to information security risks, risks of unauthorized access to their systems, and technology failures.In the regular course of business, CMS Energy and Consumers handle a range of sensitive confidential security and customer information. In addition, CMS Energy and Consumers operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information and control technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite implementation of security measures, technology systems, including disaster recovery and backup systems, are vulnerable to failure, cyber crime, unauthorized access, and being disabled. These events could impact the reliability of electric generation and electric and gas delivery and also subject CMS Energy and Consumers to financial harm. Cyber crime, which includes the use of malware, computer viruses, and other means for disruption or unauthorized access against companies, including CMS Energy and Consumers, is increasing in frequency, scope, and potential impact. While CMS Energy and Consumers have not been subject to cyber incidents that have had a material impact on their operations to date, their security measures in place may be insufficient to prevent a major cyber incident in the future. If technology systems, including disaster recovery and backup systems, were to fail or be breached, CMS Energy and Consumers might not be able to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive confidential and proprietary data could be compromised. In addition, because CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ generation, transmission, and distribution systems are part of an interconnected system, a disruption caused by a cyber incident at another utility, electric generator, system operator, or commodity supplier could also adversely affect CMS Energy or Consumers.A variety of technological tools and systems, including both company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties, support critical functions. The failure of these technologies, including backup systems, or the inability of CMS Energy and Consumers to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded, or integrated into other technologies, could hinder their business operations. CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses have liability risks.Consumers’ electric and gas delivery systems, power plants, gas infrastructure including storage facilities, wind energy or solar equipment, and energy products, and the independent power plants owned in whole or in part by CMS Energy could be involved in incidents, failures, or accidents that result in injury, loss of life, or property loss to customers, employees, or the public. Although CMS Energy and Consumers have insurance coverage for many potential incidents (subject to deductibles, limitations, and self-insurance amounts that could be material), depending upon the nature or severity of any incident, failure, or accident, CMS Energy or Consumers could suffer financial loss, reputational damage, and negative repercussions from regulatory agencies or other public authorities.44Table of ContentsCMS Energy and Consumers are subject to risks that are beyond their control, including but not limited to natural disasters, civil unrest, terrorist attacks and related acts of war, cyber incidents, vandalism, and other catastrophic events.Natural disasters, severe weather, wars, terrorist acts, civil unrest, vandalism, theft, cyber incidents, pandemics, and other catastrophic events could result in severe damage to CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ assets beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies (which are subject to deductibles, limitations, and self-insurance amounts that could be material), could require CMS Energy and Consumers to incur significant upfront costs, and could severely disrupt operations, resulting in loss of service to customers. There is also a risk that regulators could, after the fact, conclude that Consumers’ preparedness or response to such an event was inadequate and take adverse actions as a result.Energy risk management strategies might not be effective in managing fuel and electricity pricing risks, which could result in unanticipated liabilities to CMS Energy and Consumers or increased volatility in their earnings.CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to changes in market prices for commodities including, but not limited to, natural gas, coal, electric capacity, electric energy, emission allowances, gasoline, diesel fuel, and RECs. CMS Energy and Consumers manage commodity price risk using established policies and procedures, and they may use various contracts to manage this risk, including swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts. No assurance can be made that these strategies will be successful in managing CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ risk or that they will not result in net liabilities to CMS Energy or Consumers as a result of future volatility.A substantial portion of Consumers’ operating expenses for its electric generating plants and vehicle fleet consists of the costs of obtaining these commodities. The contracts associated with Consumers’ fuel for electric generation and purchased power are executed in conjunction with the PSCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover prudently incurred costs associated with its positions in these commodities. If the MPSC determined that any of these contracts or related contracting policies were imprudent, recovery of these costs could be disallowed.Natural gas prices in particular have been historically volatile. Consumers routinely enters into contracts for natural gas to mitigate exposure to the risks of demand, market effects of weather, and changes in commodity prices associated with the gas distribution business. These contracts are executed in conjunction with the GCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover prudently incurred costs associated with its natural gas positions. If the MPSC determined that any of these contracts or related contracting policies were imprudent, recovery of these costs could be disallowed.CMS Energy and Consumers do not always hedge any or all of the exposure of their operations from commodity price volatility. Furthermore, the ability to hedge exposure to commodity price volatility depends on liquid commodity markets. As a result, to the extent the commodity markets are illiquid, CMS Energy and Consumers might not be able to execute their risk management strategies, which could result in larger unhedged positions than preferred at a given time. To the extent that unhedged positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices could have a negative effect on CMS Energy and Consumers. Changes in laws that limit CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ ability to hedge could also have a negative effect on CMS Energy and Consumers.Consumers might not be able to obtain an adequate supply of natural gas or coal, which could limit its ability to operate its electric generation facilities or serve its natural gas customers.Consumers has natural gas and coal supply and transportation contracts in place for the natural gas and coal it requires for its electric generating capacity. Consumers also has interstate transportation and 45Table of Contentssupply agreements in place to facilitate delivery of natural gas to its customers. Apart from the contractual and monetary remedies available to Consumers in the event of a counterparty’s failure to perform under any of these contracts, there can be no assurances that the counterparties to these contracts will fulfill their obligations to provide natural gas or coal to Consumers. The counterparties under the agreements could experience financial or operational problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to Consumers. In addition, counterparties under these contracts might not be required to supply natural gas or coal to Consumers under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster or severe weather.If Consumers were unable to obtain its supply requirements, it could be required to purchase natural gas or coal at higher prices or implement its natural gas curtailment program filed with the MPSC.Unplanned outages or maintenance could be costly for CMS Energy or Consumers.Unforeseen outages or maintenance of the electric and gas delivery systems, power plants, gas infrastructure including storage facilities and compression stations, wind energy or solar equipment, and energy products owned in whole or in part by CMS Energy or Consumers may be required for many reasons. When unplanned outages occur, CMS Energy and Consumers will not only incur unexpected maintenance expenses, but may also have to make spot market purchases of electric and gas commodities that may exceed CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ expected cost of generation or gas supply, be forced to curtail services, or retire a given asset if the cost or timing of the maintenance is not reasonable and prudent. Unplanned generator outages could reduce the capacity credit CMS Energy or Consumers receives from MISO and could cause CMS Energy or Consumers to incur additional capacity costs in future years.The COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect each of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ business, results of operations, financial condition, capital investment program, liquidity, and cash flows.The COVID‑19 pandemic has had widespread impacts on people, businesses, economies, and financial markets globally, in the U.S., and in markets where CMS Energy and Consumers conduct business. Future impacts of the pandemic could include a prolonged reduction in economic activity, extended disruption to supply chains and operations, increased labor costs, and reduced availability of labor and productivity. CMS Energy and Consumers provide essential services, which means that CMS Energy and Consumers must keep employees, who operate facilities or interact with customers, safe and minimize unnecessary risk of exposure to COVID‑19. CMS Energy and Consumers have taken extra precautions in an effort to protect the health of employees working in the field and in CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ facilities. CMS Energy and Consumers have also implemented masking and quarantine procedures, in accordance with CDC guidance. This remains an evolving situation; CMS Energy and Consumers will continue to monitor developments and will take additional necessary precautions in order to keep employees, customers, contractors, and communities safe.The ultimate impact of the COVID‑19 pandemic depends on factors beyond CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ knowledge or control. The degree to which COVID‑19 will ultimately impact CMS Energy and Consumers will depend in part on future developments, including the severity and duration of  COVID-19 and its variants, actions or inactions that may be taken by governmental authorities, including, but not limited to, COVID-19 vaccination and testing requirements, and to what extent and when normal economic and operational conditions can resume.46Table of ContentsGeneral Risk Factors
CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to counterparty risk.Adverse economic conditions or financial difficulties experienced by counterparties with whom CMS Energy and Consumers do business could impair the ability of these counterparties to pay for CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ services and/or fulfill their contractual obligations, including performance and payment of damages. CMS Energy and Consumers depend on these counterparties to remit payments and perform contracted services in a timely fashion. Any delay or default in payment or performance of contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers.Volatility and disruptions in capital and credit markets could have a negative impact on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ lenders, vendors, contractors, suppliers, customers, and other counterparties, causing them to fail to meet their obligations. CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to significant reputational risks.CMS Energy and Consumers could suffer negative impacts to their reputations as a result of operational incidents, violations of corporate policies, regulatory violations, inappropriate use of social media, or other events. Reputational damage could have a material adverse effect and could result in negative customer perception and increased regulatory oversight.A work interruption or other union actions could adversely affect Consumers.Unions represent 42 percent of Consumers’ employees. Consumers’ union agreements expire in 2025. If these employees were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, Consumers could experience a significant disruption in its operations and higher ongoing labor costs.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ results of operations.In some areas, competition for skilled employees is high and if CMS Energy and Consumers were unable to match skill sets to future needs, they could encounter operating challenges and increased costs. These challenges could include a lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and delays in skill development. Additionally, higher costs could result from the use of contractors to replace employees, loss of productivity, and safety incidents. Failing to train replacement employees adequately and to transfer internal knowledge and expertise could adversely affect CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ ability to manage and operate their businesses"
7,CMS,CMS ENERGY CORP,2021-02-11,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to a variety of factors, often beyond their control, that are difficult to predict and that involve uncertainties that may materially adversely affect CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ business, liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that management believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect CMS Energy or Consumers. The risk factors described in the following sections, as well as the other information included in this report and in other documents filed with the SEC, should be considered carefully before making an investment in securities of CMS Energy or Consumers. Risk factors of Consumers are also risk factors of CMS Energy.Investment/Financial RisksCMS Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service obligations.Due to its holding company structure, CMS Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other payment obligations. If sufficient dividends were not paid to CMS Energy by its subsidiaries, CMS Energy might not be able to generate the funds necessary to fulfill its payment obligations.Consumers’ ability to pay dividends or acquire its own stock from CMS Energy is limited by restrictions contained in Consumers’ preferred stock provisions and potentially by other legal restrictions, such as certain terms in its articles of incorporation and FERC requirements.CMS Energy has indebtedness that could limit its financial flexibility and its ability to meet its debt service obligations.The level of CMS Energy’s present and future indebtedness could have several important effects on its future operations, including, among others, that:•a significant portion of CMS Energy’s cash flow from operations could be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness and would not be available for other purposes36Table of Contents•covenants contained in CMS Energy’s existing debt arrangements, which require it to meet certain financial tests, could affect its flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in its business•CMS Energy’s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate and other purposes could become limited•CMS Energy could be placed at a competitive disadvantage to its competitors that are less leveraged•CMS Energy’s vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions could increase•CMS Energy’s future credit ratings could fluctuateCMS Energy’s ability to meet its debt service obligations and to reduce its total indebtedness will depend on its future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, changes in laws or regulatory decisions, and financial, business, and other factors affecting its operations, many of which are beyond its control. CMS Energy cannot make assurances that its businesses will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness, which could require CMS Energy to sell assets or obtain additional financing.CMS Energy and Consumers have financing needs and could be unable to obtain bank financing or access the capital markets.CMS Energy and Consumers rely on the capital markets, as well as on bank syndications, to meet their financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs not otherwise funded internally.Disruptions in the capital and credit markets, or the inability to obtain required FERC authorization for issuances of securities including debt, could adversely affect CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ access to liquidity needed for their businesses. Any liquidity disruption could require CMS Energy and Consumers to take measures to conserve cash including, but not limited to, deferring capital expenditures, changing commodity purchasing strategies to avoid collateral-posting requirements, and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases, dividend payments, or other discretionary uses of cash.Entering into new financings is subject in part to capital market receptivity to utility industry securities in general and to CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ securities in particular. CMS Energy and Consumers continue to explore financing opportunities to supplement their respective financial strategies. These potential opportunities include refinancing and/or issuing new debt, issuing CMS Energy preferred stock and/or common equity, or entering into commercial paper, bank financing, and leasing arrangements. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot guarantee the capital markets’ acceptance of their securities. CMS Energy may also, from time to time, repurchase (either in open market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions), redeem, or otherwise retire its outstanding debt. Such activities, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may or may not be material.Certain of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ securities and those of their affiliates are rated by various credit rating agencies. A reduction or withdrawal of one or more of its credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ ability to access capital on acceptable terms and maintain commodity lines of credit, could increase their cost of borrowing, and could cause CMS Energy or Consumers to reduce capital expenditures. If either or both were unable to maintain commodity lines of credit, CMS Energy or Consumers might have to post collateral or make prepayments to certain suppliers under existing contracts. Further, since Consumers provides dividends to CMS Energy, any adverse developments affecting Consumers that result in a lowering of its credit ratings could have an adverse effect on CMS Energy’s credit ratings.37Table of ContentsMarket performance and other changes could decrease the value of employee benefit plan assets, which then could require substantial funding.The performance of various markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ pension and postretirement benefit plans. CMS Energy and Consumers have significant obligations under these plans and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which could fall below CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ forecasted return rates. A decline in the market value of the assets or a change in the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels could significantly increase the funding requirements of these obligations. Also, changes in demographics, including an increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, could significantly increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and postretirement benefit plans.Industry/Regulatory RisksChanges to ROA could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses.Michigan law allows electric customers in Consumers’ service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount capped at ten percent of Consumers’ sales, with certain exceptions. The proportion of Consumers’ electric deliveries under the ROA program and on the ROA waiting list is over ten percent. Consumers’ rates are regulated by the MPSC, while alternative electric suppliers charge market-based rates, putting competitive pressure on Consumers’ electric supply. If the ROA limit were increased or if electric generation service in Michigan were deregulated, it could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers.CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation, which could have an adverse effect on financial results.CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation. Consumers’ electric and gas retail rates are set by the MPSC and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization. If rate regulators fail to provide adequate rate relief, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers or Consumers’ plans for making significant capital investments.Orders of the MPSC could limit recovery of costs of providing service. These orders could also result in adverse regulatory treatment of other matters. For example, MPSC orders could prevent or curtail Consumers from shutting off non‑paying customers or could prevent or limit the implementation of a gas revenue mechanism.FERC authorizes certain subsidiaries of CMS Energy to sell electricity at market-based rates. Failure of these subsidiaries to maintain this FERC authority could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Transmission rates are also set by FERC.The various risks associated with the MPSC and FERC regulation of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses, which include the risk of adverse decisions in any number of rate or regulatory proceedings before either agency, as well as judicial proceedings challenging any agency decisions, could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers.38Table of ContentsUtility regulation, state or federal legislation, and compliance could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses.CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to, or affected by, extensive utility regulation and state and federal legislation. If it were determined that CMS Energy or Consumers failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations, they could become subject to fines, penalties, or disallowed costs, or be required to implement additional compliance, cleanup, or remediation programs, the cost of which could be material. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the impact of new laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices by federal or state agencies, or challenges or changes to present laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices and the interpretation of any adoption or change. Furthermore, any state or federal legislation concerning CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ operations could also have a material adverse effect.FERC, through NERC, oversees reliability of certain portions of the electric grid. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the impact of FERC orders regarding electric system reliability.Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact CMS Energy and Consumers.CMS Energy and Consumers are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. The tax obligations include income taxes, real estate taxes, sales and use taxes, employment-related taxes, and ongoing issues related to these tax matters. The judgments include determining reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken and may be subject to challenge by the IRS and/or other taxing authorities. Unfavorable settlements of any of the issues related to these reserves or other tax matters at CMS Energy or Consumers could have a material adverse effect. Additionally, changes in federal, state, or local tax rates or other changes in tax laws could have adverse impacts.CMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers and EnerBank, must comply with the Dodd-Frank Act and its related regulations, which are subject to change and could involve material costs or affect operations.Regulations that are intended to implement the Dodd-Frank Act have been and are still being adopted and modified by the appropriate agencies. The Dodd-Frank Act added a new Section 13 to the Bank Holding Company Act. Known, together with its implementing regulations, as the Volcker Rule, it generally restricts certain banking entities (such as EnerBank) and their subsidiaries or affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading activities and from owning equity in or sponsoring any private equity funds or hedge funds (or certain other private issuing entities). The activities of CMS Energy and its subsidiaries (including EnerBank) have not been and are not expected to be materially affected by the Volcker Rule; however, they are restricted from engaging in proprietary trading, investing in third‑party hedge or private equity funds (and certain other private issuing entities), and sponsoring these funds (and entities) in the future unless CMS Energy qualifies for an exemption from the rule. CMS Energy and its subsidiaries are also subject to certain ongoing compliance requirements pursuant to the regulations. CMS Energy cannot predict the full impact of the Volcker Rule, including any impact resulting from changes to implementing regulations, on CMS Energy’s or EnerBank’s operations or financial condition.All companies that directly or indirectly control an FDIC-insured bank are required to serve as a source of financial strength for that institution. As a result, CMS Energy could be called upon by the FDIC to infuse additional capital into EnerBank to the extent that EnerBank fails to satisfy its capital requirements. In addition, CMS Energy is contractually required (i) to make cash capital contributions to EnerBank in the event that EnerBank does not maintain required minimum capital ratios and (ii) to provide EnerBank 39Table of Contentsfinancial support, in an amount and duration as may be necessary for EnerBank to meet the cash needs of its depositors and other operations. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of certain commodity-related contracts. Although CMS Energy, Consumers, EnerBank, and certain subsidiaries of CMS Enterprises qualify for an end-user exception from mandatory clearing of commodity-related swaps, these regulations could affect the ability of these entities to participate in these markets and could add additional regulatory oversight over their contracting activities.CMS Energy and Consumers could incur substantial costs to comply with environmental requirements.CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to costly and stringent environmental regulations that will likely require additional significant capital expenditures for CCR disposal and storage, cooling water intake equipment, effluent treatment, and PCB remediation. In addition, regulatory action on PFAS at the state and/or federal level could cause CMS Energy and Consumers to further test and remediate some sites if PFAS is present at certain levels. Present and reasonably anticipated state and federal environmental statutes and regulations will continue to have a material effect on CMS Energy and Consumers.CMS Energy and Consumers have interests in fossil-fuel-fired power plants and other types of power plants that produce greenhouse gases. Federal and state environmental laws and rules, as well as international accords and treaties, could require CMS Energy and Consumers to install additional equipment for emission controls, undertake heat-rate improvement projects, purchase carbon emissions allowances, curtail operations, invest in generating capacity with fewer carbon dioxide emissions, or take other significant steps to manage or lower the emission of greenhouse gases.The following risks related to climate change, emissions, and environmental regulations could also have a material adverse impact on CMS Energy and Consumers:•litigation originated by third parties against CMS Energy or Consumers due to CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ greenhouse gas or other emissions or CCR disposal and storage•impairment of CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ reputation due to their greenhouse gas or other emissions and public perception of their response to potential environmental regulations, rules, and legislation•extreme weather conditions, such as severe storms or flooding, that may affect customer demand, company operations, or assetsConsumers retired seven smaller coal-fueled electric generating units in 2016. Consumers may encounter environmental conditions that will need to be addressed in a timely fashion with state and federal environmental regulators as facilities and equipment on these sites are taken out of service.Consumers expects to collect fully from its customers, through the ratemaking process, expenditures incurred to comply with environmental regulations, but cannot guarantee this outcome. If Consumers were unable to recover these expenditures from customers in rates, CMS Energy or Consumers could be required to seek significant additional financing to fund these expenditures.For additional information regarding compliance with environmental regulations, see Item 1. Business—CMS Energy and Consumers Environmental Strategy and Compliance and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Outlook—Consumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties and Consumers Gas Utility Outlook and Uncertainties.40Table of ContentsCMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses could be affected adversely by any delay in meeting environmental requirements.A delay or failure by CMS Energy or Consumers to obtain or maintain any necessary environmental permits or approvals to satisfy any applicable environmental regulatory requirements or install emission or pollution control equipment could:•prevent the construction of new facilities•prevent the continued operation and sale of energy from existing facilities•prevent the suspension of operations at existing facilities•prevent the modification of existing facilities•result in significant additional costsCMS Energy and Consumers expect to incur additional substantial costs related to remediation of legacy environmental sites.Consumers expects to incur additional substantial costs related to the remediation of its former MGP sites and other response activity costs at a number of other sites under NREPA and CERCLA. Consumers believes these costs should be recoverable in rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome.Business/Operations RisksThere are risks associated with Consumers’ substantial capital investment program planned for the next ten years.Consumers’ planned investments include the construction or acquisition of electric generation, electric and gas infrastructure, conversions and expansions, environmental controls, electric grid modernization technology, and other electric and gas investments to upgrade delivery systems, as well as decommissioning of older facilities. The success of these capital investments depends on or could be affected by a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to:•effective pre-acquisition evaluation of asset values, future operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities, and other factors beyond Consumers’ control•effective cost and schedule management of new capital projects•availability of qualified construction personnel•changes in commodity and other prices•governmental approvals and permitting•operational performance•changes in environmental, legislative, and regulatory requirements•regulatory cost recoveryIt is possible that adverse events associated with these factors could have a material adverse effect on Consumers.41Table of ContentsCMS Energy and Consumers could be affected adversely by legacy litigation and retained liabilities.The agreements that CMS Energy and Consumers enter into for the sale of assets customarily include provisions whereby they are required to:•retain specified preexisting liabilities, such as for taxes, pensions, or environmental conditions•indemnify the buyers against specified risks, including the inaccuracy of representations and warranties that CMS Energy and Consumers make•make payments to the buyers depending on the outcome of post-closing adjustments, litigation, audits, or other reviews, including claims resulting from attempts by foreign or domestic governments to assess taxes on past operations or transactionsMany of these contingent liabilities can remain open for extended periods of time after the sales are closed. Depending on the extent to which the buyers might ultimately seek to enforce their rights under these contractual provisions, and the resolution of any disputes concerning them, there could be a material adverse effect on CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.In 2002, CMS Energy sold its oil, gas, and methanol investments in Equatorial Guinea. The government of Equatorial Guinea claims that, in connection with the sale, CMS Energy owes $152 million in taxes, plus substantial penalties and interest that could be up to or exceed the amount of the taxes claimed. In 2015, the matter was proceeding to formal arbitration; however, since then, the government of Equatorial Guinea has stopped communicating. CMS Energy has concluded that the government’s tax claim is without merit and will continue to contest the claim, but cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of the matter.Consumers is exposed to risks related to general economic conditions in its service territories.Consumers’ electric and gas utility businesses are affected by the economic conditions impacting the customers they serve. If the Michigan economy becomes sluggish or declines, Consumers could experience reduced demand for electricity or natural gas that could result in decreased earnings and cash flow. In addition, economic conditions in Consumers’ service territory affect its collections of accounts receivable and levels of lost or stolen gas.Consumers is exposed to changes in customer usage that could impact financial results.Technology advances, government incentives and subsidies, and recent regulatory decisions could increase the cost effectiveness of customer-owned methods of producing electricity and managing energy use resulting in reduced load, cross subsidization, and increased costs.Customers could also reduce their consumption through demand-side energy conservation and energy waste reduction programs.CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ energy sales and operations are affected by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions from year to year.CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment, while peak demand for natural gas typically occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as heating fuel. Accordingly, CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ overall results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Mild temperatures during the summer cooling season and winter heating season as well as the impact of extreme weather events on Consumers’ system could have a material adverse effect.42Table of ContentsCMS Energy and Consumers are subject to information security risks, risks of unauthorized access to their systems, and technology failures.In the regular course of business, CMS Energy and Consumers handle a range of sensitive confidential security and customer information. In addition, CMS Energy and Consumers operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information and control technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite implementation of security measures, technology systems, including disaster recovery and backup systems, are vulnerable to failure, cyber crime, unauthorized access, and being disabled. These events could impact the reliability of electric generation and electric and gas delivery and also subject CMS Energy and Consumers to financial harm. Cyber crime, which includes the use of malware, computer viruses, and other means for disruption or unauthorized access against companies, including CMS Energy and Consumers, is increasing in frequency, scope, and potential impact. While CMS Energy and Consumers have not been subject to cyber crime incidents that have had a material impact on their operations to date, their security measures in place may be insufficient to prevent a major cyber incident in the future. If technology systems, including disaster recovery and backup systems, were to fail or be breached, CMS Energy and Consumers might not be able to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive confidential and proprietary data could be compromised. In addition, because CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ generation, transmission, and distribution systems are part of an interconnected system, a disruption caused by a cyber incident at another utility, electric generator, system operator, or commodity supplier could also adversely affect CMS Energy or Consumers.A variety of technological tools and systems, including both company-owned IT and technological services provided by outside parties, support critical functions. The failure of these technologies, including backup systems, or the inability of CMS Energy and Consumers to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded, or integrated into other technologies, could hinder their business operations. A breach or failure of technology, including disaster recovery or backup systems, could also have a negative impact on CMS Energy’s banking subsidiary, EnerBank.CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ businesses have liability risks.Consumers’ electric and gas delivery systems, power plants, gas infrastructure including storage facilities, wind energy or solar equipment, and energy products, and the independent power plants owned in whole or in part by CMS Energy could be involved in incidents, failures, or accidents that result in injury, loss of life, or property loss to customers, employees, or the public. Although CMS Energy and Consumers have insurance coverage for many potential incidents (subject to deductibles, limitations, and self-insurance amounts that could be material), depending upon the nature or severity of any incident, failure, or accident, CMS Energy or Consumers could suffer financial loss, reputational damage, and negative repercussions from regulatory agencies or other public authorities.CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to risks that are beyond their control, including but not limited to natural disasters, civil unrest, terrorist attacks and related acts of war, cyber incidents, vandalism, and other catastrophic events.Natural disasters, severe weather, wars, terrorist acts, civil unrest, vandalism, theft, cyber incidents, pandemics, and other catastrophic events could result in severe damage to CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ assets beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies (which are subject to deductibles and limits), could require CMS Energy and Consumers to incur significant upfront costs, and could severely disrupt operations, resulting in loss of service to customers. There is also a risk that regulators could, after the fact, conclude that Consumers’ preparedness or response to such an event was inadequate and take adverse actions as a result.43Table of ContentsEnergy risk management strategies might not be effective in managing fuel and electricity pricing risks, which could result in unanticipated liabilities to CMS Energy and Consumers or increased volatility in their earnings.CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas, coal, electric capacity, electric energy, emission allowances, gasoline, diesel fuel, and RECs. CMS Energy and Consumers manage commodity price risk using established policies and procedures, and they may use various contracts to manage this risk, including swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts. No assurance can be made that these strategies will be successful in managing CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ risk or that they will not result in net liabilities to CMS Energy or Consumers as a result of future volatility.A substantial portion of Consumers’ operating expenses for its electric generating plants and vehicle fleet consists of the costs of obtaining these commodities. The contracts associated with Consumers’ fuel for electric generation and purchased power are executed in conjunction with the PSCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover prudently incurred costs associated with its positions in these commodities. If the MPSC determined that any of these contracts or related contracting policies were imprudent, recovery of these costs could be disallowed.Natural gas prices in particular have been historically volatile. Consumers routinely enters into contracts for natural gas to mitigate exposure to the risks of demand, market effects of weather, and changes in commodity prices associated with the gas distribution business. These contracts are executed in conjunction with the GCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover prudently incurred costs associated with its natural gas positions. If the MPSC determined that any of these contracts or related contracting policies were imprudent, recovery of these costs could be disallowed. CMS Energy and Consumers do not always hedge any or all of the exposure of their operations from commodity price volatility. Furthermore, the ability to hedge exposure to commodity price volatility depends on liquid commodity markets. As a result, to the extent the commodity markets are illiquid, CMS Energy and Consumers might not be able to execute their risk management strategies, which could result in larger unhedged positions than preferred at a given time. To the extent that unhedged positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices could have a negative effect on CMS Energy and Consumers. Changes in laws that limit CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ ability to hedge could also have a negative effect on CMS Energy and Consumers.Consumers might not be able to obtain an adequate supply of natural gas or coal, which could limit its ability to operate its electric generation facilities or serve its natural gas customers.Consumers has natural gas and coal supply and transportation contracts in place for the natural gas and coal it requires for its electric generating capacity. Consumers also has interstate transportation and supply agreements in place to facilitate delivery of natural gas to its customers. Apart from the contractual and monetary remedies available to Consumers in the event of a counterparty’s failure to perform under any of these contracts, there can be no assurances that the counterparties to these contracts will fulfill their obligations to provide natural gas or coal to Consumers. The counterparties under the agreements could experience financial or operational problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to Consumers. In addition, counterparties under these contracts might not be required to supply natural gas or coal to Consumers under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster or severe weather.If Consumers were unable to obtain its supply requirements, it could be required to purchase natural gas or coal at higher prices or implement its natural gas curtailment program filed with the MPSC.44Table of ContentsUnplanned outages or maintenance could be costly for CMS Energy or Consumers.Unforeseen outages or maintenance of the electric and gas delivery systems, power plants, gas infrastructure including storage facilities and compression stations, wind energy or solar equipment, and energy products owned in whole or in part by CMS Energy or Consumers may be required for many reasons. When unplanned outages occur, CMS Energy and Consumers will not only incur unexpected maintenance expenses, but may also have to make spot market purchases of electric and gas commodities that may exceed CMS Energy’s or Consumers’ expected cost of generation or gas supply, be forced to curtail services, or retire a given asset if the cost or timing of the maintenance is not reasonable and prudent. Unplanned generator outages could reduce the capacity credit CMS Energy or Consumers receives from MISO and could cause CMS Energy or Consumers to incur additional capacity costs in future years.The COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect each of CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ business, results of operations, financial condition, capital investment program, liquidity, and cash flows.The COVID‑19 pandemic has had widespread impacts on people, businesses, economies, and financial markets globally, in the U.S., and in markets where CMS Energy and Consumers conduct business. Future impacts of the pandemic could include a prolonged reduction in economic activity, extended disruption to supply chains and operations, and reduced availability of labor and productivity. CMS Energy and Consumers provide essential services, which means that CMS Energy and Consumers must keep employees, who operate facilities or interact with customers, safe and minimize unnecessary risk of exposure to COVID‑19. CMS Energy and Consumers have taken extra precautions in an effort to protect the health of employees working in the field and in CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ facilities. CMS Energy and Consumers have also implemented work-from-home policies where possible. This is an evolving situation; CMS Energy and Consumers will continue to monitor developments and will take additional necessary precautions in order to keep employees, customers, contractors, and communities safe.The ultimate impact of the COVID‑19 pandemic depends on factors beyond CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ knowledge or control. Consumers has experienced a decline in electric deliveries to commercial and industrial customers and increased uncollectible accounts. Over the long term, the pandemic could have numerous and significant adverse effects on CMS Energy and Consumers. Additionally, EnerBank could experience slower lending growth, higher loan write-offs, and increased loan modifications.CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict how the COVID‑19 pandemic will impact CMS Energy and Consumers. The degree to which COVID‑19 will impact CMS Energy and Consumers will depend in part on future developments, including the severity and duration of the outbreak, actions or inactions that may be taken by governmental authorities, and to what extent and when normal economic and operational conditions can resume.General Risk Factors
CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to counterparty risk.Adverse economic conditions or financial difficulties experienced by counterparties with whom CMS Energy and Consumers do business could impair the ability of these counterparties to pay for CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ services and/or fulfill their contractual obligations, including performance and payment of damages. CMS Energy and Consumers depend on these counterparties to remit payments and perform contracted services in a timely fashion. Any delay or default in payment or 45Table of Contentsperformance of contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy and Consumers.Volatility and disruptions in capital and credit markets could have a negative impact on CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ lenders, vendors, contractors, suppliers, customers, and other counterparties, causing them to fail to meet their obligations. Adverse economic conditions could also have a negative impact on the loan portfolio of CMS Energy’s banking subsidiary, EnerBank.CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to significant reputational risks.CMS Energy and Consumers could suffer negative impacts to their reputations as a result of operational incidents, violations of corporate policies, regulatory violations, inappropriate use of social media, or other events. Reputational damage could have a material adverse effect and could result in negative customer perception and increased regulatory oversight.A work interruption or other union actions could adversely affect Consumers.Unions represent 44 percent of Consumers’ employees. Consumers’ union agreements expire in 2025. If these employees were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, Consumers could experience a significant disruption in its operations and higher ongoing labor costs.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ results of operations.In some areas, competition for skilled employees is high and if CMS Energy and Consumers were unable to match skill sets to future needs, they could encounter operating challenges and increased costs. These challenges could include a lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and delays in skill development. Additionally, higher costs could result from the use of contractors to replace employees, loss of productivity, and safety incidents. Failing to train replacement employees adequately and to transfer internal knowledge and expertise could adversely affect CMS Energy’s and Consumers’ ability to manage and operate their businesses"
2,CMS,CMS ENERGY CORP,2018-02-14,">Item 1A.      Risk Factors
 Actual results in future periods for CMS Energy and Consumers could differ materially from historical results and the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Factors that might cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in the following sections. CMS Energys and Consumers businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, that involve uncertainties that may materially affect results, and that are often beyond their control. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that management believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect CMS Energy or Consumers. The risk factors described in the following sections, as well as the other information included in this report and in other documents filed with the SEC, should be considered carefully before making an investment in securities of CMS Energy or Consumers. Risk factors of Consumers are also risk factors of CMS Energy. All of these risk factors are potentially significant. CMS Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service obligations. Due to its holding company structure, CMS Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other payment obligations. If sufficient dividends were not paid to CMS Energy by its subsidiaries, CMS Energy might not be able to generate the funds necessary to fulfill its payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys liquidity and financial condition. Consumers ability to pay dividends or acquire its own stock from CMS Energy is limited by restrictions contained in Consumers preferred stock provisions and potentially by other legal restrictions, such as certain terms in its articles of incorporation and FERC requirements. 35Table of Contents CMS Energy has indebtedness that could limit its financial flexibility and its ability to meet its debt service obligations. The level of CMS Energys present and future indebtedness could have several important effects on its future operations, including, among others, that: ·                 a significant portion of CMS Energys cash flow from operations could be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness and would not be available for other purposes·                 covenants contained in CMS Energys existing debt arrangements, which require it to meet certain financial tests, could affect its flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in its business·                 CMS Energys ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate and other purposes could become limited·                 CMS Energy could be placed at a competitive disadvantage to its competitors that are less leveraged·                 CMS Energys vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions could increase·                 CMS Energys future credit ratings could fluctuate CMS Energys ability to meet its debt service obligations and to reduce its total indebtedness will depend on its future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, changes in laws or regulatory decisions, and financial, business, and other factors affecting its operations, many of which are beyond its control. CMS Energy cannot make assurances that its businesses will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness. If CMS Energy were unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, it could be required to sell assets or obtain additional financing. CMS Energy and Consumers have financing needs and could be unable to obtain bank financing or access the capital markets. CMS Energy and Consumers may be subject to liquidity demands under commercial commitments, guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, and other contingent liabilities. Consumers capital requirements are expected to be substantial over the next several years as it decommissions older facilities and invests in electric grid modernization technology, construction or acquisition of power generation, environmental controls, conversions and expansions, and other electric and gas infrastructure to upgrade delivery systems. Those requirements may increase if additional laws or regulations are adopted or implemented. CMS Energy and Consumers rely on the capital markets, particularly for publicly offered debt, as well as on bank syndications, to meet their financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs if sufficient internal funds are not available from Consumers operations and, in the case of CMS Energy, from dividends paid by Consumers and its other subsidiaries. CMS Energy and Consumers also use letters of credit issued under certain of their revolving credit facilities to support certain operations and investments. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect CMS Energys and Consumers access to liquidity needed for their businesses. Consumers inability to obtain prior FERC authorization for any securities issuances, including publicly offered debt, as is required under the Federal Power Act, could adversely affect Consumers access to liquidity. Any liquidity disruption could require CMS Energy and Consumers to take measures to conserve cash. These measures could include, but are not limited to, deferring capital expenditures, changing CMS Energys and Consumers commodity purchasing strategy to avoid collateral-posting requirements, and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases, dividend payments, or other discretionary uses of cash. 36Table of Contents CMS Energy continues to explore financing opportunities to supplement its financial strategy. These potential opportunities include refinancing and/or issuing new debt, preferred stock and/or common equity, commercial paper, and bank financing. Similarly, Consumers may seek funds through the capital markets, commercial lenders, and leasing arrangements. Entering into new financings is subject in part to capital market receptivity to utility industry securities in general and to CMS Energys and Consumers securities in particular. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot guarantee the capital markets acceptance of their securities or predict the impact of factors beyond their control, such as actions of rating agencies. Certain of CMS Energys and Consumers securities and those of their affiliates are rated by various credit rating agencies. Any reduction or withdrawal of one or more of its credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on CMS Energys or Consumers ability to access capital on acceptable terms and maintain commodity lines of credit, could increase its cost of borrowing, and could cause CMS Energy or Consumers to reduce capital expenditures. If it were unable to maintain commodity lines of credit, CMS Energy or Consumers might have to post collateral or make prepayments to certain suppliers under existing contracts. Further, since Consumers provides dividends to CMS Energy, any adverse developments affecting Consumers that result in a lowering of its credit ratings could have an adverse effect on CMS Energys credit ratings. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot guarantee that any of their present ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. If CMS Energy or Consumers were unable to obtain bank financing or access the capital markets to incur or refinance indebtedness, or were unable to obtain commercially reasonable terms for any financing, this could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. There are risks associated with Consumers substantial capital investment program planned for the next five years. Consumers planned investments include the construction or acquisition of power generation, electric and gas infrastructure, conversions and expansions, environmental controls, electric grid modernization technology, and other electric and gas investments to upgrade delivery systems, as well as decommissioning of older facilities. The success of these capital investments depends on or could be affected by a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to: ·                 effective pre-acquisition evaluation of asset values, future operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities, and other factors beyond Consumers control·                 effective cost and schedule management of new capital projects·                 availability of qualified construction personnel·                 changes in commodity and other prices·                 governmental approvals and permitting·                 operational performance·                 changes in environmental, legislative, and regulatory requirements·                 regulatory cost recovery It is possible that adverse events associated with these factors could have a material adverse effect on Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes to ROA could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers businesses. The 2016 Energy Law allows electric customers in Consumers service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount capped at ten percent, with certain exceptions, of Consumers weather-adjusted retail sales of the preceding calendar year. Lower natural gas prices due to a large supply of natural gas on the market, coupled with low capacity prices in the electric 37Table of Contents supply market, are placing increasing competitive pressure on the cost of Consumers electric supply. Presently, Consumers electric rates are above the Midwest average, while the ROA level on Consumers system is at the ten-percent limit and the proportion of Consumers electric deliveries under the ROA program and on the ROA waiting list is 24 percent. If the ROA limit were increased or if electric generation service in Michigan were deregulated, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers financial results and operations. CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation, which could have an adverse effect on financial results. CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation. Consumers electric and gas retail rates are set by the MPSC and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization. If rate regulators fail to provide adequate rate relief, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers or Consumers plans for making significant capital investments. Regulators seeking to avoid or minimize rate increases could resist raising customer rates sufficiently to permit Consumers to recover the full cost of these investments. In addition, because there are statutory requirements mandating that regulators allow Consumers to recover from customers certain costs, such as resource additions to meet Michigans renewable resource standard, energy waste reduction, and environmental compliance, regulators could be more inclined to oppose rate increases for other requested items and investments. Rate regulators could also face pressure to avoid or limit rate increases for a number of reasons, including an economic downturn in the state or diminishment of Consumers customer base. Additionally, future orders of the MPSC related to Consumers remeasurement of its deferred income taxes as a result of the TCJA could require accelerated customer refunds. In addition to its potential effects on Consumers investment program, any limitation of cost recovery through rates or any acceleration of customer refunds could have a material adverse effect on Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Orders of the MPSC could limit recovery of costs of providing service including, but not limited to, environmental and safety related expenditures for coal-fueled plants and other utility properties, regulatory assets, power supply and natural gas supply costs, operating and maintenance expenses, additional utility-based investments, sunk investment in mothballed or retired generating plants, costs associated with the proposed retirement and decommissioning of facilities, depreciation expense, MISO energy and transmission costs, costs associated with energy waste reduction investments and state or federally mandated renewable resource standards, or expenditures subject to tracking mechanisms. These orders could also result in adverse regulatory treatment of other matters. For example, MPSC orders could prevent or curtail Consumers from shutting off non-paying customers, could prevent or curtail the implementation of a gas revenue mechanism, or could require Consumers to refund previously self-implemented rates. FERC authorizes certain subsidiaries of CMS Energy to sell electricity at market-based rates. Failure of these subsidiaries to maintain this FERC authority could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Transmission rates are also set by FERC. FERC orders related to transmission costs could have a material adverse effect on Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. The various risks associated with the MPSC and FERC regulation of CMS Energys and Consumers businesses, which include the risk of adverse decisions in any number of rate or regulatory proceedings before either agency, as well as judicial proceedings challenging any agency decisions, could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, investment plans, and results of operations. 38Table of Contents Utility regulation, state or federal legislation, and compliance could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers businesses. CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to, or affected by, extensive utility regulation and state and federal legislation. CMS Energy and Consumers believe that they comply with applicable laws and regulations. If it were determined that they failed to comply, CMS Energy or Consumers could become subject to fines, penalties, or disallowed costs, or be required to implement additional compliance, cleanup, or remediation programs, the cost of which could be material. Adoption of new laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices by federal or state agencies, or challenges or changes to present laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices and the interpretation of any adoption or change, could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, any state or federal legislation concerning CMS Energys or Consumers operations could have a similar effect. Utility regulation could be impacted by various matters, such as electric industry restructuring, hydro relicensing, asset reclassification, gas pipeline capacity and gas storage, new generation facilities or investments, transmission charges, environmental controls, climate change, air emissions, renewable energy, energy policy and ROA, regulation or deregulation, energy capacity standards or markets, reliability, and safety. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the impact of these matters on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. FERC, through NERC, oversees reliability of certain portions of the electric grid. FERC orders regarding electric system reliability could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys or Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Government-mandated power purchases from renewable energy projects may have an adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers businesses. PURPA requires Consumers to purchase power from qualifying cogeneration and small power production facilities at a price approved by the MPSC that is meant to represent Consumers avoided cost of generating power or purchasing power from another source. In November 2017, the MPSC issued an order establishing a new avoided-cost formula to determine the price that Consumers must pay to purchase power under PURPA. Among other things, the MPSCs order changes the basis of Consumers avoided cost from the cost of coal-fueled generating units to that of natural gas-fueled generating units. The MPSC order also assigns more capacity value to qualifying facilities that are consistently able to generate electricity during peak times. The MPSC order could result in mandated purchases of generation, potentially at above-market prices, and reduce Consumers need for new owned generation. This in turn could have a material adverse effect on Consumers capital investment plan, the affordability of future customer rates, and CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, investment plans, and results of operations. CMS Energy and Consumers could incur substantial costs to comply with environmental requirements. CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to costly and stringent environmental regulations that will likely require additional significant capital expenditures for emissions control equipment, CCR disposal and storage, cooling water intake equipment, effluent treatment, and PCB remediation. Present and reasonably anticipated state and federal environmental statutes and regulations, including but not limited to the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, RCRA, CERCLA, and NREPA, will continue to have a material effect on CMS Energy and Consumers. 39Table of Contents CMS Energy and Consumers have interests in fossil-fuel-fired power plants and other types of power plants that produce greenhouse gases. Federal and state environmental laws and rules, as well as international accords and treaties, could require CMS Energy and Consumers to install additional equipment for emission controls, purchase carbon emissions allowances, curtail operations, invest in generating capacity with fewer carbon dioxide emissions, or take other significant steps to manage or lower the emission of greenhouse gases. In 2015, the EPA published final rules pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing electric generating units, calling the rules the Clean Power Plan. The rules, which are being challenged in court, required a 32-percent nationwide reduction in carbon emissions from existing power plants by 2030 (based on 2005 levels). In October 2017, the EPA published a proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan. The EPA has also announced that it intends to begin the rulemaking process for a replacement that conforms to the new legal interpretation set forth in the published proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan. It is expected that the EPA will propose a replacement rule in 2018. The following risks related to climate change, emissions, and environmental regulations could also have a material adverse impact on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations: ·                 litigation originated by third parties against CMS Energy or Consumers due to CMS Energys or Consumers greenhouse gas or other emissions or CCR disposal and storage·                 impairment of CMS Energys or Consumers reputation due to their greenhouse gas or other emissions and public perception of their response to potential environmental regulations, rules, and legislation·                 extreme weather conditions, such as severe storms, that may affect customer demand, company operations, or assets Consumers retired seven smaller coal-fueled electric generating units in 2016. Consumers may encounter previously unknown environmental conditions that will need to be addressed in a timely fashion with state and federal environmental regulators as facilities and equipment on these sites are taken out of service. Consumers expects to collect fully from its customers, through the ratemaking process, expenditures incurred to comply with environmental regulations, but cannot guarantee this outcome. If Consumers were unable to recover these expenditures from customers in rates, it could negatively affect CMS Energys and/or Consumers liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition and CMS Energy and/or Consumers could be required to seek significant additional financing to fund these expenditures. For additional information regarding compliance with environmental regulations, see Item 1. BusinessCMS Energy and Consumers Environmental Strategy and Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOutlookConsumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties. CMS Energys and Consumers businesses could be affected adversely by any delay in meeting environmental requirements. A delay or failure by CMS Energy or Consumers to obtain or maintain any necessary environmental permits or approvals to satisfy any applicable environmental regulatory requirements or install emission control equipment could: ·                 prevent the construction of new facilities·                 prevent the continued operation and sale of energy from existing facilities·                 prevent the suspension of operations at existing facilities 40Table of Contents ·                 prevent the modification of existing facilities·                 result in significant additional costs that could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations CMS Energy and Consumers expect to incur additional substantial costs related to remediation of legacy environmental sites. Consumers expects to incur additional substantial costs related to the remediation of its former MGP sites. Based upon prior MPSC orders, Consumers expects to be able to recover the costs of these cleanup activities through its gas rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome. Consumers also expects to incur remediation and other response activity costs at a number of other sites under NREPA and CERCLA. Consumers believes these costs should be recoverable in rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome. In addition, certain CMS Energy subsidiaries retained environmental remediation obligations for the collection, treatment, and discharge of leachate at Bay Harbor after selling their interests in the development in 2002. Leachate is produced when water enters into cement kiln dust piles left over from former cement plant operations at the site. Certain CMS Energy subsidiaries have signed agreements with the EPA and the MDEQ relating to Bay Harbor. If these CMS Energy subsidiaries were unable to meet their commitments under these agreements, or if unanticipated events occurred, these CMS Energy subsidiaries could incur additional material costs relating to their Bay Harbor remediation obligations. CMS Energy and Consumers could be affected adversely by legacy litigation and retained liabilities. CMS Energy, CMS MST, CMS Field Services, Cantera Natural Gas, Inc., and Cantera Gas Company were named as defendants in various lawsuits arising as a result of alleged inaccurate natural gas price reporting. Remaining allegations include price-fixing conspiracies, restraint of trade, and artificial inflation of natural gas retail prices in Kansas and Wisconsin. CMS Energy cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or the amount of damages for which CMS Energy may be liable. It is possible that the outcome of the lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. The agreements that CMS Energy and Consumers enter into for the sale of assets customarily include provisions whereby they are required to: ·                 retain specified preexisting liabilities, such as for taxes, pensions, or environmental conditions·                 indemnify the buyers against specified risks, including the inaccuracy of representations and warranties that CMS Energy and Consumers make·                 make payments to the buyers depending on the outcome of post-closing adjustments, litigation, audits, or other reviews, including claims resulting from attempts by foreign or domestic governments to assess taxes on past operations or transactions Many of these contingent liabilities can remain open for extended periods of time after the sales are closed. Depending on the extent to which the buyers might ultimately seek to enforce their rights under these contractual provisions, and the resolution of any disputes concerning them, there could be a material adverse effect on CMS Energys or Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. In 2002, CMS Energy sold its oil, gas, and methanol investments in Equatorial Guinea. The government of Equatorial Guinea claims that CMS Energy owes $152 million in taxes, plus significant penalties and interest, in connection with the sale. In 2015, the matter was proceeding to formal arbitration; however, since then the government of Equatorial Guinea has stopped communicating. CMS Energy will continue 41Table of Contents to contest the claim, but cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of the matter. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. CMS Energys and Consumers energy sales and operations are affected by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions from year to year. CMS Energys and Consumers utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment, while peak demand for natural gas occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as heating fuel. In addition, Consumers electric rates, which follow a seasonal rate design, are higher in the summer months than in the remaining months of the year. Accordingly, CMS Energys and Consumers overall results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Mild temperatures during the summer cooling season and winter heating season as well as the impact of extreme weather events on Consumers system could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Consumers is exposed to risks related to general economic conditions in its service territories. Consumers electric and gas utility businesses are affected by the economic conditions impacting the customers they serve. If the Michigan economy becomes sluggish or declines, Consumers could experience reduced demand for electricity or natural gas that could result in decreased earnings and cash flow. In addition, economic conditions in Consumers service territory affect its collections of accounts receivable and levels of lost or stolen gas, which in turn impact its liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to information security risks, risks of unauthorized access to their systems, and technology failures. In the regular course of business, CMS Energy and Consumers handle a range of sensitive security and customer information. CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to laws and rules issued by various agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of this information. A security breach of CMS Energys and Consumers information or control systems could involve theft or the inappropriate release of certain types of information, such as confidential customer information or, separately, system operating information. These events could disrupt operations, subject CMS Energy and Consumers to possible financial liability, damage their reputation and diminish the confidence of customers, and have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial conditions, and results of operations. CMS Energy and Consumers operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information and control technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite implementation of security measures, technology systems, including disaster recovery and backup systems, are vulnerable to failure, cyber crime, unauthorized access, and being disabled. These events could impact the reliability of electric generation and electric and gas delivery and also subject CMS Energy and Consumers to financial harm. Cyber crime, which includes the use of malware, computer viruses, and other means for disruption or unauthorized access against companies, including CMS Energy and Consumers, has increased in frequency, scope, and potential impact in recent years. While CMS Energy and Consumers have not been subject to cyber crime incidents that have had a material impact on their operations to date, their security measures in place may be insufficient to prevent a major cyber incident in the future. If technology systems, including disaster recovery and backup systems, were to fail or be breached, CMS Energy and Consumers might not be able to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive confidential and proprietary data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, because CMS Energys and Consumers generation, transmission, and 42Table of Contents distribution systems are part of an interconnected system, a disruption caused by a cyber incident at another utility, electric generator, system operator, or commodity supplier could also adversely affect CMS Energys or Consumers businesses, financial condition, and results of operations. A variety of technological tools and systems, including both company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties, support critical functions. The failure of these technologies, including backup systems, or the inability of CMS Energy and Consumers to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded, or integrated into other technologies, could hinder their business operations and materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. A breach or failure of technology, including disaster recovery or backup systems, could also have a negative impact on CMS Energys banking subsidiary, EnerBank. CMS Energys and Consumers businesses have liability risks. Consumers electric and gas delivery systems, power plants, gas infrastructure including storage facilities, wind energy or solar equipment, energy products, and the independent power plants owned in whole or in part by CMS Energy could be involved in incidents, failures, or accidents that result in injury, loss of life, or property loss to customers, employees, or the public. Although CMS Energy and Consumers have insurance coverage for many potential incidents (subject to deductibles and self-insurance amounts that could be material), depending upon the nature or severity of any incident, failure, or accident, CMS Energy or Consumers could suffer financial loss, reputational damage, and negative repercussions from regulatory agencies or other public authorities. CMS Energys and Consumers revenues and results of operations are subject to risks that are beyond their control, including but not limited to natural disasters, terrorist attacks and related acts of war, cyber incidents, vandalism, and other catastrophic events. The impact of natural disasters, severe weather, wars, terrorist acts, vandalism, cyber incidents, pandemics, and other catastrophic events on the facilities and operations of CMS Energy and Consumers could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. These events could result in severe damage to CMS Energys and Consumers assets beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies, could require CMS Energy and Consumers to incur significant upfront costs, and could severely disrupt operations, resulting in loss of service to customers. There is also a risk that regulators could, after the fact, conclude that Consumers preparedness or response to such an event was inadequate and take adverse actions as a result. CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to significant reputational risks. CMS Energy and Consumers could suffer negative impacts to their reputations as a result of operational incidents, violations of corporate policies, regulatory violations, inappropriate use of social media, or other events. Reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. It could also result in negative customer perception and increased regulatory oversight. Consumers is exposed to changes in customer usage that could impact financial results. Distributed electricity generation: Technology advances, government incentives and subsidies, and recent regulatory decisions could increase the cost effectiveness of customer-owned methods of producing electricity, such as fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines, and solar photovoltaics, resulting in reduced load, cross subsidization, and increased costs. This could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. 43Table of Contents Energy waste reduction: Customers could reduce their consumption through demand-side energy conservation and energy waste reduction programs. These reductions could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Energy risk management strategies might not be effective in managing fuel and electricity pricing risks, which could result in unanticipated liabilities to CMS Energy and Consumers or increased volatility in their earnings. Consumers is exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas, coal, electric capacity, electric energy, emission allowances, gasoline, diesel fuel, and RECs. Prices for these commodities may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and expose Consumers to price risk. A substantial portion of Consumers operating expenses for its electric generating plants and vehicle fleet consists of the costs of obtaining these commodities. The contracts associated with Consumers fuel and purchased power costs are executed in conjunction with the PSCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover prudently incurred costs associated with those positions. If the MPSC determined that any of these contracts or related contracting policies were imprudent, recovery of these costs could be disallowed. Consumers manages commodity price risk using established policies and procedures, and it may use various contracts to manage this risk, including swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts. No assurance can be made that these strategies will be successful in managing Consumers pricing risk or that they will not result in net liabilities to Consumers as a result of future volatility in these markets. Natural gas prices in particular have been historically volatile. Consumers routinely enters into contracts to mitigate exposure to the risks of demand, market effects of weather, and changes in commodity prices associated with its gas distribution business. These contracts are executed in conjunction with the GCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover prudently incurred costs associated with those positions. If the MPSC determined that any of these contracts or related contracting policies were imprudent, recovery of these costs could be disallowed. Consumers does not always hedge the entire exposure of its operations from commodity price volatility. Furthermore, the ability to hedge exposure to commodity price volatility depends on liquid commodity markets. As a result, to the extent the commodity markets are illiquid, Consumers might not be able to execute its risk management strategies, which could result in larger unhedged positions than preferred at a given time. To the extent that unhedged positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices could have a negative effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes in laws that limit Consumers ability to hedge could also have a negative effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to counterparty risk. Adverse economic conditions or financial difficulties experienced by counterparties with whom CMS Energy and Consumers do business could impair the ability of these counterparties to pay for CMS Energys and Consumers services and/or fulfill their contractual obligations, including performance and payment of damages. CMS Energy and Consumers depend on these counterparties to remit payments and perform contracted services in a timely fashion. Any delay or default in payment or performance of contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Volatility and disruptions in capital and credit markets could have a negative impact on CMS Energys and Consumers lenders, vendors, contractors, suppliers, customers, and other counterparties, causing them to fail to meet their obligations. Adverse economic conditions could also have a negative impact on the loan portfolio of CMS Energys banking subsidiary, EnerBank. 44Table of Contents Consumers might not be able to obtain an adequate supply of natural gas or coal, which could limit its ability to operate its electric generation facilities or serve its natural gas customers. Consumers has natural gas and coal supply and transportation contracts in place for the natural gas and coal it requires for its electric generating capacity. Consumers also has interstate transportation and supply agreements in place to facilitate delivery of natural gas to its customers. Apart from the contractual and monetary remedies available to Consumers in the event of a counterpartys failure to perform under any of these contracts, there can be no assurances that the counterparties to these contracts will fulfill their obligations to provide natural gas or coal to Consumers. The counterparties under the agreements could experience financial or operational problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to Consumers. In addition, counterparties under these contracts might not be required to supply natural gas or coal to Consumers under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster or severe weather. If, for its electric generating capacity, Consumers were unable to obtain its natural gas or coal requirements under existing or future natural gas and coal supply and transportation contracts, or to obtain resources under existing or future PPAs, it could be required to purchase natural gas or coal at higher prices or forced to purchase electricity from higher-cost generating resources in the MISO energy market. If, for natural gas delivery to its customers, Consumers were unable to obtain its natural gas supply requirements under existing or future natural gas supply and transportation contracts, it could be required to purchase natural gas at higher prices from other sources or implement its natural gas curtailment program filed with the MPSC. These alternatives could increase Consumers working capital requirements and could decrease its revenues. Market performance and other changes could decrease the value of employee benefit plan assets, which then could require substantial funding. The performance of the capital markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under CMS Energys and Consumers pension and postretirement benefit plans. CMS Energy and Consumers have significant obligations under these plans and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which could fall below CMS Energys and Consumers forecasted return rates. A decline in the market value of the assets or a change in the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels could significantly increase the funding requirements of these obligations. Also, changes in demographics, including an increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, could significantly increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and postretirement benefit plans. If CMS Energy and Consumers were unable to manage their pension and postretirement plan assets successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. A work interruption or other union actions could adversely affect Consumers. Unions represent 40 percent of Consumers employees. Consumers union agreements expire in 2020. If these employees were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, Consumers could experience a significant disruption in its operations and higher ongoing labor costs. 45Table of Contents Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact CMS Energys and Consumers results of operations. The workforce of CMS Energy and Consumers is aging and a number of employees will become eligible to retire within the next few years. If CMS Energy and Consumers were unable to match skill sets to future needs, they could encounter operating challenges and increased costs. These challenges could include a lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and delays in skill development. Additionally, higher costs could result from the use of contractors to replace employees, loss of productivity, and safety incidents. Failing to train replacement employees adequately and to transfer internal knowledge and expertise could adversely affect CMS Energys and Consumers ability to manage and operate their businesses. If CMS Energy and Consumers were unable to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, their financial condition and results of operations could be affected negatively. Unplanned power plant outages could be costly for Consumers. Unforeseen maintenance of Consumers power plants may be required for many reasons, including catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, extreme weather, floods or other acts of God, failures of equipment or materials, operator error, or the need to comply with environmental or safety regulations. When unplanned maintenance work is required on power plants or other equipment, Consumers will not only incur unexpected maintenance expenses, but it may also have to make spot market purchases of replacement electricity that exceed Consumers costs of generation or be forced to retire a given unit if the cost or timing of the maintenance is not reasonable and prudent. Additionally, unplanned maintenance work could reduce the capacity credit Consumers receives from MISO and could cause Consumers to incur additional capacity costs in future years. If Consumers were unable to recover any of these increased costs in rates, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact CMS Energy and Consumers. CMS Energy and Consumers are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. The tax obligations include income, real estate, sales and use taxes, employment-related taxes, and ongoing issues related to these tax matters. The judgments include determining reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken and may be subject to challenge by the IRS and/or other taxing authorities. Unfavorable settlements of any of the issues related to these reserves or other tax matters at CMS Energy or Consumers could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to changing tax laws. Changes in federal, state, or local tax rates or other changes in tax laws could have adverse impacts on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. In December 2017, President Trump signed the TCJA, which changed existing federal tax law and included numerous provisions that affect businesses. CMS Energy and Consumers have made reasonable estimates in measuring and accounting for the effects of the TCJA, which have been reflected in the December 31, 2017 financial statements. Given expected changes to U.S. Treasury regulations, interpretations of the TCJA by the U.S. Treasury, interpretations of the application of ASC 740, and the companies analysis of their historical records, the final transition impacts of the TCJA may differ from the estimates provided elsewhere in this report. 46Table of Contents CMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers and EnerBank, must comply with the Dodd-Frank Act and its related regulations, which are subject to change and could involve material costs or affect operations. Regulations that are intended to implement the Dodd-Frank Act have been and are still being adopted by the appropriate agencies. The Dodd-Frank Act added a new Section 13 to the Bank Holding Company Act. Known as the Volcker Rule, it generally restricts certain banking entities (such as EnerBank) and their subsidiaries or affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading activities and from owning equity in or sponsoring any private equity or hedge fund. Under the statute, the activities of CMS Energy and its subsidiaries (including EnerBank) are not expected to be materially affected; however, they will be restricted from engaging in proprietary trading, investing in third-party hedge or private equity funds, and sponsoring these funds in the future unless CMS Energy qualifies for an exemption from the rule. CMS Energy and its subsidiaries are also subject to certain ongoing compliance requirements pursuant to the regulations. CMS Energy cannot predict the full impact of the Volcker Rule on CMS Energys or EnerBanks operations or financial condition. All companies that directly or indirectly control an FDIC-insured bank are required to serve as a source of financial strength for that institution. As a result, CMS Energy could be called upon by the FDIC to infuse additional capital into EnerBank to the extent that EnerBank fails to satisfy its capital requirements. In addition, CMS Energy is contractually required (i) to make cash capital contributions to EnerBank in the event that EnerBank does not maintain required minimum capital ratios and (ii) to provide EnerBank financial support, in an amount and duration as may be necessary for EnerBank to meet the cash needs of its depositors and other operations. EnerBank has exceeded these requirements historically and exceeds them as of February 2018. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of certain commodity-related contracts. Although CMS Energy, Consumers, and CMS ERM qualify for an end-user exception from mandatory clearing of commodity-related swaps, these regulations could affect the ability of these entities to participate in these markets and could add additional regulatory oversight over their contracting activities. "
11,CMS,CMS ENERGY CORP,2017-02-07,">Item 1A.      Risk Factors
 Actual results in future periods for CMS Energy and Consumers could differ materially from historical results and the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Factors that might cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in the following sections. CMS Energys and Consumers businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, that involve uncertainties that may materially affect results, and that are often beyond their control. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that management believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect CMS Energy or Consumers. The risk factors described in the following sections, as well as the other information included in this report and in other documents filed with the SEC, should be considered carefully before making an investment in securities of CMS Energy or Consumers. Risk factors of Consumers are also risk factors of CMS Energy. All of these risk factors are potentially significant. CMS Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service obligations. Due to its holding company structure, CMS Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other payment obligations. If sufficient dividends were not paid to CMS Energy by its subsidiaries, CMS Energy might not be able to generate the funds necessary to fulfill its payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys liquidity and financial condition. 31Table of Contents Consumers ability to pay dividends or acquire its own stock from CMS Energy is limited by restrictions contained in Consumers preferred stock provisions and potentially by other legal restrictions, such as certain terms in its articles of incorporation and FERC requirements. CMS Energy has indebtedness that could limit its financial flexibility and its ability to meet its debt service obligations. The level of CMS Energys present and future indebtedness could have several important effects on its future operations, including, among others, that: ·                 a significant portion of CMS Energys cash flow from operations could be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness and would not be available for other purposes·                 covenants contained in CMS Energys existing debt arrangements, which require it to meet certain financial tests, could affect its flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in its business·                 CMS Energys ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate and other purposes could become limited·                 CMS Energy could be placed at a competitive disadvantage to its competitors that are less leveraged·                 CMS Energys vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions could increase·                 CMS Energys future credit ratings could fluctuate CMS Energys ability to meet its debt service obligations and to reduce its total indebtedness will depend on its future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, changes in laws or regulatory decisions, and financial, business, and other factors affecting its operations, many of which are beyond its control. CMS Energy cannot make assurances that its businesses will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness. If CMS Energy were unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, it could be required to sell assets or obtain additional financing. CMS Energy and Consumers have financing needs and could be unable to obtain bank financing or access the capital markets. CMS Energy and Consumers may be subject to liquidity demands under commercial commitments, guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, and other contingent liabilities. Consumers capital requirements are expected to be substantial over the next several years as it invests in the Smart Energy program, construction or acquisition of power generation, environmental controls, decommissioning of older facilities, conversions and expansions, and other electric and gas infrastructure to upgrade delivery systems. Those requirements may increase if additional laws or regulations are adopted or implemented. CMS Energy and Consumers rely on the capital markets, particularly for publicly offered debt, as well as on bank syndications, to meet their financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs if sufficient internal funds are not available from Consumers operations and, in the case of CMS Energy, from dividends paid by Consumers and its other subsidiaries. CMS Energy and Consumers also use letters of credit issued under certain of their revolving credit facilities to support certain operations and investments. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect CMS Energys and Consumers access to liquidity needed for their businesses. Consumers inability to obtain prior FERC authorization for any securities issuances, including publicly offered debt, as is required under the Federal Power Act, could adversely affect Consumers access to liquidity. Any liquidity disruption could require CMS Energy and Consumers to take measures to conserve cash. These measures could include, 32Table of Contents but are not limited to, deferring capital expenditures, changing CMS Energys and Consumers commodity purchasing strategy to avoid collateral-posting requirements, and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases, dividend payments, or other discretionary uses of cash. CMS Energy continues to explore financing opportunities to supplement its financial strategy. These potential opportunities include refinancing and/or issuing new debt, preferred stock and/or common equity, commercial paper, and bank financing. Similarly, Consumers may seek funds through the capital markets, commercial lenders, and leasing arrangements. Entering into new financings is subject in part to capital market receptivity to utility industry securities in general and to CMS Energys and Consumers securities in particular. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot guarantee the capital markets acceptance of their securities or predict the impact of factors beyond their control, such as actions of rating agencies. Certain of CMS Energys and Consumers securities and those of their affiliates are rated by various credit rating agencies. Any reduction or withdrawal of one or more of its credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on CMS Energys or Consumers ability to access capital on acceptable terms and maintain commodity lines of credit, could increase its cost of borrowing, and could cause CMS Energy or Consumers to reduce capital expenditures. If it were unable to maintain commodity lines of credit, CMS Energy or Consumers might have to post collateral or make prepayments to certain suppliers under existing contracts. Further, since Consumers provides dividends to CMS Energy, any adverse developments affecting Consumers that result in a lowering of its credit ratings could have an adverse effect on CMS Energys credit ratings. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot guarantee that any of their present ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. If CMS Energy or Consumers were unable to obtain bank financing or access the capital markets to incur or refinance indebtedness, or were unable to obtain commercially reasonable terms for any financing, this could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. There are risks associated with Consumers substantial capital investment program planned for the next five years. Consumers planned investments include the Smart Energy program, construction or acquisition of power generation, gas and electric infrastructure, conversions and expansions, environmental controls, decommissioning of older facilities, and other electric and gas investments to upgrade delivery systems. The success of these capital investments depends on or could be affected by a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to: ·                 effective pre-acquisition evaluation of asset values, future operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities, and other factors beyond Consumers control·                 effective cost and schedule management of new capital projects·                 availability of qualified construction personnel·                 changes in commodity and other prices·                 governmental approvals and permitting·                 operational performance·                 changes in environmental, legislative, and regulatory requirements·                 regulatory cost recovery It is possible that adverse events associated with these factors could have a material adverse effect on Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. 33Table of Contents Changes to ROA could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers businesses. The 2016 Energy Law allows electric customers in Consumers service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount capped at ten percent, with certain exceptions, of Consumers weather-adjusted retail sales of the preceding calendar year. Lower natural gas prices due to a large supply of natural gas on the market, coupled with low capacity prices in the electric supply market, are placing increasing competitive pressure on the cost of Consumers electric supply. Presently, Consumers electric rates are above the Midwest average, while the ROA level on Consumers system is at the ten-percent limit and the proportion of Consumers electric deliveries under the ROA program and on the ROA waiting list is 24 percent. If the ROA limit were increased or if electric generation service in Michigan were deregulated, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers financial results and operations. CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation, which could have an adverse effect on financial results. CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation. Consumers electric and gas retail rates are set by the MPSC and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization. Consumers is presently permitted to self-implement rate changes six months after a rate filing with the MPSC, although the MPSC may delay, deny, or limit self-implementation upon a showing of good cause. If Consumers self-implements rates that result in higher revenues than would have resulted from rates that the MPSC authorizes in its final order, Consumers must refund the difference, with interest. The 2016 Energy Law, which will become effective in April 2017, removes the right to self-implementation for rate cases filed after the effective date and sets a ten-month schedule for a final decision in a general rate case. In addition, if rate regulators fail to provide timely rate relief, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers or Consumers plans for making significant capital investments could be materially adversely affected. Regulators seeking to avoid or minimize rate increases could resist raising customer rates sufficiently to permit Consumers to recover the full cost of these investments. In addition, because there are statutory requirements mandating that regulators allow Consumers to recover from customers certain costs, such as resource additions to meet Michigans renewable resource standard, energy optimization, and environmental compliance, regulators could be more inclined to oppose rate increases for other requested items and investments. Rate regulators could also face pressure to avoid or limit rate increases for a number of reasons, including an economic downturn in the state or diminishment of Consumers customer base. In addition to its potential effects on Consumers investment program, any limitation of cost recovery through rates could have a material adverse effect on Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Orders of the MPSC could limit recovery of costs of providing service including, but not limited to, environmental and safety related expenditures for coal-fueled plants and other utility properties, regulatory assets, power supply and natural gas supply costs, operating and maintenance expenses, additional utility-based investments, sunk investment in mothballed or retired generating plants, costs associated with the proposed retirement and decommissioning of facilities, depreciation expense, MISO energy and transmission costs, costs associated with energy waste reduction investments and state or federally mandated renewable resource standards, Smart Energy program costs, or expenditures subject to tracking mechanisms. These orders could also result in adverse regulatory treatment of other matters. For example, MPSC orders could prevent or curtail Consumers from shutting off non-paying customers, could prevent or curtail Consumers from self-implementing rate changes, could prevent or curtail the implementation of a gas revenue mechanism, or could require Consumers to refund previously self-implemented rates. FERC authorizes certain subsidiaries of CMS Energy to sell electricity at market-based rates. Failure of these subsidiaries to maintain this FERC authority could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys 34Table of Contents and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Transmission rates are also set by FERC. FERC orders related to transmission costs could have a material adverse effect on Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. The various risks associated with the MPSC and FERC regulation of CMS Energys and Consumers businesses, which include the risk of adverse decisions in any number of rate or regulatory proceedings before either agency, as well as judicial proceedings challenging any agency decisions, could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, investment plans, and results of operations. Utility regulation, state or federal legislation, and compliance could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers businesses. CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to, or affected by, extensive utility regulation and state and federal legislation. CMS Energy and Consumers believe that they comply with applicable laws and regulations. If it were determined that they failed to comply, CMS Energy or Consumers could become subject to fines, penalties, or disallowed costs, or be required to implement additional compliance, cleanup, or remediation programs, the cost of which could be material. Adoption of new laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices by federal or state agencies, or challenges or changes to present laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices and the interpretation of any adoption or change, could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, any state or federal legislation concerning CMS Energys or Consumers operations could have a similar effect. Utility regulation could be impacted by various matters, such as electric industry restructuring, hydro relicensing, asset reclassification, gas pipeline capacity and gas storage, new generation facilities or investments, environmental controls, climate change, air emissions, renewable energy, energy policy and ROA, regulation or deregulation, energy capacity standards or markets, reliability, and safety. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the impact of these matters on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. FERC, through NERC, oversees reliability of certain portions of the electric facilities owned by CMS Energy and Consumers. FERC orders regarding electric system reliability could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys or Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. CMS Energy and Consumers could incur substantial costs to comply with environmental requirements. CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to costly and stringent environmental regulations that will likely require additional significant capital expenditures for emissions control equipment, CCR disposal and storage, cooling water intake equipment, effluent treatment, and PCB remediation. Present and reasonably anticipated state and federal environmental statutes and regulations, including but not limited to the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, RCRA, and CERCLA, will continue to have a material effect on CMS Energy and Consumers. CMS Energy and Consumers have interests in fossil-fuel-fired power plants and other types of power plants that produce greenhouse gases. Federal and state environmental laws and rules, as well as international accords and treaties, could require CMS Energy and Consumers to install additional equipment for emission controls, purchase carbon emissions allowances, curtail operations, invest in generating capacity with fewer carbon dioxide emissions, or take other significant steps to manage or lower the emission of greenhouse gases. In October 2015, the EPA published rules pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing electric generating units, calling the rules the Clean Power Plan. The rules, which are being challenged in court, require a 35Table of Contents 32 percent nationwide reduction in carbon emissions from existing power plants by 2030 (based on 2005 levels). The Trump administration has also indicated that it intends to re-examine the Clean Power Plan. The following risks related to climate change, emissions, and environmental regulations could also have a material adverse impact on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations: ·                 litigation originated by third parties against CMS Energy or Consumers due to CMS Energys or Consumers greenhouse gas or other emissions or CCR disposal and storage·                 impairment of CMS Energys or Consumers reputation due to their greenhouse gas or other emissions and public perception of their response to potential environmental regulations, rules, and legislation·                 extreme weather conditions, such as severe storms, that may affect customer demand, company operations, or assets Consumers retired seven smaller coal-fueled electric generating units in 2016. Consumers may encounter previously unknown environmental conditions that will need to be addressed in a timely fashion with state and federal environmental regulators as facilities and equipment on these sites are taken out of service. Consumers expects to collect fully from its customers, through the ratemaking process, expenditures incurred to comply with environmental regulations, but cannot guarantee this outcome. If Consumers were unable to recover these expenditures from customers in rates, it could negatively affect CMS Energys and/or Consumers liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition and CMS Energy and/or Consumers could be required to seek significant additional financing to fund these expenditures. For additional information regarding compliance with environmental regulations, see Item 1. BusinessCMS Energy and Consumers Environmental Compliance and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataMD&AOutlookConsumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties. CMS Energys and Consumers businesses could be affected adversely by any delay in meeting environmental requirements. A delay or failure by CMS Energy or Consumers to obtain or maintain any necessary environmental permits or approvals to satisfy any applicable environmental regulatory requirements or install emission control equipment could: ·                 prevent the construction of new facilities·                 prevent the continued operation and sale of energy from existing facilities·                 prevent the suspension of operations at existing facilities·                 prevent the modification of existing facilities·                 result in significant additional costs that could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations CMS Energy and Consumers expect to incur additional substantial costs related to remediation of legacy environmental sites. Consumers expects to incur additional substantial costs related to the remediation of its former MGP sites. Based upon prior MPSC orders, Consumers expects to be able to recover the costs of these cleanup activities through its gas rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome. 36Table of Contents Consumers also expects to incur remediation and other response activity costs at a number of other sites under NREPA and CERCLA. Consumers believes these costs should be recoverable in rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome. In addition, certain CMS Energy subsidiaries retained environmental remediation obligations for the collection, treatment, and discharge of leachate at Bay Harbor after selling their interests in the development in 2002. Leachate is produced when water enters into cement kiln dust piles left over from former cement plant operations at the site. Certain CMS Energy subsidiaries have signed agreements with the EPA and the MDEQ relating to Bay Harbor. If these CMS Energy subsidiaries were unable to meet their commitments under these agreements, or if unanticipated events occurred, these CMS Energy subsidiaries could incur additional material costs relating to their Bay Harbor remediation obligations. CMS Energy and Consumers could be affected adversely by legacy litigation and retained liabilities. CMS Energy, CMS MST, CMS Field Services, Cantera Natural Gas, Inc., and Cantera Gas Company were named as defendants in various lawsuits arising as a result of alleged inaccurate natural gas price reporting. Allegations include price-fixing conspiracies, restraint of trade, and artificial inflation of natural gas retail prices in Kansas, Missouri, and Wisconsin. CMS Energy cannot predict the outcome of the lawsuits or the amount of damages for which CMS Energy may be liable. It is possible that the outcome in one or more of the lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. The agreements that CMS Energy and Consumers enter into for the sale of assets customarily include provisions whereby they are required to: ·                 retain specified preexisting liabilities, such as for taxes, pensions, or environmental conditions·                 indemnify the buyers against specified risks, including the inaccuracy of representations and warranties that CMS Energy and Consumers make·                 make payments to the buyers depending on the outcome of post-closing adjustments, litigation, audits, or other reviews, including claims resulting from attempts by foreign or domestic governments to assess taxes on past operations or transactions Many of these contingent liabilities can remain open for extended periods of time after the sales are closed. Depending on the extent to which the buyers might ultimately seek to enforce their rights under these contractual provisions, and the resolution of any disputes concerning them, there could be a material adverse effect on CMS Energys or Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. In 2002, CMS Energy sold its oil, gas, and methanol investments in Equatorial Guinea. The government of Equatorial Guinea claims that CMS Energy owes $152 million in taxes, plus significant penalties and interest, in connection with the sale. The matter is proceeding to formal arbitration. CMS Energy is contesting the claim, but cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of the matter. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. CMS Energys and Consumers energy sales and operations are affected by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions from year to year. CMS Energys and Consumers utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment, while peak demand for natural gas occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as heating fuel. In addition, Consumers electric rates, which follow a seasonal rate design, are higher in the summer months than in the remaining months of the year. Accordingly, CMS Energys and Consumers overall results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Mild 37Table of Contents temperatures during the summer cooling season and winter heating season as well as the impact of extreme weather events on Consumers system could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Consumers is exposed to risks related to general economic conditions in its service territories. Consumers electric and gas utility businesses are affected by the economic conditions impacting the customers they serve. If the Michigan economy becomes sluggish or declines, Consumers could experience reduced demand for electricity or natural gas that could result in decreased earnings and cash flow. In addition, economic conditions in Consumers service territory affect its collections of accounts receivable and levels of lost or stolen gas, which in turn impact its liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to information security risks, risks of unauthorized access to their systems, and technology failures. In the regular course of business, CMS Energy and Consumers handle a range of sensitive security and customer information. CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to laws and rules issued by various agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of this information. A security breach of CMS Energys and Consumers information or control systems could involve theft or the inappropriate release of certain types of information, such as confidential customer information or, separately, system operating information. These events could disrupt operations, subject CMS Energy and Consumers to possible financial liability, damage their reputation and diminish the confidence of customers, and have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial conditions, and results of operations. CMS Energy and Consumers operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information and control technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite implementation of security measures, technology systems are vulnerable to being disabled, failures, cyber crime, and unauthorized access. These events could impact the reliability of electric generation and electric and gas delivery and also subject CMS Energy and Consumers to financial harm. Cyber crime, which includes the use of malware, computer viruses, and other means for disruption or unauthorized access against companies, including CMS Energy and Consumers, has increased in frequency, scope, and potential impact in recent years. While CMS Energy and Consumers have not been subject to cyber crime incidents that have had a material impact on their operations to date, their security measures in place may be insufficient to prevent a major cyber incident in the future. If technology systems were to fail or be breached, CMS Energy and Consumers might not be able to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive confidential and proprietary data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, because CMS Energys and Consumers generation, transmission, and distribution systems are part of an interconnected system, a disruption caused by a cyber incident at another utility, electric generator, system operator, or commodity supplier could also adversely affect CMS Energys or Consumers businesses, financial condition, and results of operations. A variety of technological tools and systems, including both company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties, support critical functions. The failure of these technologies, or the inability of CMS Energy and Consumers to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded, or integrated into other technologies, could hinder their business operations and materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. CMS Energys and Consumers businesses have liability risks. Consumers electric and gas delivery systems, power plants, gas infrastructure including storage facilities, wind energy or solar equipment, energy products, and the independent power plants owned in whole or in 38Table of Contents part by CMS Energy could be involved in incidents, failures, or accidents that result in injury, loss of life, or property loss to customers, employees, or the public. Although CMS Energy and Consumers have insurance coverage for many potential incidents (subject to deductibles and self-insurance amounts that could be material), depending upon the nature or severity of any incident, failure, or accident, CMS Energy or Consumers could suffer financial loss, reputational damage, and negative repercussions from regulatory agencies or other public authorities. CMS Energys and Consumers revenues and results of operations are subject to risks that are beyond their control, including but not limited to natural disasters, terrorist attacks and related acts of war, cyber incidents, vandalism, and other catastrophic events. The impact of natural disasters, severe weather, wars, terrorist acts, vandalism, cyber incidents, pandemics, and other catastrophic events on the facilities and operations of CMS Energy and Consumers could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. These events could result in severe damage to CMS Energys and Consumers assets beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies, could require CMS Energy and Consumers to incur significant upfront costs, and could severely disrupt operations, resulting in loss of service to customers. There is also a risk that regulators could, after the fact, conclude that Consumers preparedness or response to such an event was inadequate and take adverse actions as a result. CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to significant reputational risks. CMS Energy and Consumers could suffer negative impacts to their reputations as a result of operational incidents, violations of corporate policies, regulatory violations, inappropriate use of social media, or other events. Reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. It could also result in negative customer perception and increased regulatory oversight. Consumers is exposed to changes in customer usage that could impact financial results. Distributed electricity generation: Technology advances and government incentives and subsidies could increase the cost effectiveness of customer-owned methods of producing electricity, such as fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines, and solar photovoltaics, resulting in reduced load, cross subsidization, and increased costs. This could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Energy waste reduction: Customers could reduce their consumption through demand-side energy conservation and energy waste reduction programs. These reductions could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Energy risk management strategies might not be effective in managing fuel and electricity pricing risks, which could result in unanticipated liabilities to CMS Energy and Consumers or increased volatility in their earnings. Consumers is exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas, coal, electric capacity, electric energy, emission allowances, gasoline, diesel fuel, and RECs. Prices for these commodities may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and expose Consumers to price risk. A substantial portion of Consumers operating expenses for its electric generating plants and vehicle fleet consists of the costs of obtaining these commodities. The contracts associated with Consumers fuel and purchased power costs are executed in conjunction with the PSCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover prudently incurred costs associated with those positions. If the MPSC determined that any of these contracts or related contracting policies were imprudent, recovery of these costs could be disallowed. Consumers manages commodity price risk using established policies and procedures, and it may use various contracts to manage this risk, including swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts. 39Table of Contents No assurance can be made that these strategies will be successful in managing Consumers pricing risk or that they will not result in net liabilities to Consumers as a result of future volatility in these markets. Natural gas prices in particular have been historically volatile. Consumers routinely enters into contracts to mitigate exposure to the risks of demand, market effects of weather, and changes in commodity prices associated with its gas distribution business. These contracts are executed in conjunction with the GCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover prudently incurred costs associated with those positions. If the MPSC determined that any of these contracts or related contracting policies were imprudent, recovery of these costs could be disallowed. Consumers does not always hedge the entire exposure of its operations from commodity price volatility. Furthermore, the ability to hedge exposure to commodity price volatility depends on liquid commodity markets. As a result, to the extent the commodity markets are illiquid, Consumers might not be able to execute its risk management strategies, which could result in larger unhedged positions than preferred at a given time. To the extent that unhedged positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices could have a negative effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes in laws that limit Consumers ability to hedge could also have a negative effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to counterparty risk. Adverse economic conditions or financial difficulties experienced by counterparties with whom CMS Energy and Consumers do business could impair the ability of these counterparties to pay for CMS Energys and Consumers services and/or fulfill their contractual obligations, including performance and payment of damages. CMS Energy and Consumers depend on these counterparties to remit payments and perform contracted services in a timely fashion. Any delay or default in payment or performance of contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Volatility and disruptions in capital and credit markets could have a negative impact on CMS Energys and Consumers lenders, vendors, contractors, suppliers, customers, and other counterparties, causing them to fail to meet their obligations. Adverse economic conditions could also have a negative impact on the loan portfolio of CMS Energys banking subsidiary, EnerBank. Consumers might not be able to obtain an adequate supply of natural gas or coal, which could limit its ability to operate its electric generation facilities or serve its natural gas customers. Consumers has natural gas and coal supply and transportation contracts in place for the natural gas and coal it requires for its electric generating capacity. Consumers also has interstate transportation and supply agreements in place to facilitate delivery of natural gas to its customers. Apart from the contractual and monetary remedies available to Consumers in the event of a counterpartys failure to perform under any of these contracts, there can be no assurances that the counterparties to these contracts will fulfill their obligations to provide natural gas or coal to Consumers. The counterparties under the agreements could experience financial or operational problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to Consumers. In addition, counterparties under these contracts might not be required to supply natural gas or coal to Consumers under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster or severe weather. If, for its electric generating capacity, Consumers were unable to obtain its natural gas or coal requirements under existing or future natural gas and coal supply and transportation contracts, or to obtain resources under existing or future PPAs, it could be required to purchase natural gas or coal at higher prices or forced to purchase electricity from higher-cost generating resources in the MISO energy market. If, for natural gas delivery to its customers, Consumers were unable to obtain its natural gas supply requirements under existing or future natural gas supply and transportation contracts, it could be required to purchase natural gas at higher prices from other sources or implement its natural gas curtailment 40Table of Contents program filed with the MPSC. These alternatives could increase Consumers working capital requirements and could decrease its revenues. Market performance and other changes could decrease the value of employee benefit plan assets, which then could require substantial funding. The performance of the capital markets affects the values of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under CMS Energys and Consumers pension and postretirement benefit plans. CMS Energy and Consumers have significant obligations under these plans and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which could fall below CMS Energys and Consumers forecasted return rates. A decline in the market value of the assets or a change in the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels could significantly increase the funding requirements of these obligations. Also, changes in demographics, including an increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, could significantly increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and postretirement benefit plans. If CMS Energy and Consumers were unable to manage their pension and postretirement plan assets successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. A work interruption or other union actions could adversely affect Consumers. Over 40 percent of Consumers employees are represented by unions. In 2015, both of Consumers unions, representing all union employees, ratified three separate five-year agreements, expiring in 2020. If these employees were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, Consumers could experience a significant disruption in its operations and higher ongoing labor costs. Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact CMS Energys and Consumers results of operations. The workforce of CMS Energy and Consumers is aging and a number of employees will become eligible to retire within the next few years. If CMS Energy and Consumers were unable to match skill sets to future needs, they could encounter operating challenges and increased costs. These challenges could include a lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and delays in skill development. Additionally, higher costs could result from the use of contractors to replace employees, loss of productivity, and safety incidents. Failing to train replacement employees adequately and to transfer internal knowledge and expertise could adversely affect CMS Energys and Consumers ability to manage and operate their businesses. If CMS Energy and Consumers were unable to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, their financial condition and results of operations could be affected negatively. Unplanned power plant outages could be costly for Consumers. Unforeseen maintenance of Consumers power plants may be required for many reasons, including catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, extreme weather, floods or other acts of God, failures of equipment or materials, operator error, or the need to comply with environmental or safety regulations. When unplanned maintenance work is required on power plants or other equipment, Consumers will not only incur unexpected maintenance expenses, but it may also have to make spot market purchases of replacement electricity that exceed Consumers costs of generation or be forced to retire a given unit if the cost or timing of the maintenance is not reasonable and prudent. Additionally, unplanned maintenance work could reduce the capacity credit Consumers receives from MISO and could cause Consumers to incur additional capacity costs in future years. If Consumers were unable to recover any of these increased costs in rates, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. 41Table of Contents Changes in taxation, including potential federal tax reform, as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact CMS Energy and Consumers. CMS Energy and Consumers are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. The tax obligations include income, real estate, sales and use taxes, employment-related taxes, and ongoing issues related to these tax matters. The judgments include determining reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken and may be subject to challenge by the IRS and/or other taxing authorities. Unfavorable settlements of any of the issues related to these reserves or other tax matters at CMS Energy or Consumers could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to changing tax laws. Changes in federal, state, or local tax rates or other changes in tax laws could have adverse impacts on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. CMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers and EnerBank, must comply with the Dodd-Frank Act and its related regulations, which are subject to change and could involve material costs or affect operations. Regulations that are intended to implement the Dodd-Frank Act have been and are still being adopted by the appropriate agencies. The Dodd-Frank Act added a new Section 13 to the Bank Holding Company Act. Known as the Volcker Rule, it generally restricts certain banking entities (such as EnerBank) and their subsidiaries or affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading activities and from owning equity in or sponsoring any private equity or hedge fund. Under the statute, the activities of CMS Energy and its subsidiaries (including EnerBank) are not expected to be materially affected; however, they will be restricted from engaging in proprietary trading, investing in third-party hedge or private equity funds, and sponsoring these funds in the future unless CMS Energy qualifies for an exemption from the rule. CMS Energy and its subsidiaries are also subject to certain ongoing compliance requirements pursuant to the regulations. CMS Energy cannot predict the full impact of the Volcker Rule on CMS Energys or EnerBanks operations or financial condition. Effective July 2011, all companies that directly or indirectly control an FDIC-insured bank are required to serve as a source of financial strength for that institution. As a result, CMS Energy could be called upon by the FDIC to infuse additional capital into EnerBank to the extent that EnerBank fails to satisfy its capital requirements. In addition, CMS Energy is contractually required (i) to make cash capital contributions to EnerBank in the event that EnerBank does not maintain required minimum capital ratios and (ii) to provide EnerBank financial support, in an amount and duration as may be necessary for EnerBank to meet the cash needs of its depositors and other operations. EnerBank has exceeded these requirements historically and exceeds them as of February 2017. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of certain commodity-related contracts. Although CMS Energy, Consumers, and CMS ERM qualify for an end-user exception from mandatory clearing of commodity-related swaps, these regulations could affect the ability of these entities to participate in these markets and could add additional regulatory oversight over their contracting activities. 42Table of Contents "
4,CMS,CMS ENERGY CORP,2016-02-11,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
 Actual results in future periods for CMS Energy and Consumers could differ materially from historical results and the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Factors that might cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the following sections. CMS Energys and Consumers businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, that involve uncertainties that may materially affect results, and that are often beyond their control. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that management believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect CMS Energy or Consumers. The risk factors described in the following sections, as well as the other information included in this report and in other documents filed with the SEC, should be considered carefully before making an investment in securities of CMS Energy or Consumers. Risk factors of Consumers are also risk factors of CMS Energy. All of these risk factors are potentially significant. CMS Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service obligations. Due to its holding company structure, CMS Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other payment obligations. If sufficient dividends were not paid to CMS Energy by its subsidiaries, CMS Energy might not be able to generate the funds necessary to fulfill its payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys liquidity and financial condition. Consumers ability to pay dividends or acquire its own stock from CMS Energy is limited by restrictions contained in Consumers preferred stock provisions and potentially by other legal restrictions, such as certain terms in its articles of incorporation and FERC requirements. 30Table of Contents CMS Energy has indebtedness that could limit its financial flexibility and its ability to meet its debt service obligations. The level of CMS Energys present and future indebtedness could have several important effects on its future operations, including, among others, that: ·                 a significant portion of CMS Energys cash flow from operations could be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness and would not be available for other purposes·                 covenants contained in CMS Energys existing debt arrangements, which require it to meet certain financial tests, could affect its flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in its business·                 CMS Energys ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate and other purposes could become limited·                 CMS Energy could be placed at a competitive disadvantage to its competitors that are less leveraged·                 CMS Energys vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions could increase·                 CMS Energys future credit ratings could fluctuate CMS Energys ability to meet its debt service obligations and to reduce its total indebtedness will depend on its future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, changes in laws or regulatory decisions, and financial, business, and other factors affecting its operations, many of which are beyond its control. CMS Energy cannot make assurances that its businesses will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness. If CMS Energy were unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, it could be required to sell assets or obtain additional financing. CMS Energy and Consumers have financing needs and could be unable to obtain bank financing or access the capital markets. CMS Energy and Consumers may be subject to liquidity demands under commercial commitments, guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, and other contingent liabilities. Consumers capital requirements are expected to be substantial over the next several years as it invests in the Smart Energy program, construction or acquisition of power generation, environmental controls, decommissioning of older facilities, conversions and expansions, and other electric and gas infrastructure to upgrade delivery systems. Those requirements may increase if additional laws or regulations are adopted or implemented. CMS Energy and Consumers rely on the capital markets, particularly for publicly offered debt, as well as on bank syndications, to meet their financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs if sufficient internal funds are not available from Consumers operations and, in the case of CMS Energy, from dividends paid by Consumers and its other subsidiaries. CMS Energy and Consumers also use letters of credit issued under certain of their revolving credit facilities to support certain operations and investments. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect CMS Energys and Consumers access to liquidity needed for their businesses. Consumers inability to obtain prior FERC authorization for any securities issuances, including publicly offered debt, as is required under the Federal Power Act, could adversely affect Consumers access to liquidity. Any liquidity disruption could require CMS Energy and Consumers to take measures to conserve cash. These measures could include, but are not limited to, deferring capital expenditures, changing CMS Energys and Consumers commodity purchasing strategy to avoid collateral-posting requirements, and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases, dividend payments, or other discretionary uses of cash. 31Table of Contents CMS Energy continues to explore financing opportunities to supplement its financial strategy. These potential opportunities include refinancing and/or issuing new debt, preferred stock and/or common equity, commercial paper, and bank financing. Similarly, Consumers may seek funds through the capital markets, commercial lenders, and leasing arrangements. Entering into new financings is subject in part to capital market receptivity to utility industry securities in general and to CMS Energys and Consumers securities in particular. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot guarantee the capital markets acceptance of their securities or predict the impact of factors beyond their control, such as actions of rating agencies. Certain of CMS Energys and Consumers securities and those of their affiliates are rated by various credit rating agencies. Any reduction or withdrawal of one or more of its credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on CMS Energys or Consumers ability to access capital on acceptable terms and maintain commodity lines of credit, could increase its cost of borrowing, and could cause CMS Energy or Consumers to reduce capital expenditures. If it were unable to maintain commodity lines of credit, CMS Energy or Consumers might have to post collateral or make prepayments to certain suppliers under existing contracts. Further, since Consumers provides dividends to CMS Energy, any adverse developments affecting Consumers that result in a lowering of its credit ratings could have an adverse effect on CMS Energys credit ratings. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot guarantee that any of their present ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. If CMS Energy or Consumers were unable to obtain bank financing or access the capital markets to incur or refinance indebtedness, or were unable to obtain commercially reasonable terms for any financing, this could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. There are risks associated with Consumers substantial capital investment program planned for the next five years. Consumers planned investments include the Smart Energy program, construction or acquisition of power generation, gas infrastructure, conversions and expansions, environmental controls, decommissioning of older facilities, and other electric and gas investments to upgrade delivery systems. The success of these capital investments depends on or could be affected by a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to: ·                 effective pre-acquisition evaluation of asset values, future operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities, and other factors beyond Consumers control·                 effective cost and schedule management of new capital projects·                 availability of qualified construction personnel·                 changes in commodity and other prices·                 governmental approvals and permitting·                 operational performance·                 changes in environmental, legislative, and regulatory requirements·                 regulatory cost recovery It is possible that adverse events associated with these factors could have a material adverse effect on Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes to ROA could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers businesses. The 2008 Energy Law allows electric customers in Consumers service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount up to ten percent of Consumers weather-adjusted retail sales of the preceding calendar year. Lower natural gas prices due to a large supply of natural gas on the market, coupled with low capacity prices in the electric supply market, are 32Table of Contents placing increasing competitive pressure on the cost of Consumers electric supply. Presently, Consumers electric rates are above the Midwest average, while the ROA level on Consumers system is at the ten-percent limit and the proportion of Consumers electric deliveries under the ROA program and on the ROA waiting list is 25 percent. If the ROA limit were increased or if electric generation service in Michigan were deregulated, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers financial results and operations. CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation, which could have an adverse effect on financial results. CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation. Consumers electric and gas retail rates are set by the MPSC and cannot be increased without regulatory authorization. Consumers is permitted by the 2008 Energy Law to self-implement rate changes six months after a rate filing with the MPSC, subject to certain limitations. If Consumers self-implements rates that result in higher revenues than would have resulted from rates that the MPSC authorizes in its final order, Consumers must refund the difference, with interest. Also, the MPSC may delay or deny implementation of a rate increase upon showing of good cause. In addition, if rate regulators fail to provide timely rate relief, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers or Consumers plans for making significant capital investments could be materially adversely affected. Regulators seeking to avoid or minimize rate increases could resist raising customer rates sufficiently to permit Consumers to recover the full cost of these investments. In addition, because there are statutory requirements mandating that regulators must allow Consumers to recover from customers certain costs, such as resource additions to meet Michigans renewable resource standard, energy optimization, and environmental compliance, regulators could be more inclined to oppose rate increases for other requested items and investments. Rate regulators could also face pressure to avoid or limit rate increases for a number of reasons, including an economic downturn in the state or diminishment of Consumers customer base. In addition to its potential effects on Consumers investment program, any limitation of cost recovery through rates could have a material adverse effect on Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Orders of the MPSC could limit recovery of costs of providing service including, but not limited to, environmental and safety related expenditures for coal-fueled plants and other utility properties, regulatory assets, power supply and natural gas supply costs, operating and maintenance expenses, additional utility-based investments, sunk investment in mothballed or retired generating plants, costs associated with the proposed retirement and decommissioning of facilities, depreciation expense, MISO energy and transmission costs, costs associated with energy efficiency investments and state or federally mandated renewable resource standards, Smart Energy program costs, or expenditures subject to tracking mechanisms. These orders could also result in adverse regulatory treatment of other matters. For example, MPSC orders could prevent or curtail Consumers from shutting off non-paying customers, could prevent or curtail Consumers from self-implementing rate changes, could prevent or curtail the implementation of a gas revenue mechanism, or could require Consumers to refund previously self-implemented rates. FERC authorizes certain subsidiaries of CMS Energy to sell electricity at market-based rates. Failure of these subsidiaries to maintain this FERC authority could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Transmission rates are also set by FERC. FERC orders related to transmission costs could have a material adverse effect on Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. The various risks associated with the MPSC and FERC regulation of CMS Energys and Consumers businesses, which include the risk of adverse decisions in any number of rate or regulatory proceedings before either agency, as well as judicial proceedings challenging any agency decisions, could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, investment plans, and results of operations. 33Table of Contents Utility regulation, state or federal legislation, and compliance could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers businesses. CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to, or affected by, extensive utility regulation and state and federal legislation. CMS Energy and Consumers believe that they comply with applicable laws and regulations. If it were determined that they failed to comply, CMS Energy or Consumers could become subject to fines or penalties or be required to implement additional compliance, cleanup, and remediation programs, the cost of which could be material. Adoption of new laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices by federal or state agencies, or changes to present laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices and the interpretation of any adoption or change, could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, any state or federal legislation concerning CMS Energys or Consumers operations could have a similar effect. Utility regulation could be impacted by various matters, such as electric industry restructuring, hydro relicensing, asset reclassification, gas pipeline capacity and gas storage, new generation facilities or investments, environmental controls, climate change, air emissions, renewable energy, energy policy and ROA, regulation or deregulation, energy capacity standards or markets, reliability, and safety. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the impact of these matters on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. CMS Energy and Consumers could incur substantial costs to comply with environmental requirements. CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to costly and stringent environmental regulations and expect that environmental laws and regulations will continue to become more stringent and require additional significant capital expenditures for emissions control equipment, CCR disposal and storage, cooling water intake equipment, effluent treatment, and PCB remediation. Present and reasonably anticipated state and federal environmental statutes and regulations, including but not limited to the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and CERCLA, will continue to have a material effect on CMS Energy and Consumers. In 2015, 95 percent of the energy generated by Consumers came from fossil-fuel-fired power plants, with 77 percent coming from coal-fueled power plants. CMS Enterprises also has interests in fossil-fuel-fired power plants and other types of power plants that produce greenhouse gases. In October 2015, the EPA published rules pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing electric generating units, calling the rules the Clean Power Plan. The rules require a 32 percent nationwide reduction in carbon emissions from existing power plants by 2030 (based on 2005 levels). Federal environmental laws and rules and international accords and treaties could require CMS Energy and Consumers to install additional equipment for emission controls, purchase carbon emissions allowances, curtail operations, invest in generating capacity with fewer carbon dioxide emissions, or take other significant steps to manage or lower the emission of greenhouse gases. The following risks related to climate change, emissions, and environmental regulations could also have a material adverse impact on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations: ·                 litigation originated by third parties against CMS Energy, Consumers, or their subsidiaries due to CMS Energys or Consumers greenhouse gas or other emissions or CCR disposal and storage·                 impairment of CMS Energys or Consumers reputation due to their greenhouse gas or other emissions and public perception of their response to potential environmental regulations, rules, and legislation·                 extreme weather conditions, such as severe storms, that may affect customer demand, company operations, or assets 34Table of Contents Consumers plans to retire seven smaller coal-fueled electric generating units by April 2016. Once the facilities and equipment on these sites are taken out of service, Consumers may encounter previously unknown environmental conditions that will need to be addressed in a timely fashion with state and federal environmental regulators. Consumers expects to collect fully from its customers, through the ratemaking process, expenditures incurred to comply with environmental regulations, but cannot guarantee this outcome. If Consumers were unable to recover these expenditures from customers in rates, it could negatively affect CMS Energys and/or Consumers liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition and CMS Energy and/or Consumers could be required to seek significant additional financing to fund these expenditures. For additional information regarding compliance with environmental regulations, see Item 1. BusinessCMS Energy and Consumers Environmental Compliance and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataMD&AOutlookConsumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties. CMS Energys and Consumers businesses could be affected adversely by any delay in meeting environmental requirements. A delay or failure by CMS Energy or Consumers to obtain or maintain any necessary environmental permits or approvals to satisfy any applicable environmental regulatory requirements or install emission control equipment could: ·                 prevent the construction of new facilities·                 prevent the continued operation and sale of energy from existing facilities·                 prevent the suspension of operations at existing facilities·                 prevent the modification of existing facilities·                 result in significant additional costs that could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations CMS Energy and Consumers expect to incur additional substantial costs related to remediation of legacy environmental sites. Consumers expects to incur additional substantial costs related to the remediation of its former MGP sites. Based upon prior MPSC orders, Consumers expects to be able to recover the costs of these cleanup activities through its gas rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome. Consumers also expects to incur remediation and other response activity costs at a number of other sites under NREPA and CERCLA. Consumers believes these costs should be recoverable in rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome. In addition, CMS Energy retained environmental remediation obligations for the collection, treatment, and discharge of leachate at Bay Harbor after selling its interests in the development in 2002. Leachate is produced when water enters into cement kiln dust piles left over from former cement plant operations at the site. CMS Energy has signed agreements with the EPA and the MDEQ relating to Bay Harbor. If CMS Energy were unable to meet its commitments under these agreements, or if unanticipated events occurred, CMS Energy could incur additional material costs relating to its Bay Harbor remediation obligations. CMS Energy and Consumers could be affected adversely by legacy litigation and retained liabilities. CMS Energy, CMS MST, CMS Field Services, Cantera Natural Gas, Inc., and Cantera Gas Company were named as defendants in various lawsuits arising as a result of alleged inaccurate natural gas price 35Table of Contents reporting. Allegations include price-fixing conspiracies, restraint of trade, and artificial inflation of natural gas retail prices in Kansas, Missouri, and Wisconsin. CMS Energy cannot predict the outcome of the lawsuits or the amount of damages for which CMS Energy may be liable. It is possible that the outcome in one or more of the lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. The agreements that CMS Energy and Consumers enter into for the sale of assets customarily include provisions whereby they are required to: ·                 retain specified preexisting liabilities, such as for taxes, pensions, or environmental conditions·                 indemnify the buyers against specified risks, including the inaccuracy of representations and warranties that CMS Energy and Consumers make·                 make payments to the buyers depending on the outcome of post-closing adjustments, litigation, audits, or other reviews, including claims resulting from attempts by foreign or domestic governments to assess taxes on past operations or transactions Many of these contingent liabilities can remain open for extended periods of time after the sales are closed. Depending on the extent to which the buyers might ultimately seek to enforce their rights under these contractual provisions, and the resolution of any disputes concerning them, there could be a material adverse effect on CMS Energys or Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. In 2002, CMS Energy sold its oil, gas, and methanol investments in Equatorial Guinea. The government of Equatorial Guinea claims that CMS Energy owes $152 million in taxes, plus significant penalties and interest, in connection with the sale. The matter is proceeding to formal arbitration. CMS Energy is contesting the claim, but cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of the matter. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. CMS Energys and Consumers energy sales and operations are affected by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions from year to year. CMS Energys and Consumers utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment, while peak demand for natural gas occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as heating fuel. In addition, Consumers electric rates, which follow a seasonal rate design, are higher in the summer months than in the remaining months of the year. Accordingly, CMS Energys and Consumers overall results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Mild temperatures during the summer cooling season and winter heating season as well as the impact of extreme weather events on Consumers system could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Consumers is exposed to risks related to general economic conditions in its service territories. Consumers electric and gas utility businesses are affected by the economic conditions impacting the customers they serve. If the Michigan economy becomes sluggish or declines, Consumers could experience reduced demand for electricity or natural gas that could result in decreased earnings and cash flow. In addition, economic conditions in Consumers service territory affect its collections of accounts receivable and levels of lost or stolen gas, which in turn impact its liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. 36Table of Contents CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to information security risks, risks of unauthorized access to their systems, and technology failures. In the regular course of business, CMS Energy and Consumers handle a range of sensitive security and customer information. CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to laws and rules issued by various agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of this information. A security breach of CMS Energys and Consumers information or control systems could involve theft or the inappropriate release of certain types of information, such as confidential customer information or, separately, system operating information. These events could disrupt operations, subject CMS Energy and Consumers to possible financial liability, damage their reputation and diminish the confidence of customers, and have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial conditions, and results of operations. CMS Energy and Consumers operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information and control technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite implementation of security measures, technology systems are vulnerable to being disabled, failures, cyber crime, and unauthorized access. These events could impact the reliability of electric generation and electric and gas delivery and also subject CMS Energy and Consumers to financial harm. Cyber crime, which includes the use of malware, computer viruses, and other means for disruption or unauthorized access against companies, including CMS Energy and Consumers, has increased in frequency, scope, and potential impact in recent years. While CMS Energy and Consumers have not been subject to cyber crime incidents that have had a material impact on their operations to date, their security measures in place may be insufficient to prevent a major cyber incident in the future. If technology systems were to fail or be breached, CMS Energy and Consumers might not be able to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive confidential and proprietary data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, because CMS Energys and Consumers generation, transmission, and distribution systems are part of an interconnected system, a disruption caused by a cyber incident at another utility, electric generator, system operator, or commodity supplier could also adversely affect CMS Energys or Consumers businesses, financial condition, and results of operations. A variety of technological tools and systems, including both company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties, support critical functions. The failure of these technologies, or the inability of CMS Energy and Consumers to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded, or integrated into other technologies, could hinder their business operations and materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. CMS Energys and Consumers businesses have liability risks. Consumers electric and gas delivery systems, power plants, gas infrastructure including storage facilities, wind energy or solar equipment, energy products, and the independent power plants owned in whole or in part by CMS Energy could be involved in incidents, failures, or accidents that result in injury, loss of life, or property loss to customers, employees, or the public. Although CMS Energy and Consumers have insurance coverage for many potential incidents (subject to deductibles and self-insurance amounts that could be material), depending upon the nature or severity of any incident, failure, or accident, CMS Energy or Consumers could suffer financial loss, reputational damage, and negative repercussions from regulatory agencies or other public authorities. CMS Energys and Consumers revenues and results of operations are subject to risks that are beyond their control, including but not limited to natural disasters, terrorist attacks and related acts of war, cyber incidents, vandalism, and other catastrophic events. The impact of natural disasters, severe weather, wars, terrorist acts, vandalism, cyber incidents, pandemics, and other catastrophic events on the facilities and operations of CMS Energy and Consumers 37Table of Contents could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. These events could result in severe damage to CMS Energys and Consumers assets beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies, could require CMS Energy and Consumers to incur significant upfront costs, and could severely disrupt operations, resulting in loss of service to customers. There is also a risk that regulators could, after the fact, conclude that Consumers preparedness or response to such an event was inadequate and take adverse actions as a result. CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to significant reputational risks. CMS Energy and Consumers could suffer negative impacts to their reputations as a result of operational incidents, violations of corporate policies, regulatory violations, inappropriate use of social media, or other events. Reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. It could also result in negative customer perception and increased regulatory oversight. Consumers is exposed to changes in customer usage that could impact financial results. Distributed electricity generation: Technology advances and government incentives and subsidies could increase the cost effectiveness of customer-owned methods of producing electricity, such as fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines, and solar photovoltaics, resulting in reduced load, cross subsidization, and increased costs. This could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Energy efficiency: Customers could reduce their consumption through demand-side energy conservation and energy efficiency programs. These reductions could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Energy risk management strategies might not be effective in managing fuel and electricity pricing risks, which could result in unanticipated liabilities to CMS Energy and Consumers or increased volatility in their earnings. Consumers is exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas, coal, electric capacity, electric energy, emission allowances, gasoline, diesel fuel, and RECs. Prices for these commodities may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and expose Consumers to price risk. A substantial portion of Consumers operating expenses for its electric generating plants and vehicle fleet consists of the costs of obtaining these commodities. The contracts associated with Consumers fuel and purchased power costs are executed in conjunction with the PSCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover prudently incurred costs associated with those positions. If the MPSC determined that any of these contracts or related contracting policies were imprudent, recovery of these costs could be disallowed. Consumers manages commodity price risk using established policies and procedures, and it may use various contracts to manage this risk, including swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts. No assurance can be made that these strategies will be successful in managing Consumers pricing risk or that they will not result in net liabilities to Consumers as a result of future volatility in these markets. Natural gas prices in particular have been historically volatile. Consumers routinely enters into contracts to mitigate exposure to the risks of demand, market effects of weather, and changes in commodity prices associated with its gas distribution business. These contracts are executed in conjunction with the GCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover prudently incurred costs associated with those positions. If the MPSC determined that any of these contracts or related contracting policies were imprudent, recovery of these costs could be disallowed. Consumers does not always hedge the entire exposure of its operations from commodity price volatility. Furthermore, the ability to hedge exposure to commodity price volatility depends on liquid commodity markets. As a result, to the extent the commodity markets are illiquid, Consumers might not be able to execute its risk management strategies, which could result in larger unhedged positions than preferred at a given time. To the extent that 38Table of Contents unhedged positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices could have a negative effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes in laws that limit Consumers ability to hedge could also have a negative effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to counterparty risk. Adverse economic conditions or financial difficulties experienced by counterparties with whom CMS Energy and Consumers do business could impair the ability of these counterparties to pay for CMS Energys and Consumers services and/or fulfill their contractual obligations, including performance and payment of damages. CMS Energy and Consumers depend on these counterparties to remit payments and perform contracted services in a timely fashion. Any delay or default in payment or performance of contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Volatility and disruptions in capital and credit markets could have a negative impact on CMS Energys and Consumers lenders, vendors, contractors, suppliers, customers, and other counterparties, causing them to fail to meet their obligations. Adverse economic conditions could also have a negative impact on the loan portfolio of CMS Energys banking subsidiary, EnerBank. Consumers might not be able to obtain an adequate supply of natural gas or coal, which could limit its ability to operate its electric generation facilities or serve its natural gas customers. Consumers has natural gas and coal supply and transportation contracts in place for the natural gas and coal it requires for its electric generating capacity. Consumers also has interstate transportation and supply agreements in place to facilitate delivery of natural gas to its customers. Apart from the contractual and monetary remedies available to Consumers in the event of a counterpartys failure to perform under any of these contracts, there can be no assurances that the counterparties to these contracts will fulfill their obligations to provide natural gas or coal to Consumers. The counterparties under the agreements could experience financial or operational problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to Consumers. In addition, counterparties under these contracts might not be required to supply natural gas or coal to Consumers under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster or severe weather. If, for its electric generating capacity, Consumers were unable to obtain its natural gas or coal requirements under existing or future natural gas and coal supply and transportation contracts, it could be required to purchase natural gas or coal at higher prices or forced to purchase electricity from higher-cost generating resources in the MISO energy market. If, for natural gas delivery to its customers, Consumers were unable to obtain its natural gas supply requirements under existing or future natural gas supply and transportation contracts, it could be required to purchase natural gas at higher prices from other sources or implement its natural gas curtailment program filed with the MPSC. These alternatives could increase Consumers working capital requirements and could decrease its revenues. Market performance and other changes could decrease the value of employee benefit plan assets, which then could require substantial funding. The performance of the capital markets affects the values of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under CMS Energys and Consumers pension and postretirement benefit plans. CMS Energy and Consumers have significant obligations under these plans and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which could fall below CMS Energys and Consumers forecasted return rates. A decline in the market value of the assets or a change in the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels could significantly increase the funding requirements of these obligations. Also, changes in demographics, including an increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, could 39Table of Contents significantly increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and postretirement benefit plans. If CMS Energy and Consumers were unable to manage their pension and postretirement plan assets successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. A work interruption or other union actions could adversely affect Consumers. Over 40 percent of Consumers employees are represented by unions. In 2015, both of Consumers unions, representing all union employees, ratified three separate five-year agreements, expiring in 2020. If these employees were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, Consumers could experience a significant disruption in its operations and higher ongoing labor costs. Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact CMS Energys and Consumers results of operations. The workforce of CMS Energy and Consumers is aging and a number of employees will become eligible to retire within the next few years. If CMS Energy and Consumers were unable to match skill sets to future needs, they could encounter operating challenges and increased costs. These challenges could include a lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and delays in skill development. Additionally, higher costs could result from the use of contractors to replace employees, loss of productivity, and safety incidents. Failing to train replacement employees adequately and to transfer internal knowledge and expertise could adversely affect CMS Energys and Consumers ability to manage and operate their businesses. If CMS Energy and Consumers were unable to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, their financial condition and results of operations could be affected negatively. Unplanned power plant outages could be costly for Consumers. Unforeseen maintenance of Consumers power plants may be required for many reasons, including catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, extreme weather, floods or other acts of God, equipment failure, operator error, or the need to comply with environmental or safety regulations. When unplanned maintenance work is required on power plants or other equipment, Consumers will not only incur unexpected maintenance expenses, but it may also have to make spot market purchases of replacement electricity that exceed Consumers costs of generation or be forced to retire a given unit if the cost or timing of the maintenance is not reasonable and prudent. Additionally, unplanned maintenance work could reduce the capacity credit Consumers receives from MISO and could cause Consumers to incur additional capacity costs in future years. If Consumers were unable to recover any of these increased costs in rates, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact CMS Energy and Consumers. CMS Energy and Consumers are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. The tax obligations include income, real estate, sales and use taxes, employment-related taxes, and ongoing issues related to these tax matters. The judgments include determining reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken and may be subject to challenge by the IRS and/or other taxing authorities. Unfavorable settlements of any of the issues related to these reserves or other tax matters at CMS Energy or Consumers could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to changing tax laws. Increases in federal, state, or local tax rates or other changes in tax laws could have adverse impacts on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. 40Table of Contents CMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers and EnerBank, must comply with the Dodd-Frank Act and its related regulations, which are subject to change and could involve material costs or affect operations. Regulations that are intended to implement the Dodd-Frank Act have been and are still being adopted by the appropriate agencies. The Dodd-Frank Act added a new Section 13 to the Bank Holding Company Act. Known as the Volcker Rule, it generally restricts certain banking entities (such as EnerBank) and their subsidiaries or affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading activities and from owning equity in or sponsoring any private equity or hedge fund. The statutory effective date of the Volcker Rule was July 2012, but it is subject to certain transition periods and exceptions for permitted activities. In 2013, the Federal Reserve Board issued final regulations clarifying that banks and other financial institutions had until 2015 to conform fully their activities and investments to the requirements. In December 2014, the Federal Reserve Board issued an order extending to July 2016 the date by which banking entities must comply with the Volcker Rules prohibition on owning interests in covered funds and further indicated its intention to grant another extension, in December 2015, of the covered funds deadline to July 2017. Under the statute, the activities of CMS Energy and its subsidiaries (including EnerBank) are not expected to be materially affected; however, they will be restricted from engaging in proprietary trading, investing in third-party hedge or private equity funds, and sponsoring these funds in the future unless CMS Energy qualifies for an exemption from the rule. CMS Energy and its subsidiaries are also subject to certain ongoing compliance requirements pursuant to the regulations. CMS Energy cannot predict the full impact of the Volcker Rule on CMS Energys or EnerBanks operations or financial condition. Effective July 2011, all companies that directly or indirectly control an FDIC-insured bank are required to serve as a source of financial strength for that institution. As a result, CMS Energy could be called upon by the FDIC to infuse additional capital into EnerBank to the extent that EnerBank fails to satisfy its capital requirements. In addition, CMS Energy is contractually required (i) to make cash capital contributions to EnerBank in the event that EnerBank does not maintain required minimum capital ratios and (ii) to provide EnerBank financial support, in an amount and duration as may be necessary for EnerBank to meet the cash needs of its depositors and other operations. EnerBank has exceeded these requirements historically and exceeds them as of February 2016. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of certain commodity-related contracts. Although CMS Energy, Consumers, and CMS ERM qualify for an end-user exception from mandatory clearing of commodity-related swaps, these regulations could affect the ability of these entities to participate in these markets and could add additional regulatory oversight over their contracting activities. "

RISK FACTORS   Actual results in future periods for CMS Energy and Consumers could differ materially from historical results and theforward-looking statements contained in this report. Factors that might cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the following sections.CMS Energy's and Consumers' businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, that involve uncertainties that may materially affect results, and that are often beyondtheir control. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that the companies' management believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the companies. The risk factors described inthe following sections, as well as the other information included in this report and in other documents filed with the SEC, should be considered carefully before making an investment in securities ofCMS Energy orConsumers. Risk factors of Consumers are also risk factors of CMS Energy. All of these risk factors are potentially significant.  CMS Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service obligations.  Due to its holding company structure, CMS Energy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other paymentobligations. Consumers' ability to pay dividends or acquire its own stock from CMS Energy is limited by restrictions contained in Consumers' preferred stock provisions and potentially by otherlegal restrictions, such as certain terms in its articles of incorporation, and by FERC requirements. At December 31, 2012, under its articles of incorporation, Consumers had$536 million of unrestricted retained earnings available to pay common stock dividends. If sufficient dividends are not paid to CMS Energy by its subsidiaries, CMS Energy may notbe able to generate the funds necessary to fulfill its payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's liquidity and financial condition.  CMS Energy has indebtedness that could limit its financial flexibility and its ability to meet its debt service obligations.  At December 31, 2012, CMS Energy, including Consumers, had $7.2 billion aggregate principal amount of indebtedness.CMS Energy had $2.4 billion aggregate principal amount of indebtedness at December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2012, there were no borrowings and $2 million of lettersof credit outstanding under CMS Energy's revolving credit agreement. CMS Energy and its subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Thelevel of CMS Energy's present and future indebtedness could have several important effects on its future operations, including, amongothers:a significant portion of CMS Energy's cash flow from operations could be dedicated to the payment of principal andinterest on its indebtedness and would not be available for other purposes; covenants contained in CMS Energy's existing debt arrangements, which require it to meet certainfinancial tests,could affect its flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in its business; CMS Energy's ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, andgeneral corporate and other purposes could become limited; CMS Energy could be placed at a competitive disadvantage to its competitors that are less leveraged; 31 Table of ContentsCMS Energy's vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions could increase;andCMS Energy's future credit ratings could fluctuate. CMS Energy'sability to meet its debt service obligations and to reduce its total indebtedness will depend on its future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions,industry cycles, changes in laws or regulatory decisions, and financial, business, and other factors affecting its operations, many of which are beyond its control. CMS Energy cannot makeassurances that its business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness. If CMS Energy is unable to generate sufficient cash flows fromoperations, it may be required to sell assets or obtain additional financing. CMS Energy cannot ensure that additional financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all.  CMS Energy and Consumers have financing needs and could be unable to obtain bank financing or access the capital markets. Potential disruption in the capital andcredit markets could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' businesses, including the availability and cost of short-term funds for liquidity requirements andtheir ability to meet long-term commitments. These consequences could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results ofoperations.  CMS Energy and Consumers may be subject to liquidity demands under commercial commitments, guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, andother contingent liabilities. Consumers' capital requirements are expected to be substantial over the next severalyears as it implements renewable power generation and environmental projects, and those requirements may increase if additional laws or regulations are adopted or implemented. CMS Energyand Consumers rely on the capital markets, particularly for publicly offered debt, as well as on bank syndications, to meet their financial commitments and short-termliquidity needs if internal funds are not available from Consumers' operations and, in the case of CMS Energy, dividends from Consumers and its other subsidiaries. CMS Energy andConsumers also use letters of credit issued under certain of their revolving credit facilities to support certain operations and investments. Longerterm disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions couldadversely affect CMS Energy's and Consumers' access to liquidity needed for their respective businesses, as could Consumers' inability to obtain prior FERC authorization for any securitiesissuances, including publicly offered debt, as is required under the Federal Power Act. Any disruption or inability to obtain FERC authorization could require CMS Energy and Consumers to takemeasures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for their business needs can be arranged. These measures could include deferring capitalexpenditures, changing CMS Energy's and Consumers' commodity purchasing strategy to avoid collateral-posting requirements, and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases, dividendpayments, or other discretionary uses of cash. CMS Energycontinues to explore financing opportunities to supplement its financial plan. These potential opportunities include refinancing and/or issuing new debt, preferred stock and/orcommon equity, and bank financing. Similarly, Consumers plans to seek funds through the capital markets, commercial lenders, and leasing arrangements. Entering into new financings is subject in partto capital market receptivity to utility industry securities in general and to CMS Energy's and Consumers' securities in particular. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot 32 Table of Contentsguaranteethe capital markets' acceptance of their securities or predict the impact of factors beyond their control, such as actions of rating agencies. If CMS Energy or Consumers is unable toobtain bank financing or access the capital markets to incur or refinance indebtedness, or is unable to obtain commercially reasonable terms for any financing, there could be a material adverse effecton its liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Certainof CMS Energy's securities and those of its affiliates, including Consumers, are rated by various credit rating agencies. Any reduction or withdrawal of one or more of its creditratingscould have a material adverse impact on CMS Energy's or Consumers' ability to access capital on acceptable terms and maintain commodity lines of credit, could make its cost of borrowing higher,and could cause CMS Energy or Consumers to reduce its capital expenditures. If it is unable to maintain commodity lines of credit, CMS Energy or Consumers may have to post collateral ormake prepayments to certain of its suppliers under existing contracts. Further, since Consumers provides dividends to CMS Energy, any adverse developments affecting Consumers that result in alowering of its credit ratings could have an adverse effect on CMS Energy's credit ratings. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot guarantee that any of their present ratings will remain ineffect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency.  There are risks associated with Consumers' significant capital investment program planned for the next five years.  Consumers' planned investments include the Smart Energy program, new power generation, gas compression, environmental controls, and other electricand gas infrastructure to upgrade delivery systems. The success of these investments depends on or could be affected by a variety of factors including, but not limited to, effective cost and schedulemanagement during implementation, changes in commodity and other prices, operational performance, changes in environmental, legislative and regulatory requirements, and regulatory cost recovery.Consumers cannot predict the impact that any of these factors could have on the success of its capital investment program. It is possible that adverse events associated with these factors could have amaterial adverse effect on Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.  Electric industry legislation in Michigan, coupled with increased competition in gas and electric markets, could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's andConsumers' businesses.  The 2008 Energy Law, among other things, limits alternative electric supply to ten percent of weather-adjusted retail sales for the precedingcalendar year. Lower natural gas prices due to a large supply of natural gas on the market, coupled with low capacity prices in the electric supply market, are placing increasing competitive pressureon Consumers' electric supply. Presently, Consumers' electric rates are above the Midwest average, while the ROA level on Consumers' system is at the ten-percent cap and the proportion ofConsumers' electric deliveries under the ROA program and on the ROA waiting list is 25 percent. In February 2013, a proposal was made to raise the ROA limit above ten percent. If the bill isenacted, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers' business. In addition, the Michigan legislature is conducting hearings on the subject of energy competition. If other bills to raise theROA limit above ten percent are proposed in the future and enacted, they could have a material adverse effect on Consumers' business. Recently,the Michigan governor announced a process pursuant to which a series of reports are to be completed in December 2013 addressing energy efficiency, renewable energy, the electricity marketand customer choice, and other subjects. The process is designed to help the 33 Table of Contentsgovernorand other lawmakers determine the state's next steps regarding energy policies. A series of public hearings have been scheduled in 2013 to gather input. Consumers expects to participateactively in this process but cannot predict its outcome. Othernew legislation or interpretations could change how the businesses of CMS Energy and Consumers operate, impact Consumers' ability to recover costs through rate increases, or requireCMS Energy and Consumers to incur additional expenses.  CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation, which could have an adverse effect on financial results.  CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation. Electric and gas rates for their utilities are set by the MPSC and cannot beincreased without regulatory authorization. While Consumers is permitted by the 2008 Energy Law to self-implement rate changes six months after a rate filing with the MPSC, subject tocertain limitations, if a final rate order from the MPSC provides for lower rates than Consumers self-implemented, Consumers must refund the difference, with interest. Also, the MPSC maydelay or deny implementation of a rate increase upon showing of good cause. In February 2011, the MPSC found good cause to delay Consumers' self-implementation of its requested gas rateincrease. Consumers did not experience delays in self-implementation of rate increases in 2012. Inaddition, Consumers' plans for making significant capital investments, including modifications to meet new environmental requirements and investment in new generation, could be affected adverselyor could have a material adverse effect on Consumers if rate regulators fail to provide timely rate relief or to approve a Certificate of Necessity for new generation. Regulators seeking to avoid orminimize rate increases could resist raising customer rates sufficiently to permit Consumers to recover the full cost of modifications to meet environmental requirements and other prudent investments.In addition, because certain costs are mandated by state requirements for cost recovery, such as resource additions to meet Michigan's renewable resource standard, regulators could be more inclined tooppose rate increases for other requireditems and investments. Rate regulators could also face pressure to avoid or limit rate increases for a number of reasons, including failure of Michigan's economy to improve sufficiently ordiminishment of Consumers' customer base. In addition to potentially affecting Consumers' investment program, any limitation of cost recovery through rates could have a material adverse effect onConsumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Ordersof the MPSC could limit recovery of costs of providing service including, but not limited to, environmental and safety related expenditures for coal-fueled plants and other utilityproperties, power supply and natural gas supply costs, operating and maintenance expenses, additional utility-based investments, sunk investment in mothballed or retired coal-fueled generating plants,costs associated with the proposed retirement and decommissioning of facilities, depreciation expense, MISO energy and transmission costs, costs associated with energy efficiency investments and stateor federally mandated renewable resource standards, Smart Energy program costs, or expenditures subjected to tracking mechanisms. These orders could also result in adverse regulatory treatment ofother matters including, but not limited to, prevention or curtailment of shutoffs for non-paying customers, Consumers' gas revenue decoupling mechanism, prevention or curtailment ofrights to self-implement rate requests, or refunds of previously self-implemented rates. FERCauthorizes certain subsidiaries of CMS Energy to sell electricity at market-based rates. Failure of CMS Energy and Consumers to obtain adequate rates or regulatory approvals in a 34 Table of Contentstimelymanner could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Thevarious risks associated with the MPSC and FERC regulation of CMS Energy's and Consumers' businesses, which include the risk of adverse decisions in any number of rate or regulatoryproceedings before either agency, as well as judicial proceedings challenging any such agency decisions, could have a substantial negative effect on the companies' investment plans and results ofoperations.  Electric industry regulation could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' businesses.  Federal and state regulation of electric utilities has changed dramatically in the last two decades and could continue to change over the nextseveral years. These changes could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. CMS Energyand Consumers are subject to, or affected by, extensive federal and state utility regulation. In CMS Energy's and Consumers' business planning and management of operations,they must address the effects of existing and proposed regulation on their businesses and changes in the regulatory framework, including initiatives by federal and state legislatures, regionaltransmission organizations, utility regulators, and taxing authorities. Adoption of new regulations by federal or state agencies, or changes to present regulations and interpretations of theseregulations, could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Thereare multiple proceedings pending before FERC involving transmission matters. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the impact of these electric industry restructuring proceedings ontheir liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.  Periodic reviews of the values of CMS Energy's and Consumers' assets could result in impairment charges.  CMS Energy and Consumers are required by GAAP to review periodically the carrying value of their assets, including those that may be sold.Market conditions, the operational characteristics of their assets, and other factors could result in recording impairment charges for their assets, which could have an adverse effect on theirstockholders equity and their access to additional financing. In addition, CMS Energy and Consumers may be required to record impairment charges at the time they sell assets, depending on thesale prices they are able to secure and other factors.  CMS Energy and Consumers could incur significant costs to comply with environmental requirements.  CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to costly and increasingly stringent environmental regulations. They believe thatenvironmental laws andregulations related to their operations will continue to become more stringent and require them to make additional significant capital expenditures for emissions control equipment. In2011, the EPA finalized and promulgated CSAPR as a replacement for CAIR. In August 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit voided CSAPR and held that CAIR would 35 Table of Contentsremainin place until the EPA promulgated a new rule. A request by the EPA for a rehearing of this ruling was denied. InDecember 2011, the EPA issued the maximum achievable control technology standard for electric generating units, also known as MATS. This rule is expected to have a significant impact on Consumers'coal-fueled generating fleet. Inaddition, the EPA is continually in the process of tightening standards for air quality. The EPA recently proposed new rules relating to fine particulate matter and ozone. These changes could alsohave a significant impact on Consumers' coal-fueled generating fleet. InMay 2010, the EPA issued a final rule that addresses greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources under the Clean Air Act permitting programs. The ""tailoring rule"" sets thresholds forgreenhouse gas emissions that define when permits under the NSR and Title V programs are required for new and existing industrial facilities. This regulation took effect in January 2011. In March2012, the EPA released its proposed ""Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions for New Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units."" The proposed rule applies only to newfossil-fuel-fired steam electric generating units and would require that carbon dioxide emissions not exceed those of a modern, efficient natural gas combined-cycle-plant,regardless of fuel type. The EPA is also expected to propose emissions guidelines within the next one to three years for states to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from existing generating stations.In addition, legislation to regulate, control, or limit greenhouse gases could be enacted in the future by the U.S. Congress. In2012, 98 percent of the energy generated by Consumers came from fossil-fueled power plants, with 80 percent coming from coal-fueled power plants. CMS Enterprisesalso has interests in fossil-fueled power plants and other types of power plants that produce greenhouse gases. The aforementioned federal laws and rules, as well as additional laws and rules, ifenacted, and international accords and treaties, could require CMS Energy and Consumers to install additional equipment for emission controls, purchase carbon emissions allowances, curtailoperations, invest in non-fossil-fuel generating capacity, or take other significant steps to manage or lower the emission of greenhouse gases. Thefollowing risks related to climate change and emissions could also have a material adverse impact on CMS Energy's and Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results ofoperations:litigation originated by third parties against CMS Energy, Consumers, or their subsidiaries due toCMS Energy's or Consumers' greenhouse gas or other emissions; impairment of CMS Energy's or Consumers' reputation due to their greenhouse gas or other emissions and publicperception of their response to potential environmental regulations, rules, and legislation; and extreme weather conditions, such as severe storms, that may affect customer demand,company operations, or assets. TheEPA is considering regulating CCRs, such as coal ash, as hazardous wastes under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Michigan already regulates CCRs as low-hazard industrialwaste. If coal ash is regulated as a hazardous waste, Consumers would likely cease the beneficial re-use of this product, resulting in significantly more coal ash requiring costlydisposal. Additionally, it is possible that existing landfills could be closed if the upgrades to hazardous waste landfill standards are economically prohibitive. Costs associated with this potentialregulation could be substantial. 36 Table of ContentsTheEPA is revising regulations that govern cooling water intake structures aimed at protecting aquatic life and that govern water discharges. Costs associated with these revisions could be materialto CMS Energy, Consumers, and CMS Enterprises and result in operational changes or possibly significant impacts on the economics of generating units. In addition, the EPA is expected topropose new regulations in 2013 for wastewater discharges from electric generatingplants. These new regulations may require physical and/or chemical treatment facilities for all waste water. CMS Energyand Consumers expect to collect fully from their customers, through the ratemaking process, expenditures incurred to comply with environmental regulations, but cannot guarantee thisoutcome. If Consumers were unable to recover these expenditures from customers in rates, it could negatively affect CMS Energy's and/or Consumers' liquidity, results of operations, andfinancial condition and CMS Energy and/or Consumers could be required to seek significant additional financing to fund these expenditures. Foradditional information regarding compliance with environmental regulations, see Item 1. Business, CMS Energy and Consumers Environmental Compliance and Item 8. FinancialStatements and Supplementary Data, MD&A, Outlook, ""Consumers Electric Utility Business Outlook and Uncertainties.""  CMS Energy's and Consumers' businesses could be affected adversely by any delay in meeting environmental requirements.  A delay or failure by CMS Energy or Consumers to obtain or maintain any necessary environmental permits, approvals under the MISO tariff, orapprovals to satisfy any applicable environmental regulatory requirements or install emission control equipment could:prevent the construction of new facilities; prevent the continued operation and sale of energy from existing facilities;prevent the suspension of operations at existing facilities; prevent the modification of existing facilities; orresult in significant additional costs that could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition,and results of operations.  CMS Energy and Consumers expect to incur additional significant costs related to remediation of legacy environmental sites.  Consumers is presently monitoring or remediating 23 former MGP sites. Consumers is working collaboratively with the MDEQ to agree upon executableremediation plans. About one-third of the 23 sites have been remediated to the extent possible and are now being monitored. The remaining sites are being actively remediated throughexcavation, treatment at the site, containment, and/or natural reduction; two of these sites require complex remediation plans due to the involvement of surface water. TheMDEQ established a ""No Further Action"" status for these sites and others like them in late 2010 and is presently overhauling the implementation of the 2010 statutory revisions with a focus onstreamlining the process, reasonable and consistent implementation, and risk-based techniques. CMS Energyand Consumers expect to incur additional significant costs related to the remediation of these former MGP sites. Based upon prior MPSC orders, Consumers expects to 37 Table of Contentsbeable to recover the costs of these cleanup activities through its gas rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome. Inaddition, CMS Energy retained environmental remediation obligations for the collection and treatment of leachate at Bay Harbor after selling its interests in the development in 2002.Leachate is produced when water enters into cement kiln dust piles left over from former cement plant operations at the site. CMS Energy has signed agreements with the EPA and the MDEQ relatingto Bay Harbor. If CMS Energy were unable to meet its commitments under these agreements, or if unanticipated events occurred, CMS Energy could incur additional material costs relating toits Bay Harbor remediation obligations. Consumersalso expects to incur remediation and other response activity costs at a number of other sites under NREPA and Superfund. Consumers believes these costs should be recoverable in rates, butcannot guarantee that outcome.  CMS Energy and Consumers could be affected adversely by legacy litigation and retained liabilities.  In 2002, CMS Energy notified appropriate regulatory and governmental agencies that some employees at CMS MST and CMS FieldServices appeared to have provided inaccurate information regarding natural gas trades to various energy industry publications which compile and report index prices. CMS Energy has cooperatedwith the DOJ's investigation regarding this matter. CMS Energy is unable to predict the outcome of the DOJ investigation or the amount of any fines or penalties that may be imposed and whateffect, if any, the investigation will have on CMS Energy. CMS Energy,CMS MST, CMS Field Services, Cantera Natural Gas, Inc., and Cantera Gas Company were named as defendants in various lawsuits arising as a result of allegedfalse natural gas price reporting. Allegations included manipulation of NYMEX natural gas futures and options prices, price-fixing conspiracies, and artificial inflation of natural gas retail pricesin Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, and Wisconsin. CMS Energy cannot predict the outcome of the lawsuits or the amount of damages for which CMS Energy may be liable. It is possible that theoutcome in one or more of the lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Theagreements that CMS Energy and Consumers enter into for the sale of assets customarily include provisions whereby they are required to:retain specified preexisting liabilities, such as for taxes, pensions, or environmental conditions; indemnify the buyers againstspecified risks, including the inaccuracy of representations and warranties thatCMS Energy and Consumers make; and make payments to the buyers depending on the outcome of post-closing adjustments, litigation, audits, or otherreviews, including claims resulting from attempts by foreign or domestic governments to assess taxes on past operations or transactions. Manyof these contingent liabilities can remain open for extended periods of time after the sales are closed. Depending on the extent to which the buyers may ultimately seek to enforce their rightsunder these contractual provisions, and the resolution of any disputes concerning them, there could be a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's or Consumers' liquidity, financial condition,and results of operations. 38 Table of ContentsInJanuary 2002, CMS Energy sold its oil, gas, and methanol investments in Equatorial Guinea. The government of Equatorial Guinea claims that CMS Energy owes $142 million intaxes, plus interest, in connection with the sale. CMS Energy has concluded that the government's tax claim is without merit. The government of Equatorial Guinea indicated through a request forarbitration in October 2011 that it still intends to pursue its claim. CMS Energy is vigorously contesting the claim, and cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter. It ispossible that the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.  CMS Energy's and Consumers' energy sales and operations are affected by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions from year to year.  CMS Energy's and Consumers' businesses are seasonal. Demand for electricity is greater in the summer cooling season and the winter heatingseason. Demand for natural gas peaks in the winter heating season. Accordingly, their overall results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Mild temperatures during the summercooling season and winter heating season could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.  Consumers is exposed to risks related to general economic conditions in its service territories.  Consumers' electric and gas utility businesses are affected by the economic conditions impacting the customers they serve. Although Consumersbelieves that economic conditions in Michigan are improving, the economy in Consumers' service territoriescontinues to be affected adversely by the recession and its impact on the state's automotive and real estate sectors and by relatively high unemployment. In addition, Consumers' largest singlecustomer has experienced sharply reduced electric demand. The Michigan economy also has been affected negatively by the uncertainty in the financial and credit markets. If economic conditions inMichigan decline further, Consumers may experience reduced demand for electricity or natural gas that could result in decreased earnings and cash flow. In addition, economic conditions in Consumers'service territory affect its collections of accounts receivable and levels of lost or stolen gas, which in turn impact its liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.  CMS Energy and Consumers are subject to information security risks, risks of unauthorized access to their systems, and technology failures.  In the regular course of business, CMS Energy and Consumers handle a range of sensitive security and customer information. CMS Energy and Consumersare subject to laws and rules issued by various agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of this information. A security breach of CMS Energy's and Consumers' informationsystems could involve theft or the inappropriate release of certain types of information, such as confidential customer information or, separately, system operating information. These events coulddisrupt operations, subject CMS Energy and Consumers to possible financial liability, damage their reputation and diminish the confidence of customers, and have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergy's and Consumers' liquidity, financial conditions, and results of operations. CMSEnergy and Consumers operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite implementationof security measures, CMS Energy's and Consumers' technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures, cyber crime, and unauthorized access. Those failures or breaches could impact thereliability of electric and gas generation and delivery and also subject 39 Table of ContentsCMSEnergy and Consumers to financial harm. Cyber crime, which includes the use of malware, computer viruses, and other means for disruption or unauthorized access against companies, including CMSEnergy and Consumers, has increased in frequency, scope, and potential impact in recent years. While CMS Energy and Consumers have not been subject to cyber crime incidents that have had a materialimpact on their operations to date, their security measures in place may be insufficient to prevent a major cyber attack in the future. If CMS Energy's and Consumers' technology systems were to failor be breached, CMS Energy and Consumers might not be able to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive confidential and proprietary datacould be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Avariety of technological tools and systems, including both company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties, support critical functions. The failure ofthese technologies, or the inability of CMS Energy and Consumers to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded, or integrated into other technologies, could hinder their business operationsand materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.  CMS Energy's and Consumers' businesses have safety risks.  Consumers' electric and gas delivery systems, power plants, gas infrastructure, and energy products could be involved in accidents that result ininjury or property loss to customers, employees, or the public. Although CMS Energy and Consumers have insurance coverage for many potential incidents (subject to deductibles andself-insurance amounts that could be material), depending upon the nature or severity of any incident or accident, CMS Energy or Consumers could suffer financial loss, damage to itsreputation, and negative repercussions from regulatory agencies or other public authorities.  CMS Energy's and Consumers' revenues and results of operations are subject to risks that are beyond their control, including but not limited to natural disasters, terroristattacks or related acts of war, hostile cyber intrusions, or other catastrophic events.  The impact of natural disasters, wars, terrorist acts, cyber intrusions, and other catastrophic events on the facilities and operations of CMS Energyand Consumers could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. A terrorist attack on physical infrastructure or a major natural disaster couldresult in severe damage to CMS Energy's and Consumers' assets beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies. Hostile cyber intrusions, including those targeting information systems as wellas electronic control systems used at the generating plants and for the electric and gas distribution systems, could severely disrupt business operations and result in loss of service to customers, aswell as significant expense to repair security breaches or system damage. Terrorist attacks or acts of war could result in the disruption of power and fuel markets that could increase costs or disruptservice. Widespread outages in Consumers' systems as a result of storms, floods, or other natural disasters could result in a prolonged loss of service to customers and significant expense to repairsystem damages. There is a risk that the regulators could assess Consumers' preparedness or response as inadequate and take adverse actions as a result. Instabilityin the financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, natural disasters, credit crises, recessions, or other factors, could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers'liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. 40 Table of Contents  CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to significant reputational risks.  Consumers is actively engaged in multiple regulatory oversight processes and has a large electric and gas customer base. As a result, Consumers has ahighly visible public profile in Michigan. Consumers and CMS Energy could suffer negative impacts to their reputations as a result of operational incidents, violations of corporate compliancepolicies, regulatory violations, or other events. This could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. It could alsoresult in negative customer perception and increased regulatory oversight.  The markets for alternative energy and distributed generation could impact financial results.  Advances in technology could reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing electricity, such as fuel cells, microturbines, windmills, andphotovoltaic (solar) cells, to a level that is competitive with that of fossil-fuel technology utilized by CMS Energy and Consumers to produce a majority of their electricity. It is alsopossible that electric customers could reduce their electric consumption significantly through demand-side energy conservation programs. Changes in technology could also alter the channelsthrough which electric customers buy electricity. Any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations.  Energy risk management strategies may not be effective in managing fuel and electricity pricing risks, which could result in unanticipated liabilities to CMS Energy andConsumers or increased volatility in their earnings.  Consumers is exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas, coal, electricity, emission allowances, and RECs. Prices for natural gas, coal,electricity, emission allowances, and RECs may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and expose Consumers to commodity price risk. A substantial portion of Consumers' operatingexpenses for its plants consists of the costs of obtaining these commodities. Consumers manages these risks using established policies and procedures, and it may use various contracts to manage theserisks, including swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts. No assurance can be made that these strategies will be successful in managing Consumers' pricing risk or that they will not result innet liabilities to Consumers as a result of future volatility in these markets. Naturalgas prices in particular have been historically volatile. Consumers routinely enters into contracts to mitigate exposure to the risks of demand, market effects of weather, and changes incommodity prices associated with its gas distribution business. These contracts are executed in conjunction with the GCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover prudently incurredcosts associated with those positions. If the MPSC determined that any of these contracts or related contracting policies were imprudent, recovery of these costs could be disallowed. Consumers doesnot always hedge the entire exposure of its operations from commodity price volatility. Furthermore, the ability to hedge exposure to commodity price volatility depends on liquid commodity markets. Asa result, to the extent the commodity markets are illiquid, Consumers may not be able to execute its risk management strategies, which could result in greater unhedged positions than preferred at agiven time. To the extent that unhedged positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices could have a negative effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results ofoperations. 41 Table of Contents CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to credit risk of those with whom they do business.  CMS Energy and Consumers are exposed to credit risk of counterparties with whom they do business. Adverse economic conditions or financialdifficulties experienced by these counterparties could impair the ability of these counterparties to pay for CMS Energy's and Consumers' services or fulfill their contractual obligations, includingperformance and payment of damages. CMS Energy and Consumers depend on these counterparties to remit payments and perform services timely. Any delay or default in payment or performance of contractualobligations could have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Inrecent years, the capital and credit markets have experienced unprecedented high levels of volatility and disruption. Market volatility and disruption could have a negative impact on CMS Energy'sand Consumers' lenders, suppliers, customers, and other counterparties, causing them to fail to meet their obligations. Adverse economic conditions could also have a negative impact on the loanportfolio of CMS Energy's banking subsidiary, EnerBank.  Consumers may not be able to obtain an adequate supply of coal or natural gas, which could limit its ability to operate its electric generation facilities or serve itsnatural gas customers.  Consumers is dependent on coal for a significant portion of its electric generating capacity. While Consumers has coal supply and transportationcontracts in place, there can be no assurance that the counterparties to these agreements will fulfill their obligations to supply coal to Consumers. The suppliers under the agreements may experiencefinancial or operational problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to Consumers. In addition, suppliers under these agreements may not be required to supply coal to Consumersunder certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. If Consumers were unable to obtain its coal requirements under existing or future coal supply and transportation contracts, itmight be required to purchase coal at higher prices or forced to purchase electricity from higher cost generating resources in the Midwest Energy Market, which would increase Consumers' workingcapital requirements. Consumershas firm interstate transportation and supply agreements in place to facilitate deliveries of natural gas to its customers. Apart from the contractual and monetary remedies available toConsumers in the event of a counterparty's failure to perform, there can be no assurances that the counterparties to these firm interstate transportation and supply agreements will fulfill theirobligations to provide natural gas to Consumers. In addition, suppliers under these agreements may not be required to deliver natural gas to Consumers in certain circumstances, such as in the event ofa natural disaster. If Consumers were unable to obtain its natural gas supply requirements under existing or future natural gas supply and transportation contracts, it could be required to purchasenatural gas at higher prices from other sources or implement its natural gas curtailment program filed with the MPSC, which would increase Consumers' working capital requirements and decrease itsnatural gas revenues.  Market performance and other changes could decrease the value of employee benefit plan assets, which then could require significant funding.  The performance of the capital markets affects the values of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under CMS Energy's andConsumers' pension and postretirement benefit plans. CMS Energy and Consumers have significant obligations under these plans and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject tomarket fluctuations and will 42 Table of Contentsyielduncertain returns, which may fall below CMS Energy's and Consumers' forecasted return rates. A decline in the market value of the assets or a change in the level of interest rates used tomeasure the required minimum funding levels may significantly increase the funding requirements of these obligations. Also, changes in demographics, including an increased number of retirements orchanges in life expectancy assumptions, may significantly increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and postretirement benefit plans. Additionally, while CMS Energyand Consumers presently do not expect that the Health Care Acts will significantly increase obligations of their postretirement benefit plans, they cannot guarantee this outcome. If CMS Energy andConsumers are unable to manage their pension and postretirement plan assets successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.  A work interruption or other union actions could adversely affect Consumers.  Over 40 percent of Consumers' employees are represented by unions. If these employees were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or otherslowdown, or if the terms and conditions in labor agreements were renegotiated, Consumers could experience a significant disruption in its operations and higher ongoing labor costs. Additionally,while Consumers presently has good relationships with the unions representing its employees, Consumers cannot predict the impact of recent Right to Work legislation on union negotiations andrelationships when existing union contracts expire.  Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm CMS Energy's and Consumers' results of operations.  The workforce of CMS Energy and Consumers is aging and a number of employees will become eligible to retire within the next few years. If CMS Energyand Consumers were unable to match skill sets to future needs, they could encounter operating challenges and increased costs. These challenges could include a lack of resources, loss of knowledge, anddelays in skill development. Additionally, higher costs could result from the use of contractors to replace employees, loss of productivity, and safety incidents. Failing to train replacementemployees adequately and to transfer internal knowledge and expertise could affect CMS Energy's and Consumers' ability to manage and operate their businesses. If CMS Energy and Consumers were unableto attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, their results of operations could be affected negatively.  Unplanned power plant outages could be costly for Consumers.  Unforeseen maintenance of our power plants may be required for many reasons, including catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, floods, orother acts of God, equipment failure, operator error, or to comply with environmental or safety regulations. When unplanned maintenance work is required on power plants or other equipment, Consumerswill not only incur unexpected maintenance expenses, but it may also have to make spot market purchases of replacement electricity that exceed Consumers' costs of generation. Additionally, unplannedmaintenance work may reduce the capacity credit Consumers receives from MISO and may cause Consumers to incur additional capacity costs in future years. If Consumers were unable to recover any ofthese increased costs in rates, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers' liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. 43 Table of Contents Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact CMS Energy's and Consumers' resultsof operations.  CMS Energy and Consumers are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results ofoperations in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. The tax obligations include income, real estate, sales and use taxes, employment-related taxes, and ongoing issues related tothese tax matters. The judgments include determining reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken and may be subject to challenge by the IRS and/or other taxingauthorities. Unfavorable settlements of any of the issues related to these reserves at CMS Energy or Consumers could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition, and resultsof operations. CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to changing tax laws. Increases in local, state, or federal tax rates or other changes in tax laws could have adverse impacts on their liquidity, financialcondition, and results of operations.  CMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers and EnerBank, must comply with the Dodd-Frank Act and its related regulations, which are subject to change and mayinvolve material costs or affect operations.  In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was passed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act is a sweeping piece of legislation, and the financialservices industry is still assessing the impacts. Congress detailed some significant changes, but the Dodd-Frank Act leaves many details to be determined by regulation and further study.Regulations that are intended to implement the Dodd-Frank Act are being adopted by the appropriate agencies. The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Bureau of Consumer FinancialProtection, which is part of the Federal Reserve and has been granted significant rule-making authority in the area of consumer financial products and services. The direction that theBureau of Consumer Financial Protection will take, the regulations it will adopt, and its interpretation of existing laws and regulations are not yet fully known. TheDodd-Frank Act added a new Section 13 to the Bank Holding Company Act. Known as the Volcker Rule, it generally restricts certain banking entities (such as EnerBank) and theirsubsidiaries or affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading activities and from owning equity in or sponsoring any private equity or hedge fund. The statutory effective date of the Volcker Rulewas July 2012, but it is subject to certain transition periods and exceptions for ""permitted activities."" In April 2012, the Federal Reserve Board issued a statement clarifying that banks and otherfinancial institutions have until July 2014 to conform fully their activities and investments to the requirements, but final implementing regulations have not yet been issued. Under the statute andbased on draft regulations issued in October 2011, the activities of CMS Energy and its subsidiaries (including EnerBank) are not expected to be materially affected; however, they would be restrictedfrom engaging in proprietary trading, investing in third-party hedge or private equity funds, and sponsoring these funds in the future unless CMS Energy qualified for an exemption from the rule. CMSEnergy cannot predict the full impact of the Volcker Rule on CMS Energy's or EnerBank's operations or financial condition until final regulations are issued. Furthermore,effective July 2011, all companies that directly or indirectly control an FDIC-insured bank are required to serve as a source of financial strength for that institution. As aresult, CMS Energy could be called upon by the FDIC to infuse additional capital into EnerBank to the extent that EnerBank fails to satisfy its capital requirements. In addition, CMS 44 Table of ContentsEnergyis contractually required (i) to make cash capital contributions to EnerBank in the event that EnerBank does not maintain required minimum capital ratios and (ii) to provideEnerBank financial support, in an amount and duration as may be necessary for EnerBank to meet the cash needs of its depositors and other operations. EnerBank has exceeded these requirementshistorically and exceeds them as of February 2013. Inaddition, the Dodd-Frank Act potentially provides for regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of certain energy-related contracts. CMS Energy expects that it and its subsidiarieswill qualify for an end-user exception, but these regulations could affect the ability of CMS Energy and its subsidiaries to participate in these markets and could add additional regulatory oversightover their contracting activities. Although CMS Energy and Consumers do not expect that this will have material impacts on their energy contracting activities, they cannot predict the outcome.  CMS Energy could be required to pay cash to certain security holders in connection with the optional conversion of their convertible securities.  CMS Energy has outstanding one series of cash-convertible securities, of which an aggregate principal amount of $172 million wasoutstanding at December 31, 2012. If the trading price of CMS Energy's common stock exceeds a specified amount at the end of a particular fiscal quarter, then holders of these convertiblesecurities will have the option to convert their securities in the following fiscal quarter, with the principal amount payable in cash by CMS Energy. Accordingly, if the trading price minimum issatisfied and security holders exercise their conversion rights, CMS Energy may be required to outlay a significant amount of cash to those security holders and recognize losses, which could have amaterial adverse effect on CMS Energy's liquidity and results of operations.  CMS Energy's and Consumers' financial statements, including their reported earnings, could be significantly impacted by convergence with International Financial ReportingStandards.  The Financial Accounting Standards Board is expected to make broad changes to GAAP as part of an overall initiative to converge U.S. standards withInternational Financial Reporting Standards. These changes could have significant impacts on the financial statements of CMS Energy and Consumers. Also, the SEC is considering incorporatingInternational Financial Reporting Standards into the financial reporting system for U.S. registrants. A transition to International Financial Reporting Standards could significantly impact CMSEnergy's and Consumers' financial results, since these standards differ from GAAP in many ways. One of the major differences is the lack of special accounting treatment for regulated activities underInternational Financial Reporting Standards, which could result in greater earnings volatility for CMS Energy and Consumers"

Due to its holding company structure, CMS Energy depends on dividends fromits subsidiaries to meet its debt obligations. Restrictions contained inConsumers' preferred stock provisions and other legal restrictions, such ascertain terms in its articles of incorporation, limit Consumers' ability to paydividends or acquire its own stock from CMS Energy. As of December 31, 2006, themost restrictive provisions in its financing documents allowed Consumers to payan aggregate of $300 million in dividends to CMS Energy during any year. AtDecember 31, 2006, Consumers had $215 million of unrestricted retained earningsavailable to pay common stock dividends. If sufficient dividends are not paid toCMS Energy by its subsidiaries, CMS Energy may not be able to generate the fundsnecessary to fulfill its cash obligations, thereby adversely affecting itsliquidity and financial condition.CMS ENERGY HAS SUBSTANTIAL INDEBTEDNESS THAT COULD LIMIT ITS FINANCIALFLEXIBILITY AND HENCE ITS ABILITY TO MEET ITS DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS.     As of December 31, 2006, CMS Energy had outstanding approximately $2.450billion aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, including approximately $178million of subordinated indebtedness relating to its convertible preferredsecurities but excluding approximately $4.495 billion of indebtedness of itssubsidiaries. In May 2005, CMS Energy entered into the Sixth Amended andRestated Credit Agreement in the amount of approximately $300 million. As ofDecember 31, 2006, there were approximately $98 million of letters of creditoutstanding under the Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. CMS Energyand its subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future.     The level of CMS Energy's present and future indebtedness could haveseveral important effects on its future operations, including, among others:     - a significant portion of its cash flow from operations will be dedicated       to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness and will not       be available for other purposes;     - covenants contained in its existing debt arrangements require it to meet       certain financial tests, which may affect its flexibility in planning       for, and reacting to, changes in its business;     - its ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital       expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes may       be limited;     - it may be at a competitive disadvantage to its competitors that are less       leveraged; and     - its vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions may       increase.     CMS Energy's ability to meet its debt service obligations and to reduce itstotal indebtedness will be dependent upon its future performance, which will besubject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, businessand other factors affecting its operations, many of which are beyond itscontrol. CMS Energy cannot make assurances that its business will continue togenerate sufficient cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness. If itis unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, it may be requiredto sell additional assets or obtain additional financings. CMS Energy cannotassure that additional financing will be available on commercially acceptableterms or at all.CMS ENERGY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF CLAIMS REGARDING ITS PARTICIPATION INTHE DEVELOPMENT OF BAY HARBOR OR OTHER LITIGATION IN WHICH SUBSTANTIAL MONETARYCLAIMS ARE INVOLVED.     As part of the development of Bay Harbor by certain subsidiaries of CMSEnergy, which went forward under an agreement with the MDEQ, third partiesconstructed a golf course and a park over several abandoned cement kiln dust(CKD) piles, left over from the former cement plant operation on the Bay Harborsite. Pursuant to the agreement with the MDEQ, a water collection system wasconstructed to recover seep water from one of the CKD piles and CMS Energy builta treatment plant to treat the seep water. In 2002, CMS Energy sold its interestin Bay                                       26Harbor, but retained its obligations under previous environmentalindemnifications entered into at the inception of the project.     In September 2004, the MDEQ issued a notice of noncompliance after findinghigh-pH seep water in Lake Michigan adjacent to the property. The MDEQ alsofound higher than acceptable levels of heavy metals, including mercury, in theseep water.     In February 2005, the EPA executed an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC)to address problems at Bay Harbor, upon the consent of CMS Land Company (CMSLand) and CMS Capital, LLC, both subsidiaries of CMS Energy. Pursuant to theAOC, the EPA approved a Removal Action Work Plan in July 2005. Among otherthings, this plan calls for the installation of collection trenches to intercepthigh pH CKD leachate flow to the lake. All collection systems contemplated inthis work plan have been installed. Shoreline effectiveness monitoring isongoing, and CMS Land is obligated to address any observed exceedances in pH.This may potentially include the augmentation of the collection system. In May2006, the EPA approved a pilot carbon dioxide augmentation plan to augment theleachate recovery system by improving pH results in the Pine Court area of thecollection system. The augmentation system was installed in June 2006.     In February 2006, CMS Land submitted to the EPA a proposed RemedialInvestigation and Feasibility Study for the East Park CKD pile. The EPA approveda schedule for near-term activities, which include consolidating certain CKDmaterials and installing collection trenches in the East Park leachate releasearea. In June 2006, the EPA approved an East Park CKD Removal Action Work Planand Final Engineering Design for Consolidation. CMS Energy and the MDEQ haveinitiated negotiations of an AOC and to define a long-term remedy at East Park.     The owner of one parcel of land at Bay Harbor has filed a lawsuit in EmmetCounty Circuit Court against CMS Energy and several of its subsidiaries, as wellas Bay Harbor Golf Club Inc., Bay Harbor Company LLC, David C. Johnson, andDavid V. Johnson, one of the developers at Bay Harbor. Several of thesedefendants have demanded indemnification from CMS Energy and affiliates for theclaims made against them in the lawsuit. After a hearing in March 2006 onmotions filed by CMS Energy and other defendants, the judge dismissed variouscounts of the complaint. CMS Energy will defend vigorously the existing case andany other property damage and personal injury claims or lawsuits. In November2006, the judge ruled against a motion to dismiss the remaining counts, and theaction is scheduled to go to trial in May 2007. CMS Land has entered intovarious access, purchase and settlement agreements with several of the affectedlandowners at Bay Harbor. CMS Land has purchased five unimproved lots and twolots with houses. At this time, CMS Land believes it has all necessary accessarrangements to complete the remediation work required under the AOC.     CMS Energy has recorded a cumulative charge of $93 million for itsobligations. An adverse outcome of this matter could, depending on the size ofany indemnification obligation or liability under environmental laws, have apotentially significant adverse effect on CMS Energy's financial condition andliquidity and could negatively impact CMS Energy's financial results. CMS Energycannot predict the ultimate cost or outcome of this matter.     In addition to the litigation and proceedings discussed above, CMS Energyor various of its subsidiaries are parties in other pending litigation in whichsubstantial monetary damages are sought. An adverse outcome in one or more ofthese cases could, depending on the timing and size of any award and theavailability of insurance or reimbursement from third parties, have an adverseeffect on CMS Energy's financial condition, liquidity or future results ofoperations.CMS ENERGY RETAINS CONTINGENT LIABILITIES IN CONNECTION WITH ITS ASSET SALES.     The agreements CMS Energy enters into for the sale of assets customarilyinclude provisions whereby it is required to:     - retain specified preexisting liabilities such as for taxes, pensions, or       environmental conditions;     - indemnify the buyers against specified risks, including the inaccuracy of       representations and warranties it makes; and     - require payments to the buyers depending on the outcome of post-closing       adjustments, litigation, audits or other reviews.                                       27     Many of these contingent liabilities can remain open for extended periodsof time after the sales are closed. Depending on the extent to which the buyersmay ultimately seek to enforce their rights under these contractual provisions,and the resolution of any disputes CMS Energy may have concerning them, theseliabilities could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition,liquidity and future results of operations. See ITEM 7. CMS ENERGY'SMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -- EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW.CMS ENERGY HAS MADE SUBSTANTIAL INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TOPOSSIBLE NATIONALIZATION, EXPROPRIATION OR INABILITY TO CONVERT CURRENCY.     CMS Energy's investments in selected markets around the world in electricgenerating facilities, natural gas pipelines and electric distribution systemsface a number of risks inherent in acquiring, developing and owning these typesof international facilities. Although CMS Energy maintains insurance for variousrisk exposures, including political risk from possible nationalization,expropriation or inability to convert currency, it is exposed to some risks thatinclude local political and economic factors over which it has no control, suchas changes in foreign governmental and regulatory policies (including changes inindustrial regulation and control and changes in taxation), changing politicalconditions and international monetary fluctuations. In some cases an investmentmay have to be abandoned or disposed of at a loss. These factors could have asignificant adverse effect on the financial results of the affected subsidiaryand CMS Energy's financial position and results of operations.     International investments of the type CMS Energy has made are subject tothe risk that the investments may be expropriated or that the requiredagreements, licenses, permits and other approvals may be changed or terminatedin violation of their terms. These kinds of changes could result in a partial ortotal loss of CMS Energy's investment.     The local foreign currency may be devalued, the conversion of the currencymay be restricted or prohibited or other actions, such as increases in taxes,royalties or import duties, may be taken which adversely affect the value andthe recovery of CMS Energy's investment.CMS ENERGY'S NATURAL GAS PIPELINE AND ELECTRIC GENERATION PROJECT LOCATED INARGENTINA AND CHILE MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ARGENTINE GOVERNMENTALRESTRICTIONS PLACED ON NATURAL GAS EXPORTS TO CHILE AND THE EFFECTS OF THESERESTRICTIONS ON THE PROJECT'S CONTRACTS FOR THE SALE OF POWER.     In 2004, the Argentine government authorized the restriction of exports ofnatural gas to Chile, giving priority to domestic demand in Argentina. Thisrestriction had a harmful effect on GasAtacama's earnings since GasAtacama'sgas-fired electric generating plant is located in Chile and uses Argentine gasfor fuel. Bolivia agreed to export 4 million cubic meters of gas per day toArgentina. With the Bolivian gas supply, Argentina relaxed its exportrestrictions to GasAtacama.     In May 2006, the Bolivian government nationalized the natural gas industryand raised prices under its existing gas export contracts. Gas supply toGasAtacama was restricted as Argentina and Bolivia renegotiated the price forgas. In July 2006, Argentina agreed to increase the price it pays for gas fromBolivia. Argentina also announced that it would recover all of this priceincrease by a special tax on its gas exports. This increased the risk and costof GasAtacama's fuel supply.     In August 2006, a major gas supplier notified GasAtacama that it would nolonger deliver gas to GasAtacama under the Argentine government's currentpolicy. In the third quarter of 2006, CMS Energy performed an impairmentanalysis and recorded an impairment charge of $239 million ($169 million, net oftax and minority interest) on its Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). AtDecember 31, 2006, the carrying value of CMS Energy's investment in GasAtacamawas $117 million. This remaining value continues to be exposed to the threat ofa complete gas restriction by Argentina and the inability of GasAtacama to passthrough the increased costs associated with such a restriction to its regulatedcustomers. Therefore, if conditions do not improve, the result could be afurther impairment of CMS Energy's investment in GasAtacama.     In February 2007, CMS Energy announced plans to conduct an auction to sellGasAtacama. CMS Energy expects to complete the sale by the end of 2007.                                       28RISKS RELATED TO CMS ENERGY AND CONSUMERSCMS ENERGY AND CONSUMERS HAVE FINANCING NEEDS AND THEY MAY BE UNABLE TOSUCCESSFULLY ACCESS BANK FINANCING OR THE CAPITAL MARKETS.     Consumers expects to incur significant costs for capital expenditures,including future environmental regulation compliance, especially compliance withclean air laws. See ""CMS Energy and Consumers could incur significant capitalexpenditures to comply with environmental standards and face difficulty inrecovering these costs on a current basis"" below. As of December 31, 2006,Consumers had incurred $688 million in capital expenditures to comply with thefederal Clean Air Act and resulting regulations and anticipate that theremaining $147 million of capital expenditures will be made in 2007 through2011.     CMS Energy and Consumers may be subject to liquidity demands pursuant tocommercial commitments under guarantees, indemnities and letters of credit.Management is actively pursuing plans to sell assets. There can be no assurancesthat this business plan will be successful and failure to achieve its goalscould have a material adverse effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' liquidityand operations.     CMS Energy continues to explore financing opportunities to supplement itsfinancial plan. These potential opportunities include: refinancing its bankcredit facilities, entering into leasing arrangements and refinancing and/orissuing new capital markets debt, preferred stock and/or common equity. CMSEnergy cannot guarantee the capital market's acceptance of its securities orpredict the impact of factors beyond its control, such as actions of ratingagencies. If CMS Energy is unable to access bank financing or the capitalmarkets to incur or refinance indebtedness, there could be a material adverseeffect upon its liquidity and operations.     Similarly, Consumers currently plans to seek funds through the capitalmarkets and commercial lenders. Entering into new financings is subject in partto capital market receptivity to utility industry securities in general and toConsumers' securities issuances in particular. Consumers cannot guarantee thecapital market's acceptance of its securities or predict the impact of factorsbeyond its control, such as actions of rating agencies. If Consumers is unableto access bank financing or the capital markets to incur or refinanceindebtedness, there could be a material adverse effect upon its liquidity andoperations.     Certain of CMS Energy's securities and those of its affiliates, includingConsumers, are rated by various credit rating agencies. Any reduction orwithdrawal of one or more of its credit ratings could have a material adverseimpact on CMS Energy's ability to access capital on acceptable terms andmaintain commodity lines of credit and could make its cost of borrowing higher.If it is unable to maintain commodity lines of credit, CMS Energy may have topost collateral or make prepayments to certain of its suppliers pursuant toexisting contracts with them. Further, any adverse developments to Consumers,which provides dividends to CMS Energy, that result in a lowering of Consumers'credit ratings could have an adverse effect on CMS Energy's credit ratings. CMSEnergy and Consumers cannot guarantee that any of their current ratings willremain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not belowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency.PERIODIC REVIEWS OF THE VALUES OF CMS ENERGY'S AND CONSUMERS' ASSETS COULDRESULT IN ACCOUNTING CHARGES.     CMS Energy and Consumers are required by GAAP to periodically review thecarrying value of their assets, including those that may be sold. Marketconditions, the operational characteristics of their assets and other factorscould result in recording additional impairment charges for their assets, whichcould have an adverse effect on their stockholders' equity and their access toadditional financing. In addition, they may be required to record impairmentcharges and/or foreign currency translation losses at the time they sell assets,depending on the sale prices they are able to secure and other factors.CMS ENERGY AND CONSUMERS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONSREGARDING ""ROUND-TRIP"" TRADING BY CMS MST AS WELL AS CIVIL LAWSUITS REGARDINGPRICING INFORMATION THAT CMS MST AND CMS FIELD SERVICES PROVIDED TO MARKETPUBLICATIONS.     As a result of round-trip trading transactions (simultaneous, prearrangedcommodity trading transactions in which energy commodities were sold andrepurchased at the same price) at CMS MST, CMS Energy is under                                       29investigation by the DOJ. CMS Energy received subpoenas in 2002 and 2003 fromU.S. Attorneys' Offices regarding investigations of those trades. CMS Energyresponded to those subpoenas in 2003 and 2004.     In March 2004, the SEC approved a cease-and-desist order settling anadministrative action against CMS Energy relating to round-trip trading. Theorder did not assess a fine and CMS Energy neither admitted nor denied theorder's findings.     CMS Energy has notified appropriate regulatory and governmental agenciesthat some employees at CMS MST and CMS Field Services appeared to have providedinaccurate information regarding natural gas trades to various energy industrypublications which compile and report index prices. CMS Energy is cooperatingwith an ongoing investigation by the DOJ regarding this matter. CMS Energy isunable to predict the outcome of the DOJ investigation and what effect, if any,the investigation will have on CMS Energy. The CFTC filed a civil injunctiveaction against two former CMS Field Services employees in Oklahoma federaldistrict court on February 1, 2005. The action alleges the two engaged inreporting false natural gas trade information, and seeks to enjoin such acts,compel compliance with the Commodities Exchange Act, and impose monetarypenalties. A trial has been set for April 2007. CMS Energy is currentlyadvancing legal defense costs to the two individuals in accordance with existingindemnification policies.     CMS Energy, CMS MST, CMS Field Services, Cantera Natural Gas, Inc. (thecompany that purchased CMS Field Services) and Cantera Gas Company are named asdefendants in various lawsuits arising as a result of claimed inaccurate naturalgas price reporting. Allegations include manipulation of NYMEX natural gasfutures and options prices, price-fixing conspiracies, and artificial inflationof natural gas retail prices in California, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri,Tennessee, and Wyoming. In September 2006, CMS MST reached an agreement inprinciple to settle the master class action suit in California for $7 million.The settlement agreement has been signed. The settlement payment is not dueuntil the court has approved the settlement. CMS Energy deemed this settlementto be probable and accrued the payment in its consolidated financial statementsat September 30, 2006. CMS Energy and the other CMS Energy defendants willdefend themselves vigorously against all of these matters but cannot predicttheir outcome.     CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the outcome of the DOJinvestigations and the lawsuits. It is possible that the outcome in one or moreof the investigations or the lawsuits could adversely affect CMS Energy's andConsumers' financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.REGULATORY CHANGES AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS HAVE RESULTED AND COULD CONTINUE TORESULT IN INCREASED COMPETITION IN THE DOMESTIC ENERGY BUSINESS. GENERALLY,INCREASED COMPETITION THREATENS MARKET SHARE IN CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF CMS ENERGY'SBUSINESS AND CAN REDUCE ITS AND CONSUMERS' PROFITABILITY.     Pursuant to the Customer Choice Act, as of January 1, 2002, all electriccustomers in Michigan have the choice of buying electric generation service fromConsumers or an alternative electric supplier. Consumers had experienced, andcould experience in the future, a significant increase in competition forgeneration services due to ROA. At December 31, 2006, alternative electricsuppliers were providing 300 MW of generation service to ROA customers. Thisamount represents 3 percent of Consumers' total distribution load. It isdifficult to predict the total amount of electric supply load that may be lostto competitor suppliers in the future.ELECTRIC INDUSTRY REGULATION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CMS ENERGY'S AND CONSUMERS'BUSINESS, INCLUDING THEIR ABILITY TO RECOVER COSTS FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS.     Federal and state regulation of electric utilities has changed dramaticallyin the last two decades and could continue to change over the next severalyears. These changes could adversely affect CMS Energy's and Consumers'business, financial condition and profitability.     There are multiple proceedings pending before the FERC involvingtransmission rates, regional transmission organizations and electric bulk powermarkets and transmission. FERC is also reviewing the standards under whichelectric utilities are allowed to participate in wholesale power markets withoutprice restrictions. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the impact of theseelectric industry restructuring proceedings on their financial position,liquidity or results of operations.                                       30CMS ENERGY AND CONSUMERS COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO COMPLYWITH ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS AND FACE DIFFICULTY IN RECOVERING THESE COSTS ON ACURRENT BASIS.     CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to costly andincreasingly stringent environmental regulations. They expect that the cost offuture environmental compliance, especially compliance with clean air and waterlaws, will be significant.     In 1998, the EPA issued regulations requiring the State of Michigan tofurther limit nitrogen oxide emissions at coal-fired electric generating plants.The EPA and State of Michigan regulations require Consumers to make significantcapital expenditures estimated to be $835 million. As of December 2006,Consumers has incurred $688 million in capital expenditures to comply with theseregulations and anticipates that the remaining $147 million of capitalexpenditures will be made in 2007 through 2011. In addition to modifying coal-fired electric plants, Consumers' compliance plan includes the use of nitrogenoxide emission allowances until all of the control equipment is operational in2011. The nitrogen oxide emission allowance annual expense is projected to be $3million per year, which Consumers expects to recover from customers through thePSCR process.     In 2005, the EPA adopted the Clean Air Interstate Rule that requiresadditional coal-fired electric plant emission controls for nitrogen oxides andsulfur dioxide. Consumers plans to meet this rule by year-round operation of itsselective catalytic reduction control technology units and installation of fluegas desulfurization scrubbers at an estimated total cost of $955 million, to beincurred by 2014.     Also in March 2005, the EPA issued the Clean Air Mercury Rule, whichrequires initial reductions of mercury emissions from coal-fired electricgenerating plants by 2010 and further reductions by 2018. Based on currenttechnology, Consumers anticipates that its capital costs for mercury emissionsreductions required by Phase I of the Clean Air Mercury Rule to be less than $50million and expect these reductions to be implemented by 2010. Phase IIrequirements of the Clean Air Mercury Rule are not yet known and a cost estimatehas not been determined.     In April 2006, Michigan's governor announced a plan that would result inmercury emissions reductions of 90 percent by 2015. Consumers is working withthe MDEQ on the details of these rules. We will develop a cost estimate when thedetails of these rules are determined.     Several legislative proposals have been introduced in the United StatesCongress that would require reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases,including potentially carbon dioxide. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predictwhether any of these proposals will be enacted, or the specific requirements ofany of these proposals and their effect on future operations and financialresults. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case claimingthat the EPA is required by the Clean Air Act to consider regulating carbondioxide emissions from automobiles. The EPA asserts that it lacks authority toregulate carbon dioxide emissions. If the Supreme Court finds that the EPA hasthe authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions in this case, it could resultin new federal carbon dioxide regulations for other industries, including theutility industry.     To the extent that greenhouse gas emission reduction rules come intoeffect, the mandatory emissions reduction requirements could have far-reachingand significant implications for the energy sector. CMS Energy and Consumerscannot estimate the potential effect of federal or state level greenhouse gaspolicy on their future consolidated results of operations, cash flows, orfinancial position due to the uncertain nature of the policies at this time.However, CMS Energy and Consumers will continue to monitor greenhouse gas policydevelopments and assess and respond to their potential implications on theirbusiness operations.     In March 2004, the EPA issued rules that govern electric generating plantcooling water intake systems. The rules require significant reduction in fishkilled by operating equipment. EPA compliance options in the rule werechallenged in court. In January 2007, the court rejected many of the complianceoptions favored by industry and remanded the bulk of the rule back to the EPAfor reconsideration. The court's ruling is expected to increase significantlythe cost of complying with this rule. However, the cost to comply will not beknown until the EPA's reconsideration is complete. At this time, the EPA has notestablished a schedule to address the court decision.     CMS Energy expects to collect fully from its customers, through theratemaking process, these and other required environmental expenditures.However, if these expenditures are not recovered from customers in                                       31Consumers' rates, CMS Energy and/or Consumers may be required to seeksignificant additional financing to fund these expenditures, which could straintheir cash resources.CMS ENERGY'S AND CONSUMERS' REVENUES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TORISKS THAT ARE BEYOND THEIR CONTROL, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO FUTURETERRORIST ATTACKS OR RELATED ACTS OF WAR.     The cost of repairing damage to CMS Energy's and Consumers' facilities dueto storms, natural disasters, wars, terrorist acts and other catastrophicevents, in excess of insurance recoveries and reserves established for theserepairs, may adversely impact their results of operations, financial conditionand cash flows. The occurrence or risk of occurrence of future terroristactivity and the high cost or potential unavailability of insurance to coverthis terrorist activity may impact their results of operations and financialcondition in unpredictable ways. These actions could also result in disruptionsof power and fuel markets. In addition, their natural gas distribution systemand pipelines could be directly or indirectly harmed by future terroristactivity.CONSUMERS' OWNERSHIP OF A NUCLEAR GENERATING FACILITY CREATES RISK RELATING TONUCLEAR ENERGY.     Consumers owns the Palisades nuclear power plant and is, therefore, subjectto the risks of nuclear generation, including the risks associated with theoperation of plant facilities and the storage and disposal of spent fuel andother radioactive waste. The NRC has broad authority under federal law to imposelicensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nucleargeneration facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authorityto impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment ofthe severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. In addition, if aserious nuclear incident were to occur at Consumers' plant, it could harmConsumers' results of operations and financial condition. A major incident at anuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibitthe operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.     In July 2006, Consumers reached an agreement to sell the Palisades nuclearplant to Entergy for $380 million. Consumers also signed a 15-year powerpurchase agreement for 100 percent of the plant's current electric output.Consumers expects to close the sale in 2007. The sale will result in animmediate reduction in nuclear operating and decommissioning risk.CONSUMERS CURRENTLY UNDERRECOVERS IN ITS RATES ITS PAYMENTS TO THE MCVPARTNERSHIP FOR CAPACITY AND ENERGY.     The MCV Partnership, which leases and operates the MCV Facility, contractedto sell electricity to Consumers for a 35-year period beginning in 1990.     The cost that we incur under the MCV PPA exceeds the recovery amountallowed by the MPSC. We expensed underrecoveries of $57 million in 2006 and weestimate cash underrecoveries of $39 million in 2007. However, we use the directsavings from the RCP, after allocating a portion to customers, to offset aportion of our capacity and fixed energy underrecoveries expense.     After September 15, 2007, we expect to claim relief under the regulatoryout provision in the MCV PPA, thereby limiting our capacity and fixed energypayments to the MCV Partnership to the amounts that we collect from ourcustomers. The MCV Partnership has notified us that it takes issue with ourintended exercise of the regulatory out provision. We believe that the provisionis valid and fully effective, but cannot assure that it will prevail in theevent of a dispute. If we are successful in exercising the regulatory outprovision, the MCV Partnership has the right to terminate the MCV PPA, whichcould affect our reserve margin. We anticipate that the MPSC will review ourexercise of the regulatory out provision and the likely consequences of suchaction in 2007. It is possible that in the event that the MCV Partnership ceasesperformance under the MCV PPA, prior orders could limit our recovery ofreplacement power costs to the amounts that the MPSC authorized for recoveryunder the MCV PPA. Depending on the cost of replacement power, this could resultin our costs exceeding the recovery amount allowed by the MPSC. We cannotpredict the outcome of any future disputes concerning these issues.     In January 2005, we implemented the MPSC-approved RCP with modifications.The underlying RCP agreement between Consumers and the MCV Partnership extendsthrough the term of the MCV PPA. However, either party may terminate thatagreement under certain conditions. In January 2007, the Michigan                                       32Attorney General filed an appeal with the Michigan Supreme Court regarding theMPSC's order approving the RCP. We cannot predict the outcome of these matters.     At this time CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the impact of theseissues on their future earnings or cash flows.CONSUMERS' ENERGY RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN MANAGINGFUEL AND ELECTRICITY PRICING RISKS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN UNANTICIPATEDLIABILITIES TO CONSUMERS OR INCREASED VOLATILITY OF ITS EARNINGS.     Consumers is exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas, coal,electricity and emission credits. Prices for natural gas, coal, electricity andemission credits may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods oftime and expose Consumers to commodity price risk. A substantial portion ofConsumers' operating expenses for its plants consists of the costs of obtainingthese commodities. Consumers manages these risks using established policies andprocedures, and it may use various contracts to manage these risks, includingswaps, options, futures and forward contracts. No assurance can be made thatthese strategies will be successful in managing Consumers' pricing risk, or thatthey will not result in net liabilities to Consumers as a result of futurevolatility in these markets.     Natural gas prices in particular have historically been volatile. Consumersroutinely enters into contracts to offset its positions, such as hedgingexposure to the risks of demand, market effects of weather and changes incommodity prices associated with its gas distribution business. These positionsare taken in conjunction with the GCR mechanism, which allows Consumers torecover prudently incurred costs associated with those positions. However,Consumers does not always hedge the entire exposure of its operations fromcommodity price volatility. Furthermore, the ability to hedge exposure tocommodity price volatility depends on liquid commodity markets. As a result, tothe extent the commodity markets are illiquid, Consumers may not be able toexecute its risk management strategies, which could result in greater openpositions than preferred at a given time. To the extent that open positionsexist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish CMS Energy's andConsumers' financial results and financial position"
1,CMS,CMS ENERGY CORP,2006-02-24,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSRISKS RELATED TO CMS ENERGYCMS ENERGY DEPENDS ON DIVIDENDS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO MEET ITS DEBT SERVICEOBLIGATIONS.     Due to its holding company structure, CMS Energy depends on dividends fromits subsidiaries to meet its debt obligations. Restrictions contained inConsumers' preferred stock provisions and other legal restrictions, such ascertain terms in its articles of incorporation, limit Consumers' ability to paydividends or acquire its own stock from CMS Energy. As of December 31, 2005, themost restrictive provisions in its financing documents allowed Consumers to payan aggregate of $300 million in dividends to CMS Energy during any year. AtDecember 31, 2005 Consumers had $179 million of unrestricted retained earningsavailable to pay common stock dividends. If sufficient dividends are not paid toCMS Energy by its subsidiaries, CMS Energy may not be able to generate the fundsnecessary to fulfill its cash obligations, thereby adversely affecting itsliquidity and financial condition.CMS ENERGY HAS SUBSTANTIAL INDEBTEDNESS THAT COULD LIMIT ITS FINANCIALFLEXIBILITY AND HENCE ITS ABILITY TO MEET ITS DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS.     As of December 31, 2005, CMS Energy had outstanding approximately $2.527billion aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, including approximately $178million of subordinated indebtedness relating to its convertible preferredsecurities but excluding approximately $4.888 billion of indebtedness of itssubsidiaries. In May 2005, CMS Energy entered into the Sixth Amended andRestated Credit Agreement in the amount of approximately $300 million. As ofDecember 31, 2005, there were approximately $96 million of letters of creditoutstanding under the Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. CMS Energyand its subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future.     The level of CMS Energy's present and future indebtedness could haveseveral important effects on its future operations, including, among others:     - a significant portion of its cash flow from operations will be dedicated       to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness and will not       be available for other purposes;     - covenants contained in its existing debt arrangements require it to meet       certain financial tests, which may affect its flexibility in planning       for, and reacting to, changes in its business;     - its ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital       expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes may       be limited;     - it may be at a competitive disadvantage to its competitors that are less       leveraged; and     - its vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions may       increase.     CMS Energy's ability to meet its debt service obligations and to reduce itstotal indebtedness will be dependent upon its future performance, which will besubject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, businessand other factors affecting its operations, many of which are beyond itscontrol. CMS Energy cannot assure you that its business will continue togenerate sufficient cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness. If itis unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, it may be requiredto sell additional assets or obtain additional financings. CMS Energy cannotassure that additional financing will be available on commercially acceptableterms or at all.     There can be no assurance that the requirements of CMS Energy's existingdebt arrangements or other indebtedness will be met in the future. Failure tocomply with those covenants may result in a default with respect to the relateddebt and could lead to acceleration of that debt or any instruments evidencingindebtedness that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions.     In such a case, there can be no assurance that CMS Energy would be able torefinance or otherwise repay that indebtedness.                                        26CMS ENERGY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF CLAIMS REGARDING ITS PARTICIPATION INTHE DEVELOPMENT OF BAY HARBOR OR OTHER LITIGATION IN WHICH SUBSTANTIAL MONETARYCLAIMS ARE INVOLVED.     As part of the development of Bay Harbor by certain subsidiaries of CMSEnergy, which went forward under an agreement with the MDEQ, a third partyconstructed a golf course over several abandoned cement kiln dust (CKD) piles,left over from the former cement plant operation on the Bay Harbor site.Pursuant to the agreement with the MDEQ, CMS Energy constructed a watercollection system to recover seep water from one of the CKD piles. In 2002, CMSEnergy sold its interest in Bay Harbor, but retained its obligations underprevious environmental indemnifications entered into at the inception of theproject.     In September 2004, the MDEQ issued a notice of noncompliance (NON), afterfinding high-pH seep water in Lake Michigan adjacent to the property. The MDEQalso found higher than acceptable levels of heavy metals, including mercury, inthe seep water.     In February 2005, the EPA executed an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC)to address problems at Bay Harbor, upon the consent of CMS Land Company, asubsidiary of Enterprises and CMS Capital, LLC, a subsidiary of CMS Energy.Under the AOC, CMS Land Company and CMS Capital, LLC are generally obligated,among other things, to: (i) engage in measures to restrict access to seep areas,install methods to interrupt the flow of seep water to Lake Michigan, and takeother measures as may be required by the EPA under an approved ""removal actionwork plan""; (ii) investigate and study the extent of hazardous substances at thesite, evaluate alternatives to address a long-term remedy, and issue a report ofthe investigation and study; and (iii) within 120 days after EPA approval of theinvestigation report, enter into an enforceable agreement with the MDEQ toaddress a long-term remedy under certain criteria set forth in the AOC. The EPAapproved a final removal action work plan in September 2005.     The EPA-approved removal action work plan provides for fencing of affectedbeachfront areas and installing an underground leachate collection system, amongother elements. The EPA's approvals also specify that a backup ""containment andisolation system,"" involving dams or barriers in the lake, could be required incertain areas, if the collection system is ineffective. In addition, there areindications that CKD may be located on the beach at the west end of thecollection system installation. As a result, construction in the affected areahas been halted pending further investigation. CMS Energy has worked out aschedule with the EPA to perform further investigation of these conditions andwill deliver a conceptual design to the EPA for a remediation system. CMS Energyis presently engaged in negotiations with the EPA and the MDEQ concerningpotential interim remediation activities for the Eastern CKD pile, which mayinclude a carbon dioxide injection system to neutralize high-pH materials and/ora collection system or systems.     Several parties have issued demand letters to CMS Energy claiming breach ofthe indemnification provisions, making requests for payment of their expensesrelated to the NON, and/or claiming damages to property or personal injury withregard to the matter. Several landowners have threatened litigation in the eventtheir demands are not met and owners of one parcel have filed a lawsuit in EmmetCounty Circuit Court against CMS Energy and several of its subsidiaries, as wellas Bay Harbor Company LLC and David Johnson, one of the developers at BayHarbor. CMS Energy responded to the indemnification claims by stating that ithad not breached its indemnity obligations, it will comply with the indemnities,it has restarted the seep water collection facility and it has responded to theNON. CMS Energy has entered into various access, purchase and settlementagreements with several of the affected landowners at Bay Harbor and continuesnegotiations with other landowners for access as necessary to implementremediation measures. CMS Energy will defend vigorously any property damage andpersonal injury claims or lawsuits.     CMS Energy originally recorded a liability for its obligations associatedwith this matter in the amount of $45 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.Under the AOC, CMS Land Company is presently conducting a remedial investigationof the site, which includes the gathering and analysis of data to be utilized inarriving at a permanent fix. Based on the evaluation of recent constructionevents and site-related data, CMS Energy has increased its cost projections andreserves to $85 million. An adverse outcome of this matter could, depending onthe size of any indemnification obligation or liability under environmentallaws, have a potentially significant adverse effect on CMS Energy's financialcondition and liquidity and could negatively impact CMS Energy's financialresults. CMS Energy cannot predict the ultimate cost or outcome of this matter.                                        27     In addition to the litigation and proceedings discussed above, CMS Energyor various of its subsidiaries are parties in other pending litigation in whichsubstantial monetary damages are sought. An adverse outcome in one or more ofthese cases could, depending on the timing and size of any award and theavailability of insurance or reimbursement from third parties, have an adverseeffect on CMS Energy's financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.CMS ENERGY RETAINS CONTINGENT LIABILITIES IN CONNECTION WITH ITS ASSET SALES.     The agreements CMS Energy enters into for the sale of assets customarilyinclude provisions whereby it is required to:     - retain specified preexisting liabilities such as for taxes and pensions;     - indemnify the buyers against specified risks, including the inaccuracy of       representations and warranties it makes; and     - require payments to the buyers depending on the outcome of post-closing       adjustments, audits or other reviews.     Many of these contingent liabilities can remain open for extended periodsof time after the sales are closed. Depending on the extent to which the buyersmay ultimately seek to enforce their rights under these contractual provisions,and the resolution of any disputes CMS Energy may have concerning them, theseliabilities could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition,liquidity and results of operations.     CMS Energy has received a request for indemnification from the purchaser ofCMS Oil and Gas. The indemnification claim relates to the sale by CMS Energy ofits oil, gas and methanol projects in Equatorial Guinea and the claim of thegovernment of Equatorial Guinea that $142 million in taxes is owed it inconnection with that sale. Based on information currently available, CMS Energyand its tax advisors have concluded that the government's tax claim is withoutmerit and the purchaser of CMS Oil and Gas has submitted a response to thegovernment rejecting the claim. An adverse outcome of this claim could have amaterial adverse effect on CMS Energy's financial condition, liquidity andresults of operations.CMS ENERGY HAS MADE SUBSTANTIAL INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TOPOSSIBLE NATIONALIZATION, EXPROPRIATION OR INABILITY TO CONVERT CURRENCY.     CMS Energy's investments in selected international markets in electricgenerating facilities, natural gas pipelines and electric distribution systemsface a number of risks inherent in acquiring, developing and owning these typesof international facilities. Although CMS Energy maintains insurance for variousrisk exposures, including political risk from possible nationalization,expropriation or inability to convert currency, it is exposed to some risks thatinclude local political and economic factors over which it has no control, suchas changes in foreign governmental and regulatory policies (including changes inindustrial regulation and control and changes in taxation), changing politicalconditions and international monetary fluctuations. In some cases an investmentmay have to be abandoned or disposed of at a loss. These factors could have asignificant adverse effect on the financial results of the affected subsidiaryand CMS Energy's financial position and results of operations.     International investments of the type CMS Energy has made are subject tothe risk that the investments may be expropriated or that the requiredagreements, licenses, permits and other approvals may be changed or terminatedin violation of their terms. These kinds of changes could result in a partial ortotal loss of CMS Energy's investment.     The local foreign currency may be devalued, the conversion of the currencymay be restricted or prohibited or other actions, such as increases in taxes,royalties or import duties, may be taken which adversely affect the value andthe recovery of CMS Energy's investment.                                        28RISKS RELATED TO CMS ENERGY AND CONSUMERSCMS ENERGY AND CONSUMERS HAVE FINANCING NEEDS AND THEY MAY BE UNABLE TOSUCCESSFULLY ACCESS BANK FINANCING OR THE CAPITAL MARKETS.     Consumers expects to incur significant costs for capital expenditures,including future environmental regulation compliance, especially compliance withclean air laws. See ""CMS Energy and Consumers could incur significant capitalexpenditures to comply with environmental standards and face difficulty inrecovering these costs on a current basis"" below. As of December 31, 2005,Consumers had incurred $605 million in capital expenditures to comply with theseregulations and future capital expenditures may total approximately $210 millionbetween 2006 and 2011.     CMS Energy and Consumers continue to be challenged by the substantialincrease in natural gas prices. Although Consumers' reasonably and prudentlyincurred natural gas purchases are recoverable from its utility customers, asgas prices increase, the amount it pays for natural gas stored as inventory willrequire additional liquidity due to the timing of the cost recoveries from itscustomers. Consumers anticipates that it will need a substantial amount of cashin the summer of 2006 to purchase storage for natural gas for winter 2006-2007.See ""The combined effects of substantially higher natural gas prices,restrictions on Consumers' ability to issue first mortgage bonds and possiblepower purchase supply cost recovery delays may have a negative effect onConsumers' short-term liquidity"" below. CMS Energy and Consumers could also berequired to make additional cash contributions to their employee pension andbenefit plans and become subject to liquidity demands pursuant to commercialcommitments under guarantees, indemnities and letters of credit. Management isactively pursuing plans to sell assets. There can be no assurances that thisbusiness plan will be successful and failure to achieve its goals could have amaterial adverse effect on CMS Energy's and Consumers' liquidity and operations.     CMS Energy continues to explore financing opportunities to supplement itsfinancial plan. These potential opportunities include: refinancing its bankcredit facilities, entering into leasing arrangements and refinancing and/orissuing new capital markets debt, preferred stock and/or common equity. CMSEnergy cannot guarantee the capital market's acceptance of its securities orpredict the impact of factors beyond its control, such as actions of ratingagencies. If CMS Energy is unable to access bank financing or the capitalmarkets to incur or refinance indebtedness, there could be a material adverseeffect upon its liquidity and operations.     Similarly, Consumers currently plans to seek funds through the capitalmarkets and commercial lenders. Entering into new financings is subject in partto capital market receptivity to utility industry securities in general and toConsumers' securities issuances in particular. Consumers cannot guarantee thecapital market's acceptance of its securities or predict the impact of factorsbeyond its control, such as actions of rating agencies. If Consumers is unableto access bank financing or the capital markets to incur or refinanceindebtedness, there could be a material adverse effect upon its liquidity andoperations.     Certain of CMS Energy's securities and those of its affiliates, includingConsumers, are rated by various credit rating agencies. Any reduction orwithdrawal of one or more of its credit ratings could have a material adverseimpact on CMS Energy's ability to access capital on acceptable terms andmaintain commodity lines of credit and could make its cost of borrowing higher.If it is unable to maintain commodity lines of credit, CMS Energy may have topost collateral or make prepayments to certain of its suppliers pursuant toexisting contracts with them. Further, any adverse developments to Consumers,which provides dividends to CMS Energy, that result in a lowering of Consumers'credit ratings could have an adverse effect on CMS Energy's credit ratings. CMSEnergy and Consumers cannot assure you that any of their current ratings willremain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not belowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency.     On August 2, 2005, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 2005-53 and regulations toprovide guidance with respect to the use of the ""simplified service cost"" methodof tax accounting. CMS Energy and Consumers use this tax accounting method,generally allowed by the IRS under section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code,with respect to the allocation of certain corporate overheads to the tax basisof self-constructed utility assets. Under the IRS guidance, significant issueswith respect to the application of this method remain unresolved and subject todispute. However, the effect of the IRS's position may be to require CMS Energyeither (1) to repay a portion of previously received tax benefits, or (2) to addback to taxable income, half in each of 2005 and 2006, a significant                                        29portion of previously deducted overheads. The impact of this matter on futureearnings, cash flows, or present NOL carryforwards remains uncertain, but couldbe material. CMS Energy and Consumers have recorded a reduction in NOLcarryforwards of $359 million in 2005, and a corresponding reduction in deferredtaxes related to property, to reflect the estimated 2005 effect of the newregulation. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the outcome of this matter.PERIODIC REVIEWS OF THE VALUES OF CMS ENERGY'S AND CONSUMERS' ASSETS COULDRESULT IN ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTING CHARGES SUCH AS THE RECENT ASSET IMPAIRMENTCHARGES THEY TOOK RELATING TO THEIR INTEREST IN THE MCV PARTNERSHIP.     CMS Energy and Consumers are required by GAAP to periodically review thecarrying value of their assets, including those that may be sold. Marketconditions, the operational characteristics of their assets and other factorscould result in recording additional impairment charges for their assets, whichcould have an adverse effect on their stockholders' equity and their access toadditional financing. In addition, they may be required to record impairmentcharges and/or foreign currency translation losses at the time they sell assets,depending on the sale prices they are able to secure and other factors.     The MCV Partnership's costs of producing electricity are tied to the priceof natural gas, but its revenues do not vary with changes in the price ofnatural gas. In 2005, NYMEX forward natural gas price forecasts for the years2005 through 2010 increased substantially. Additionally, other independentnatural gas long-term forward price forecasting organizations indicated theirintention to raise their forecasts for the price of natural gas generally overthe entire long-term forecast horizon beyond 2010. CMS Energy's and Consumers'analysis and assessment of this information suggested that forward natural gasprices for the period from 2006 through 2010 could average approximately $9 permcf. Further, this information indicated that natural gas prices could averageapproximately $6.50 per mcf over the long term beyond 2010. As a result, in2005, the MCV Partnership reevaluated the economics of operating the MCVFacility and determined that an impairment analysis, considering revised forwardnatural gas price assumptions, was required. In its impairment analysis, the MCVPartnership determined the fair value of its fixed assets by discounting a setof probability-weighted streams of future operating cash flows at a 4.3 percentrisk free interest rate. The carrying value of the MCV Partnership's fixedassets exceeded the estimated fair value, resulting in an impairment charge of$1.159 billion to recognize the reduction in fair value of the MCV Facility'sfixed assets. As a result, Consumers' 2005 net income was reduced by $369million after considering tax effects and minority interest. The MCVPartnership's fixed assets, which are included on Consumers' ConsolidatedBalance Sheets and reported by CMS Energy under the Enterprises businesssegment, after reflecting the impairment charge, are valued at $224 million atDecember 31, 2005.     The impairment of the MCV Facility, and any potential future impairment ofthe MCV Facility, will likely decrease the amount of equity investmentrecognized in future electric and gas rate orders. Lower equity investment mayresult in a reduced revenue requirement. However, CMS Energy and Consumerscannot predict the outcome of any future rate cases, which may be lower orhigher based on several factors, including the amount of equity investment andrelated risk.     If natural gas prices remain at present levels or increase, the operationsof the MCV Facility would be adversely affected and could result in the MCVPartnership failing to meet its obligations under the sale and leasebacktransactions and other contracts and could result in a potential impairment ofthe FMLP. At December 31, 2005, Consumers' investment in the FMLP was $235million.     Consumers' 49 percent interest in the MCV Partnership is held throughConsumers' wholly-owned subsidiary, CMS Midland. The severe adverse change inthe anticipated economics of the MCV Partnership operations discussed hereinalso led to the decision to impair certain assets carried on the balance sheetof CMS Midland. These assets represented interest capitalized during theconstruction of the MCV Facility, which were being amortized over the life ofthe MCV Facility. In the third quarter of 2005, Consumers recorded an impairmentcharge of $25 million ($16 million, net of tax) to reduce the carrying amount ofthese assets to zero.     The total of the CMS Midland impairment and the MCV Partnership impairmentdiscussed above is $1.184 billion, before tax, and $385 million net of taxes andminority interest.                                        30THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER NATURAL GAS PRICES, RESTRICTIONS ONCONSUMERS' ABILITY TO ISSUE FIRST MORTGAGE BONDS AND POSSIBLE POWER PURCHASESUPPLY COST RECOVERY DELAYS MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON CONSUMERS' SHORT-TERMLIQUIDITY.     Natural gas prices continue to increase substantially. Although Consumers'natural gas purchases are recoverable from its utility customers, as gas pricesincrease, the amount it pays for natural gas stored as inventory will requireadditional liquidity due to the timing of the cost recoveries from itscustomers. Due to the high natural gas prices, Consumers' ability to collectaccounts receivable from its gas customers may be negatively impacted. Inaddition, if natural gas prices increase or stay at current levels, Consumerswill require significant additional liquidity in the summer of 2006 to fill itsgas storage facilities in preparation for the 2006-2007 heating season.     Due to the adverse impact of the MCV Partnership asset impairment chargerecorded in September 2005, Consumers' ability to issue FMB as primaryobligations or as collateral for financing is expected to be limited to $298million through September 30, 2006. FMB have been a primary source of financingfor Consumers. After September 30, 2006, Consumers' ability to issue FMB inexcess of $298 million is based on achieving a two-times FMB interest coverageratio.     Consumers is entitled to recover its reasonably and prudently incurredpower supply costs pursuant to the PSCR process. In September 2005, Consumerssubmitted its 2006 PSCR plan filing to the MPSC. In November 2005, it submittedan amended 2006 PSCR plan to the MPSC to include higher estimates for certaintransmission and coal supply costs. In December 2005, the MPSC issued an orderthat temporarily excludes the increased portion of these costs from Consumers'PSCR charge, which began in January 2006. The order also includes a one mill perkWh reduction in the PSCR charge. To the extent that Consumers incurs and isunable to collect these costs in a timely manner, its cash flows from electricutility operations will be affected negatively. Consumers cannot predict theoutcome of the PSCR proceeding.CMS ENERGY AND CONSUMERS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONSAND A LAWSUIT REGARDING ""ROUND-TRIP"" TRADING BY CMS MST AS WELL AS CIVILLAWSUITS REGARDING PRICING INFORMATION THAT CMS MST AND CMS FIELD SERVICESPROVIDED TO MARKET PUBLICATIONS.     As a result of round-trip trading transactions (simultaneous, prearrangedcommodity trading transactions in which energy commodities were sold andrepurchased at the same price) at CMS MST, CMS Energy is under investigation bythe DOJ. CMS Energy has also received subpoenas from U.S. Attorneys' Officesregarding investigations of those trades. In addition, CMS Energy, Consumers andcertain officers and directors of CMS Energy and its affiliates, have been namedin numerous securities class action lawsuits by individuals who allege that theypurchased CMS Energy securities during a purported class period. The cases havebeen consolidated into a single lawsuit. The consolidated lawsuit generallyseeks unspecified damages based on allegations that the defendants violatedUnited States securities laws and regulations by making allegedly false andmisleading statements about CMS Energy's business and financial condition,particularly with respect to revenues and expenses recorded in connection withround-trip trading by CMS MST. In January 2005, a motion was granted dismissingConsumers and three of the individual defendants, but the court denied themotions to dismiss for CMS Energy and the 13 remaining individual defendants.Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on April 15, 2005 and anamended motion for class certification on June 20, 2005. On November 29, 2005,the court denied a further motion to dismiss filed by CMS Energy and denied amotion by the plaintiffs for partial summary judgment.     In March 2004, the SEC approved a cease-and-desist order settling anadministrative action against CMS Energy relating to round-trip trading. Theorder did not assess a fine and CMS Energy neither admitted nor denied theorder's findings.     CMS Energy has notified appropriate regulatory and governmental agenciesthat some employees at CMS MST and CMS Field Services (now Cantera Gas Company)appeared to have provided inaccurate information regarding natural gas trades tovarious energy industry publications which compile and report index prices. CMSEnergy is cooperating with an ongoing investigation by the DOJ regarding thismatter. On November 25, 2003, the CFTC issued a settlement order regarding thismatter. CMS MST and CMS Field Services agreed to pay a                                        31fine to the CFTC totaling $16 million. CMS Energy neither admitted nor deniedthe findings of the CFTC in the settlement order. The CFTC filed a civilinjunctive action against two former CMS Field Services employees in Oklahomafederal district court on February 1, 2005. The action alleges the two engagedin reporting false natural gas trade information, and the action seeks to enjointhose acts, compel compliance with the Commodities Exchange Act and imposemonetary penalties. CMS Energy is currently advancing legal defense costs to thetwo individuals in accordance with existing indemnification policies.     CMS Energy has also been named as a defendant in a number of gas industrycivil lawsuits regarding inaccurate gas trade reporting that include claimsalleging manipulation of NYMEX natural gas futures and options prices,price-fixing conspiracies and artificial inflation of natural gas retail pricesin California, Kansas and Tennessee.     CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the outcome of the DOJinvestigations and the lawsuits. It is possible that the outcome in one or moreof the investigations or the lawsuits could adversely affect CMS Energy's andConsumers' financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.CMS ENERGY AND CONSUMERS MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE RESULTS OF ANEMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN LAWSUIT.     CMS Energy and Consumers are defendants, along with CMS MST and certainnamed and unnamed officers and directors, in two lawsuits brought as purportedclass actions on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of their 401(k) plan.The two cases, filed in July 2002 in the United States District Court for theEastern District of Michigan, were consolidated by the trial judge and anamended and consolidated complaint has been filed. Plaintiffs allege breaches offiduciary duties under ERISA and seek restitution on behalf of the plan withrespect to a decline in value of the shares of CMS Energy Common Stock held inthe plan. The plaintiffs also seek other equitable relief and legal fees. Thejudge has conditionally granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification. Atrial date has not been set, but is expected to be no earlier than mid-2006 inthe absence of an intervening settlement of the lawsuits. Settlementnegotiations among counsel for the parties and CMS Energy's fiduciary insurancecarrier are ongoing. In the absence of such a settlement, CMS Energy andConsumers will defend themselves vigorously in this litigation but cannotpredict its outcome.     It is possible that an adverse outcome in this lawsuit could adverselyaffect CMS Energy's and Consumers' financial condition, liquidity or results ofoperations.REGULATORY CHANGES AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS HAVE RESULTED AND COULD CONTINUE TORESULT IN INCREASED COMPETITION IN THE DOMESTIC ENERGY BUSINESS. GENERALLY,INCREASED COMPETITION THREATENS MARKET SHARE IN CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF CMS ENERGY'SBUSINESS AND CAN REDUCE ITS AND CONSUMERS' PROFITABILITY.     Pursuant to the Customer Choice Act, as of January 1, 2002, all electriccustomers in Michigan had the choice of buying electric generation service fromConsumers or an alternative electric supplier. Consumers had experienced, andcould experience in the future, a significant increase in competition forgeneration services due to the introduction of ROA. At December 31, 2005,alternative electric suppliers were providing 552 MW of generation service toROA customers. This amount represents 7 percent of Consumers' total distributionload. It is difficult to predict the total amount of electric supply load thatmay be lost to competitor suppliers in the future.ELECTRIC INDUSTRY REGULATION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CMS ENERGY'S AND CONSUMERS'BUSINESS, INCLUDING THEIR ABILITY TO RECOVER COSTS FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS.     Federal and state regulation of electric utilities has changed dramaticallyin the last two decades and could continue to change over the next severalyears. These changes could adversely affect CMS Energy's and Consumers'business, financial condition and profitability.     There are multiple proceedings pending before the FERC involvingtransmission rates, regional transmission organizations and electric bulk powermarkets and transmission. FERC is also reviewing the standards under whichelectric utilities are allowed to participate in wholesale power markets withoutprice restrictions. CMS                                        32Energy and Consumers cannot predict the impact of these electric industryrestructuring proceedings on their financial position, liquidity or results ofoperations.CMS ENERGY AND CONSUMERS COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO COMPLYWITH ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS AND FACE DIFFICULTY IN RECOVERING THESE COSTS ON ACURRENT BASIS.     CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to costly andincreasingly stringent environmental regulations. They expect that the cost offuture environmental compliance, especially compliance with clean air and waterlaws, will be significant.     In 1998, the EPA issued regulations requiring the State of Michigan tofurther limit nitrogen oxide emissions at coal-fired electric plants. The EPAand State of Michigan regulations require Consumers to make significant capitalexpenditures estimated to be $815 million. As of December 2005, Consumers hasincurred $605 million in capital expenditures to comply with these regulationsand anticipates that the remaining $210 million of capital expenditures will bemade in 2006 through 2011. These expenditures include installing selectivecatalytic reduction technology at four of its coal-fired electric plants. Inaddition to modifying coal-fired electric plants, Consumers compliance planincludes the use of nitrogen oxide emission allowances until all of the controlequipment is operational in 2011. The nitrogen oxide emission allowance annualexpense is projected to be $10 million per year, which Consumers expects torecover from customers through the PSCR process. The projected annual expense isbased on market price forecasts and forecasts of regulatory provisions, known asprogressive flow control, that restrict the usage in any given year ofallowances banked from previous years.     The EPA recently adopted a Clean Air Interstate Rule that requiresadditional coal-fired electric plant emission controls for nitrogen oxides andsulfur dioxide. The rule involves a two-phase program to reduce emissions ofsulfur dioxide by 71 percent and nitrogen oxides by 63 percent by 2015. Thefinal rule will require that Consumers run its selective catalytic controltechnology units year-round beginning in 2009 and may require that it purchaseadditional nitrogen oxide allowances beginning in 2009. In addition to theselective catalytic control technology installed to meet the nitrogen oxidestandards, Consumers' current plan includes installation of flue gasdesulfurization scrubbers. The scrubbers are to be installed by 2014 to meet thePhase I reduction requirements of the Clean Air Interstate Rule at costs similarto those to comply with nitrogen oxide standards.     In May 2005, the EPA issued the Clean Air Mercury Rule, which requiresinitial reductions of mercury emissions from coal-fired electric power plants by2010 and further reductions by 2018. While the industry has not reached aconsensus on the technical methods for curtailing mercury emissions, Consumers'capital and operating costs for mercury emissions reductions are expected to besignificantly less than what was required for selective catalytic reductiontechnology used for nitrogen oxide compliance.     In August 2005, the MDEQ filed a Motion to Intervene in a court challengeto certain aspects of EPA's Clean Air Mercury Rule, asserting that the rule isinadequate. The MDEQ has not indicated the direction that it will pursue to meetor exceed the EPA requirements through a state rulemaking. Consumers is activelyparticipating in dialog with the MDEQ regarding potential paths for controllingmercury emissions and meeting the EPA requirements. In October 2005, the EPAannounced it would reconsider certain aspects of the Clean Air Mercury Rule.Consumers cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.     Several legislative proposals have been introduced in the United StatesCongress that would require reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases;however, none have yet been enacted. CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predictwhether any federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction rules ultimatelywill be enacted, or the specific requirements of any of these rules.     To the extent that greenhouse gas emission reduction rules come intoeffect, the mandatory emissions reduction requirements could have far-reachingand significant implications for the energy sector. CMS Energy and Consumerscannot estimate the potential effect of federal or state level greenhouse gaspolicy on their future consolidated results of operations, cash flows, orfinancial position due to the uncertain nature of the policies at this time.However, CMS Energy and Consumers stay abreast of and engage in greenhouse gaspolicy developments and will continue to assess and respond to the potentialimplications on their business operations.                                        33     These and other required environmental expenditures, if not recovered fromcustomers in Consumers' rates, may require CMS Energy and/or Consumers to seeksignificant additional financing to fund these expenditures and could straintheir cash resources.CMS ENERGY'S AND CONSUMERS' REVENUES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TORISKS THAT ARE BEYOND THEIR CONTROL, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO FUTURETERRORIST ATTACKS OR RELATED ACTS OF WAR.     The cost of repairing damage to CMS Energy's and Consumers' facilities dueto storms, natural disasters, wars, terrorist acts and other catastrophicevents, in excess of insurance recoveries and reserves established for theserepairs, may adversely impact their results of operations, financial conditionand cash flows. The occurrence or risk of occurrence of future terroristactivity and the high cost or potential unavailability of insurance to coverthis terrorist activity may impact their results of operations and financialcondition in unpredictable ways. These actions could also result in disruptionsof power and fuel markets. In addition, their natural gas distribution systemand pipelines could be directly or indirectly harmed by future terroristactivity.CONSUMERS' OWNERSHIP OF A NUCLEAR GENERATING FACILITY CREATES RISK RELATING TONUCLEAR ENERGY.     Consumers owns the Palisades nuclear power plant and is, therefore, subjectto the risks of nuclear generation, including the risks associated with theoperation of plant facilities and the storage and disposal of spent fuel andother radioactive waste. The NRC has broad authority under federal law to imposelicensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nucleargeneration facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authorityto impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment ofthe severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. In addition, if aserious nuclear incident were to occur at Consumers' plant, it could harmConsumers' results of operations and financial condition. A major incident at anuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibitthe operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.     In December 2005, Consumers announced plans to sell the Palisades plant ina competitive bid process expected to lead to a sale in 2007.CONSUMERS CURRENTLY UNDERRECOVERS IN ITS RATES ITS PAYMENTS TO THE MCVPARTNERSHIP FOR CAPACITY AND ENERGY, AND IS ALSO EXPOSED TO FUTURE CHANGES INTHE MCV PARTNERSHIP'S FINANCIAL CONDITION THROUGH ITS EQUITY AND LESSORINVESTMENTS.     The MCV PPA expires in 2025. Under the MCV PPA, variable energy payments tothe MCV Partnership are based on the cost of coal burned at Consumers' coalplants and its operation and maintenance expenses. However, the MCVPartnership's costs of producing electricity are tied to the cost of naturalgas. Natural gas prices have increased substantially in recent years andthroughout 2005. In 2005, the MCV Partnership reevaluated the economics ofoperating the MCV Facility and recorded an impairment. For additional details onthe impairment of the MCV Facility, see ""Periodic reviews of the values of CMSEnergy's and Consumers' assets could result in additional accounting chargessuch as the recent asset impairment charges they took relating to their interestin the MCV Partnership"" above.     Further, the cost that Consumers incurs under the MCV PPA exceeds therecovery amount allowed by the MPSC. Underrecoveries of capacity and fixedenergy payments totaled $59 million in 2005. Consumers estimates underrecoveriesof $55 million in 2006 and $39 million in 2007. After September 15, 2007, itexpects to claim relief under the regulatory out provision in the MCV PPA,thereby limiting its capacity and fixed energy payments to the MCV Partnershipto the amounts that it collects from its customers. The MCV Partnership hasindicated that it may take issue with Consumers' exercise of the regulatory outclause after September 15, 2007. Consumers believes that the clause is valid andfully effective, but cannot assure that it will prevail in the event of adispute. The MPSC's future actions on the capacity and fixed energy paymentsrecoverable from customers subsequent to September 15, 2007 may affectnegatively the financial performance of the MCV Partnership.     In January 2005, Consumers implemented the RCP. The underlying agreementfor the RCP between Consumers and the MCV Partnership extends through the termof the MCV PPA. However, either party may terminate that agreement under certainconditions. In February 2005, a group of intervenors in the RCP case filed                                        34for rehearing of the MPSC order approving the RCP. The Attorney General alsofiled an appeal with the Michigan Court of Appeals. Consumers cannot predict theoutcome of these matters.     CMS Energy and Consumers cannot estimate, at this time, the impact of theseissues on Consumers' future earnings or cash flow from its interest in the MCVPartnership. The ability to develop a new long-term strategy with respect to theMCV Facility, the future price of natural gas and an MPSC decision related toConsumers' recovery of capacity payments are the three most significantvariables in the analysis of the MCV Partnership's future financial performance.It is not presently possible to predict the success of the ability to develop anew long -- term strategy with respect to the MCV Facility, the future price ofnatural gas, or the actions of the MPSC in 2007 or later. For these reasons, atthis time CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the impact of these issues onConsumers' future earnings or cash flows or on the value of its equity interestin the MCV Partnership and CMS Energy's lessor interest in the FMLP.CONSUMERS' ENERGY RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN MANAGINGFUEL AND ELECTRICITY PRICING RISKS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN UNANTICIPATEDLIABILITIES TO CONSUMERS OR INCREASED VOLATILITY OF ITS EARNINGS.     Consumers is exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas, coal,electricity and emission credits. Prices for natural gas, coal, electricity andemission credits may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods oftime and expose Consumers to commodity price risk. A substantial portion ofConsumers' operating expenses for its plants consists of the costs of obtainingthese commodities. Consumers manages these risks using established policies andprocedures, and it may use various contracts to manage these risks, includingswaps, options, futures and forward contracts. No assurance can be made thatthese strategies will be successful in managing Consumers' pricing risk, or thatthey will not result in net liabilities to Consumers as a result of futurevolatility in these markets.     Natural gas prices in particular have historically been volatile. To managemarket risks associated with the volatility of natural gas prices, the MCVPartnership maintains a gas hedging program. The MCV Partnership enters intonatural gas futures contracts, option contracts and over-the-counter swaptransactions in order to hedge against unfavorable changes in the market priceof natural gas in future months when gas is expected to be needed. Thesefinancial instruments are being used principally to secure anticipated naturalgas requirements necessary for projected electric and steam sales, and to lockin sales prices of natural gas previously obtained in order to optimize the MCVPartnership's existing gas supply, storage and transportation arrangements.Consumers also routinely enters into contracts to offset its positions, such ashedging exposure to the risks of demand, market effects of weather and changesin commodity prices associated with its gas distribution business. Thesepositions are taken in conjunction with the GCR mechanism, which allowsConsumers to recover prudently incurred costs associated with those positions.However, neither Consumers nor the MCV Partnership always hedges the entireexposure of its operations from commodity price volatility. Furthermore, theability to hedge exposure to commodity price volatility depends on liquidcommodity markets. As a result, to the extent the commodity markets areilliquid, Consumers may not be able to execute its risk management strategies,which could result in greater open positions than preferred at a given time. Tothe extent that open positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improveor diminish CMS Energy's and Consumers' financial results and financialposition.                                        35"
