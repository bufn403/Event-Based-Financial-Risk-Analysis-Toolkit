5,ACU,ACME UNITED CORP,2024-03-07,"Risk Factors
Ownership of the Company’s securities involves a number of risks and uncertainties. Potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before deciding whether to invest in the Company’s securities. The Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The risks described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks that are currently unknown to the Company or that the Company currently considers immaterial may also impair its business or adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations.Industry and Operational Risks6 The Company is subject to a number of significant operational risks that might cause the Company’s actual results to vary materially from its forecasts, targets or projections, including:•failing to achieve planned revenue and profit growth in each of the Company's business segments;•changes in customer requirements and in the volume of sales to principal customers;•the ability of the Company to anticipate timing of orders and shipments particularly in the e-commerce area;•reliance on third party distributors;•emergence of new competitors or consolidation of existing competitors; and•industry demand fluctuations.The Company’s expectations for both short and long-term future net revenues are based on the Company’s estimates of future demand. Orders from the Company’s principal customers are ultimately based on demand from end-users and end-user demand can be difficult to predict. Low end-user demand would negatively affect orders the Company receives from distributors and other principal customers which could, in turn adversely affect the Company’s revenues in any fiscal period. Additionally, revenue is based, in part, upon the Company’s ability to source its products and timely ship them to customers to meet such demand. If the Company’s estimates of sales are not accurate and the Company experiences unforeseen variability in its revenues and operating results, the Company may be unable to adjust its expense levels accordingly and its profit margins could be adversely affected. We expect to continue to experience inflationary pressure on our cost structure, and price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases or may result in sales volume declines.  Although inflation in the United States had been relatively low for many years,  from 2021 to the present, the United States’ economy has experienced a substantial rise in the inflation rate. There is increased uncertainty as to whether the rise in inflation will continue and for how long. Increases in inflation raise the Company’s costs for labor, raw materials and services. Future market and competitive pressures may prohibit the Company from raising prices to offset increased raw material, or other product costs, including but not limited to packaging, direct labor, overhead, employee benefits, shipping costs, and other inflationary items, or to offset currency fluctuations. The inability to pass these costs through to the Company’s customers could have a negative effect on its results of operations. Commencing in the first half of 2022 the Company was not able to fully pass these costs along to customers.  In the future, we may continue to experience future inflationary pressure on our cost structure. We may be able to pass some or all of these cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products in the future; however, higher product prices may also result in a reduction in sales volume and/or consumption. If we are not able to mitigate these inflationary pressures, such as by increasing our selling prices sufficiently, there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.The ability to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner and to satisfy our customers’ fulfillment standards are subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control. Timely delivery of our products and the fulfillment of consumer demand throughout the year is critical to our success. Various factors that might affect product delivery to customers include vendor production delays, difficulties encountered in shipping from overseas, availability of shipping containers, customs clearance delays, and cybersecurity attacks on our vendors. We also rely upon third-party carriers for our product shipments from our distribution centers to customers. Accordingly, we are subject to risks, including inclement weather, natural disasters, cybersecurity attacks, general availability of trucks, and increased security restrictions associated with such carriers’ ability to provide delivery services to meet our shipping needs. The COVID-19 pandemic caused and future pandemics could cause disruptions in our global supply chain as a result of shortages of factory workers, travel restrictions, barriers to the movement of goods, and temporary closures of production facilities and distribution centers, all of which factors have resulted in extended lead times. Failure to deliver products to our customers in a timely and effective manner, has, in a number of instances, subjected us to penalties pursuant to certain of our contractual arrangements. Should any of the foregoing occur to a material extent, our reputation and brands could be damaged and we could suffer the loss of customers or reduced orders.If we do not successfully optimize and manage our fulfillment processes, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed. If we do not optimize and manage our fulfillment processes successfully and efficiently, it could result in excess or insufficient fulfillment, an increase in costs or impairment charges or harm our business in other ways. If we do not have sufficient fulfillment capacity or experience a 7 problem fulfilling orders in a timely manner, our customers may experience delays in receiving their purchases, which could harm our reputation and our relationship with our customers.If we add new products or categories with different fulfillment requirements or change the mix in products that we sell, our fulfillment will become increasingly complex. Failure to successfully address such challenges in a cost-effective and timely manner could impair our ability to timely deliver our customers’ purchases and could harm our reputation and ultimately, our business, financial condition and operating results.If we grow faster than we anticipate, we may exceed our distribution centers’ capacity, we may experience problems fulfilling orders in a timely manner or our customers may experience delays in receiving their purchases, which could harm our reputation and our relationship with our customers, and we would need to increase our capital expenditures more than anticipated.Matters relating to the employment market and prevailing wage standards may adversely affect our business.Our ability to meet our labor needs on a cost-effective basis is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of qualified personnel in the workforce in the local markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates which have increased significantly, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment and labor laws. In the event prevailing wage rates continue to increase in the markets in which we operate, we may be required to concurrently increase the wages paid to our employees to maintain the quality of our workforce and customer service. To the extent such increases are not offset by price increases, our profit margins may decrease as a result. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of meeting our business needs and expectations, our business and brand image may be impaired. Any failure to meet our staffing needs or any material increase in turnover rates of our employees may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Further, we rely on the ability to attract and retain labor on a cost-effective basis.  Our ability to attract and retain a sufficient workforce on a cost-effective basis depends on several factors. We may not be able to attract and retain a sufficient workforce on a cost-effective basis in the future. In the event of increased costs of attracting and retaining a workforce, our profit margins may materially decline as a result.The Company’s Westcott business is subject to risks associated with seasonality which could adversely affect its cash flow, financial condition, or results of operations.The Company’s business, historically, has experienced higher sales volume in the second and third quarters of the calendar year, when compared to the first and fourth quarters. The Company is a major supplier of products related to the “back-to-school” season, which occurs principally during the months of May through August. If this typical seasonal increase in sales of certain portions of the Company’s product line does not materialize in any year for any reason, the Company could experience a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.Failure to manage growth and continue to expand our operations successfully could adversely affect our financial results.Our business has experienced significant historical growth both internally and through acquisitions through the years including through the acquisitions of Safety Made in 2022 and Hawktree in 2023. We expect our business to continue to grow organically and seek to grow through strategic acquisitions both domestically and internationally. This growth places significant demands on management and operational systems. If we cannot effectively manage our growth, we would likely experience operational inefficiencies and incur unanticipated costs, thus negatively impacting our operating results. To the extent we grow through strategic acquisitions, our success will depend on selecting the appropriate targets, integrating such acquisitions quickly and effectively and realizing any expected synergies and cost savings related to such acquisitions.We may be unable to accurately forecast net sales and appropriately plan our expenses in the future.We base our expense levels on our operating forecasts and estimates of future net sales and gross margins. Net sales and operating results are difficult to forecast, because they generally depend on the volume, timing and type of the orders we receive, all of which are uncertain. Additionally, our business is affected by general economic and business conditions in our markets. We may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in net sales. Any failure to accurately predict net sales or gross margins could cause our operating results in any given quarter, or a series of quarters, to be lower than expected, which could cause the price of our Common Stock to decline substantially.Unfavorable shifts in industry-wide demand for the Company’s products could result in inventory valuation risk.The Company evaluates its ending inventories for excess quantities, impairment of value, and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand based upon input received from our customers, sales team, and management. If inventories on hand are in excess of demand or slow moving, appropriate write-downs may be recorded. In addition, the Company might have to write off inventories that are considered obsolete based upon changes in customer demand, product design changes, or new product 8 introductions, which eliminate demand for existing products. Historically, the Company has not had to materially write down or write off product inventories. Loss of a major customer could result in a decrease in the Company’s future sales and earnings.Sales of our products are primarily concentrated in a few major customers including commercial retailers, office product superstores, and mass market distributors. The Company had two customers in 2023 and 2022, that individually exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales. Net sales to those customers were approximately 14% and 12% in 2023 and 15% and 10% in 2022, respectively. The Company had three customers in 2023 that individually exceeded 10% of consolidated accounts receivable.  Accounts receivable to those customers were approximately 17%, 14%, and 14%. In 2022, the Company had receivables to these customers of approximately 12%, 11%, and 10%, respectively. The Company anticipates that a limited number of customers may account for a substantial portion of its total net revenues for the foreseeable future. The business risks associated with this concentration, including increased credit risks for these and other customers and the possibility of related bad debt write-offs, could negatively affect our margins and profits. Additionally, the loss of a major customer, whether through competition or consolidation, or a disruption in sales to such a customer, could result in a decrease of the Company’s future sales and earnings.Because our products are primarily sold by third parties, our financial results depend in part on the financial health of these parties and any loss of a third-party distributor could adversely affect the Company’s revenues.A large majority of the Company’s products are sold through third-party distributors and large retailers. Some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products. Changes in the financial or business conditions or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could affect our sales and profitability. Additionally, no assurances can be given that any or all of such distributors or retailers will continue their relationships with the Company. Distributors and other significant retail customers cannot easily be replaced and the loss of revenues and the Company’s inability to reduce expenses to compensate for the loss of revenues could adversely affect the Company’s net revenues and profit margins.The loss of key management could adversely affect the Company’s ability to run its business.The Company’s success depends, to a large extent, on the continued service of its executive management team, operating officers and other key personnel. The Company must therefore continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and operating personnel sufficient to maintain its current business and support its projected growth. The Company’s inability to meet its staffing requirements in the future could adversely affect its results of operations. Execution or the lack thereof, of our e-commerce business may reduce our operating results.Our e-commerce business constituted approximately 18% of our net sales in 2023. The continued successful growth of our e-commerce business depends, in part, on third parties and factors over which we have limited control, including difficulty forecasting demand, changing consumer preferences, and e-commerce buying trends, both domestically and abroad, as well as promotional or other advertising initiatives employed by our customers or other third parties on their e-commerce sites. Additionally, sales in our e-commerce distribution channel may also divert sales from our other customers. Additionally, the success of our e-commerce business depends, in part, on the timely receipt of our products by our customers and their end users. The efficient flow of our products requires that our distribution facilities have adequate capacity to support increases in our e-commerce business. If we encounter difficulties with forecasting demand and supply to our distribution facilities, we could face shortages of inventory, resulting in “out of stock” conditions in the e-commerce sites operated by our customers or other third parties, and we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers.Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties might adversely affect the sales in our e-commerce business, as well as damage our brands.The Company is subject to intense competition in all of the markets in which it competes.The Company’s products are sold in highly competitive markets including at mass merchants, high volume office supply stores and online. The Company believes that the principal points of competition in these markets are product innovation, quality, price, merchandising, design and engineering capabilities, product development, timeliness and completeness of delivery, conformity to customer specifications and post-sale support. Competitive conditions may require the Company to match or better competitors’ prices to retain business or market shares. The Company believes that its competitive position will depend on continued investment in innovation and product development, manufacturing and sourcing, quality standards, marketing and customer service and support. The Company’s success will depend in part on its ability to anticipate 9 and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various market categories in which it competes. The Company may not have sufficient resources to make the investments that may be necessary to anticipate those changing needs and the Company may not anticipate, identify, develop and market products successfully or otherwise be successful in maintaining its competitive position. In addition, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in successfully developing and commercializing innovative new products on a continuing basis, and new product launches may not provide expected growth results. There are no significant barriers to entry into the markets for most of the Company’s products.Compromises of our information systems or unauthorized access to confidential information or our customers' or associates' personal information may materially harm our business or damage our reputation.Through our sales and marketing activities and our business operations, we collect and store confidential information and certain personal information from our customers and associates. We also process payment card information and check information. In addition, in the normal course of business, we gather and retain personal information about our associates and generate and have access to confidential business information. Although we have taken steps designed to safeguard such information, there can be no assurance that such information will be protected against unauthorized access or disclosure. Computer hackers, if successful, may misappropriate such information. An employee of the Company, contractor or other third-party with whom we do business may also attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. We could be subject to liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws, for failing to protect personal information, or for misusing personal information, such as use of such information for an unauthorized marketing purpose. Any compromise of our systems or data could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and expose us to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, employees, and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Although the Company has recently reduced its indebtedness, we continue to have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to operate our business. As of December 31, 2023, $13,164,358 was outstanding and $51,835,642 was available for borrowing under the Company’s revolving credit facility. The Company’s manufacturing and distribution facilities in Rocky Mount, NC and Vancouver, WA were financed by a fixed rate mortgage with HSBC Bank, N.A. of which $10,823,033 was outstanding as of December 31, 2023. Our substantial indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have significant consequences for our business. For example, it could:•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations under any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness;•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, business development and other purposes;•compromise our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures, as compared to our competitors, due to our high level of debt and the restrictive covenants in our loan documents;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;•limit our ability to borrow additional funds, or to dispose of pledged assets to raise funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other corporate purposes.These restrictions could adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to successfully implement our growth strategy.In addition, we may need additional financing to support our business and pursue our growth strategy, including for strategic acquisitions. Our ability to obtain additional financing, if and when required, will depend on investor demand, our operating performance, the condition of the capital markets and other factors. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock, and, in the case of equity and equity-linked securities, our existing stockholders may experience dilution.The Company may need to raise additional capital to fund its operations.The Company’s management believes that, under current conditions, the Company’s current cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by operations, together with the borrowing availability under its revolving loan agreement with HSBC Bank N.A., will be sufficient to fund planned 10 operations for the next twelve months from the issuance date of this report. However, if the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, it may be required to find additional funding sources. If adequate financing is unavailable or is unavailable on acceptable terms, the Company may be unable to maintain, develop or enhance its operations, products, and services, take advantage of future opportunities or adequately respond to competitive pressures.Changes in interest rates could adversely affect us.We have exposure to increases in interest rates under our revolving credit loan agreement with HSBC Bank, N.A. which presently bears interest at SOFR + 1.60%. The economy has been experiencing inflation since 2021.  In response to significant and prolonged increases in inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised interest rates multiple times since the beginning of 2022, which has significantly increased our interest expense. Interest rates may remain at the current high levels or continue to increase. Increases in interest rates have increased our interest costs on our variable-rate debt as well as any future fixed rate debt. Any additional increase in the interest which we pay would reduce our cash available for working capital, acquisitions, and other uses.In the event that we experience future pandemics, the economic effects of such pandemics and measures taken to arrest their spread by governmental and regulatory authorities, by the Company’s business partners or by the Company itself could adversely impact our business, including our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.The Company’s business, operations and financial results, may be adversely affected by those risks and uncertainties resulting from any future pandemics. The extent of the impact of any such pandemic on our business, operating results, cash flows, liquidity and financial conditions will be primarily driven by the ultimate duration and severity of the pandemic and its impact on the U.S. and global economies. The military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East have resulted in geopolitical instability. Our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by the negative impacts on the global economy resulting from these conflicts.  In February 2022, Russian military forces invaded Ukraine. In response, Ukrainian military personnel and civilians are actively resisting the invasion. Although the length, impact and outcome of the war is highly unpredictable, this war has contributed to significant market and other disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices and supply of energy resources, instability in financial markets, supply chain interruptions, political and social instability, changes in consumer or purchaser preferences as well as an increase in cyberattacks and espionage. Separately, on October 7, 2023, Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, launched a series of coordinated attacks from the Gaza Strip onto Israel. On October 8, 2023, Israel formally declared war on Hamas, and the armed conflict is ongoing as of the date of this filing. Hostilities between Israel and Hamas could escalate and involve surrounding countries in the Middle East. Furthermore, following Hamas’ attack on Israel, the Houthi movement, which controls parts of Yemen, launched a number of attacks on marine vessels in the Red Sea. The Red Sea is an important maritime route for international trade. As a result of such disruptions, we may experience in the future extended lead times, delays in supplier deliveries, and increased freight costs. The risk of ongoing supply disruptions may further result in delayed deliveries of our products. While the length and total impact of the military conflicts are unpredictable, it has led to market disruptions, including volatility in raw material prices and credit and capital markets, and supply chain challenges. In response to the military conflict, governments in the U.S. and abroad have imposed sanctions against Russia and proposed or threatened additional potential sanctions. These sanctions could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets in which we operate. We do not have manufacturing operations in Ukraine or Russia nor any significant business relationships with Ukraine or Russian-based customers or suppliers. To date, we have not experienced any material impacts of the ongoing military conflict. We are monitoring the situation and its impact on the global markets, which may, in turn, impact our business. For example, it is possible that the conflict could result in lower sales  if supply parts and raw materials for become less available or if there are continued significant increases in energy and fuel prices.  Based on the continued, and more recently increased market volatility and geopolitical unrest pertaining to the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the Middle East, European energy crisis and highly inflationary environment, and corresponding macro-economic uncertainty, we cannot reasonably estimate the full impact the conflict will have on our long-term financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. It is not possible to predict the extent and duration of the military conflict, sanctions, and any associated market disruptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.11  We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, as described below.  A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In connection with the preparation of our annual report for the year ended December 31, 2023, we identified a material weakness related to the Company’s information technology general controls (ITGCs). The material weakness identified is a result of ITGCs that were not designed and operating effectively to ensure IT program and data changes affecting the Company's financial IT applications and underlying accounting records are identified and tested.  Business process controls (automated and manual) that are dependent on the affected ITGCs were also deemed to be ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted. We are in the process of implementing database change management and auditing software, as well as designing and implementing associated management review procedures. The actions deemed taken are subject to continued review, supported by monitoring and testing by management as well as audit committee oversight.  If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner may be materially adversely affected and investor confidence in the Company may be negatively impacted.Legal and Regulatory RisksFailure to protect the Company’s proprietary rights or the costs of protecting these rights could adversely affect its business.The Company’s success depends in part on its ability to obtain patents and trademarks and to preserve other intellectual property rights covering its products and processes. The Company has obtained certain domestic and foreign patents and intends to continue to seek patents on its inventions when appropriate. The process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that pending patents related to any of the Company’s products will be issued, in which case the Company may not be able to legally prevent others from producing similar and/or compatible competing products. If other companies were to sell similar and/or compatible competing products, the Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the Company’s efforts to protect its intellectual property will be successful. Any infringement of the Company’s intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on the Company.If the Company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or cannot obtain necessary intellectual property rights from others, its competitiveness could be negatively impaired.If the Company is found to have violated the trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, including through the use of third-party marks, ideas, or technologies, such a finding could result in the need to cease use of such mark, trade secret, copyrighted work or patented invention in the Company’s business, as well as the obligation to pay for past infringement. If rights holders are willing to permit the Company to continue to use such intellectual property rights, they could require a payment of a substantial amount for continued use of those rights. Either ceasing use or paying such amounts could cause the Company to become less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.Even if the Company is not found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, claims of infringement could adversely affect the Company’s business. The Company could incur significant legal costs and related expenses to defend against such claims, and the Company could incur significant costs associated with discontinuing to use, provide, or manufacture certain products, services or trademarks even if it is ultimately found not to have infringed such rights.Product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect the Company's financial results and reputation.Claims for losses or injuries allegedly caused by some of the Company’s products could arise in the ordinary course of its business. In addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments, product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the Company’s reputation in the marketplace or the value of its brands. The Company also could be required to recall possible defective products, which, if material, could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although the Company maintains product liability insurance coverage, potential product liability claims are subject to a deductible or could be excluded under the terms of the policy. Historically, the Company has not experienced any material product liability claims or regulatory actions.The Company’s businesses and operations are subject to regulation in the U.S. and abroad.12 Changes in laws, regulations and related interpretations may alter the environment in which the Company does business. This includes changes in environmental, data privacy, competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards, taxation and other regulations. Accordingly, regulatory, tax and legal contingencies (including environmental, human resource, product liability, patent and other intellectual property matters), should they exist in the future, could require the Company to record significant reserves or pay significant fines or damages during a reporting period, which could materially impact the Company’s results. In addition, new regulations may be enacted in the U.S. or abroad that may require the Company to incur additional personnel-related, environmental or other costs on an ongoing basis, significantly restrict the Company’s ability to sell certain products, or incur fines or penalties for noncompliance, any of which could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.As a U.S.-based multinational company, the Company is also subject to tax regulations in the U.S. and multiple foreign jurisdictions, some of which are interdependent. For example, certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the U.S. may not be taxed in the U.S. until those earnings are actually repatriated or deemed repatriated. If these or other tax regulations should change, the Company’s financial results could be impacted.Certain or our products and facilities are subject to regulation by the FDA and by analogous foreign regulators.The FDA requires us to register certain of our products and manufacturing facilities. Our facilities in the United States are subject to inspections by the FDA while our facility in Canada is subject to inspection by HealthCanada to confirm compliance with their requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to comply with FDA and HealthCanada requirements applicable to our current products and facilities or any product or facility we may establish in the future. The failure to address any concerns raised by the FDA and HealthCanada could also lead to facility shutdown or the delay or withholding of product approval by these agencies, or product recalls, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The Company is subject to environmental regulation and environmental risks.The Company is subject to national, state, provincial and/or local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations and prohibitions on the discharge and emission of, and establish standards for the use, disposal and management of, certain materials and waste. These environmental laws and regulations also impose liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up sites, and certain damages resulting from present and past spills, disposals, or other releases of hazardous substances or materials. Environmental laws and regulations can be complex and may change often. Capital and operating expenses required to comply with environmental laws and regulations can be significant, and violations may result in substantial fines and penalties. In addition, environmental laws and regulations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, in the United States impose liability on several grounds for the investigation and clean-up of contaminated soil, ground water and buildings and for damages to natural resources on a wide range of properties. For example, contamination at properties formerly owned or operated by the Company, as well as at properties it will own and operate, and properties to which hazardous substances were sent by the Company, may result in liability for the Company under environmental laws and regulations. The costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance, or liability with respect to contamination in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.Risks Related to Our Overseas OperationsThe Company’s operations are global in nature. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions in the countries in which we conduct business, by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and other factors related to our international operations.As our international operations and activities expand, we face increasing exposure to the risks of operating in foreign countries. These factors include:•Changes generally in political, regulatory or economic conditions in the countries in which we conduct business;•Trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products, including government subsidies, tax benefits, changes in local tax rates, trade actions (such as anti-dumping proceedings) and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over the Company;•Changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our competitive position, selling prices and manufacturing costs, and therefore the demand for our products in a particular market; and•The effects of any future pandemics in foreign countries. 13 These risks could affect the cost of manufacturing and selling our products, our pricing, sales volume, and ultimately our financial performance. The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on the Company vary from country to country and are unpredictable.Reliance on foreign suppliers could adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company sources its products from suppliers located in Asia, Europe and the United States. The Company’s Asia vendors are located primarily in China, which subjects the Company to various risks within the region including regulatory, political, economic and foreign currency changes. The Company’s ability to continue to select and retain reliable vendors and suppliers who provide timely deliveries of quality products efficiently will impact its success in meeting customer demand for timely delivery of quality products. The Company’s sourcing operations and its vendors are impacted by labor costs in China and other global locations. Labor historically has been readily available at low cost relative to labor costs in North America. However, labor costs have risen in some regions due to the effects of rapid social, political and economic changes. There can be no assurance that labor will continue to be available to the Company’s suppliers at costs consistent with historical levels or that changes in labor or other laws will not be enacted which would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations. Interruption to supplies from any of the Company’s vendors, or the loss of one or more key vendors, could have a negative effect on the Company’s business and operating results.Changes in currency exchange rates might negatively affect the profitability and business prospects of the Company and its overseas vendors. In particular, the Chinese Renminbi has fluctuated against the U.S. Dollar.  If the Chinese Renminbi continues to increase with respect to the U.S. Dollar in the future, the Company may experience cost increases on such purchases, and this can adversely impact profitability.  The Company may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related effects of the product cost increases.Additional factors that could adversely affect the Company’s business in connection with its foreign suppliers include increases in transportation costs, new or increased import duties, transportation delays, work stoppages, capacity constraints and poor quality; the possibility that the Company might experience any of these factors would increase in the event of future pandemics. Continuing uncertainty in the global economy could negatively impact our business.Uncertainty in the global economy could adversely affect our customers and our suppliers and businesses such as ours. In addition, any uncertainty could have a variety of negative effects on the Company, such as reduction in revenues, increased costs, lower gross margin percentages, increased allowances for doubtful accounts and/or write-offs of accounts receivable and could otherwise have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Changes in trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and their enforcement, may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and outlook.In the past, the United States levied tariffs on the import of some products from China, which is an important source of many of the Company’s products. In order to offset the impact of to these tariffs, the Company has implemented price increases on the affected products. Tariff levels may be further increased and the types of products subject to tariffs may be expanded. Although the Company intends to continue to pass additional price increases on to our customers, such tariff-related developments could have a negative impact on customer demand and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we might have to modify our current business practices, including potentially sourcing from alternative vendors, which could result in inefficiencies and delays in production and cause the Company to incur additional costs.Risks Related to Our Common StockWe cannot provide assurance that we will continue to pay dividends or purchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs.We continue to pay and declare dividends on a quarterly basis and we anticipate that we will continue to do so. However, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash or surplus under applicable law to be able to continue to pay dividends at our current level or purchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. This may result from extraordinary cash expenses, actual expenses exceeding contemplated costs, funding of capital expenditures, increases in reserves or lack of available capital. We may also suspend the payment of dividends or our stock repurchase program if the Board deems such action to be in the best interests of our shareholders. If we do not pay dividends or decrease the amount of dividends we pay, the price of our common stock would likely decrease. At December 31, 2023, a total of 160,365 shares may be purchased in the future under the repurchase program which the Company announced in 2019.14 Our shares of common stock are thinly traded and our stock price may be volatile.Because our common stock is thinly traded, its market price may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market in general or the stock prices of other companies listed on major stock exchanges. There were approximately 3,185,316 shares of our common stock held by non-affiliates as of December 31, 2023. Thus, our common stock is less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and, as a result, the trading price for shares of our common stock may be more volatile. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price for our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger"
10,ACU,ACME UNITED CORP,2023-03-10,"Risk Factors
Ownership of the Company’s securities involves a number of risks and uncertainties. Potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before deciding whether to invest in the Company’s securities. The Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The risks described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks that are currently unknown to the Company or that the Company currently considers immaterial may also impair its business or adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations.Industry and Operational RisksThe Company is subject to a number of significant operational risks that might cause the Company’s actual results to vary materially from its forecasts, targets or projections, including:  •failing to achieve planned revenue and profit growth in each of the Company's business segments;  • changes in customer requirements and in the volume of sales to principal customers;  •the ability of the Company to anticipate timing of orders and shipments particularly in the ecommerce area; 6  ••reliance on third party distributors;emergence of new competitors or consolidation of existing competitors; and  •industry demand fluctuations.The Company’s expectations for both short and long-term future net revenues are based on the Company’s estimates of future demand. Orders from the Company’s principal customers are ultimately based on demand from end-users and end-user demand can be difficult to predict. Low end-user demand would negatively affect orders the Company receives from distributors and other principal customers which could, in turn adversely affect the Company’s revenues in any fiscal period. Additionally, revenue is based, in part, upon the Company’s ability to source its products and timely ship them to customers to meet such demand. If the Company’s estimates of sales are not accurate and the Company experiences unforeseen variability in its revenues and operating results, the Company may be unable to adjust its expense levels accordingly and its profit margins could be adversely affected. We expect to continue to experience inflationary pressure on our cost structure, and price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases or may result in sales volume declines. Although inflation in the United States had been relatively low for many years, there was a significant increase in inflation beginning in the second half of 2021, which has continued into 2022 and through the present. Future market and competitive pressures may prohibit the Company from raising prices to offset increased raw material, or other product costs, including but not limited to packaging, direct labor, overhead, employee benefits, shipping costs, and other inflationary items, whether due to increases in the costs of raw materials or components or to the COVID-19 pandemic, or to offset currency fluctuations. The inability to pass these costs through to the Company’s customers could have a negative effect on its results of operations. Commencing in the first half of 2022 the Company was not able to fully pass these costs along to customers.  We expect for the foreseeable future to experience inflationary pressure on our cost structure. We may be able to pass some or all of these cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products in the future; however, higher product prices may also result in a reduction in sales volume and/or consumption. If we are not able to mitigate these inflationary pressures, such as by increasing our selling prices sufficiently, there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.The ability to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner and to satisfy our customers’ fulfillment standards are subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors presently include the impact of supply chain issues and the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company.Timely delivery of our products and the fulfillment of consumer demand throughout the year is critical to our success. Various factors that might affect product delivery to customers include vendor production delays, difficulties encountered in shipping from overseas, availability of shipping containers, customs clearance delays, and cybersecurity attacks on our vendors. We also rely upon third-party carriers for our product shipments from our distribution centers to customers. Accordingly, we are subject to risks, including inclement weather, natural disasters, cybersecurity attacks, general availability of trucks, and increased security restrictions associated with such carriers’ ability to provide delivery services to meet our shipping needs. The COVID-19 pandemic caused and future pandemics could cause disruptions in our global supply chain as a result of shortages of factory workers, travel restrictions, barriers to the movement of goods, and temporary closures of production facilities and distribution centers, all of which factors have resulted in extended lead times. Failure to deliver products to our customers in a timely and effective manner, has, in a number of instances, subjected us to penalties pursuant to certain of our contractual arrangements. Should any of the foregoing occur to a material extent, our reputation and brands could be damaged and we could suffer the loss of customers or reduced orders.If we do not successfully optimize and manage our fulfillment processes, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed. If we do not optimize and manage our fulfillment processes successfully and efficiently, it could result in excess or insufficient fulfillment, an increase in costs or impairment charges or harm our business in other ways. If we do not have sufficient fulfillment capacity or experience a problem fulfilling orders in a timely manner, our customers may experience delays in receiving their purchases, which could harm our reputation and our relationship with our customers.If we add new products or categories with different fulfillment requirements or change the mix in products that we sell, our fulfillment will become increasingly complex. Failure to successfully address such challenges in a cost-effective and timely manner could impair our ability to timely deliver our customers’ purchases and could harm our reputation and ultimately, our business, financial condition and operating results.If we grow faster than we anticipate, we may exceed our distribution centers’ capacity, we may experience problems fulfilling orders in a timely manner or our customers may experience delays in receiving their purchases, which could harm our reputation and our relationship with our customers, and we would need to increase our capital expenditures more than anticipated.Matters relating to the employment market and prevailing wage standards may adversely affect our business.7Our ability to meet our labor needs on a cost-effective basis is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of qualified personnel in the workforce in the local markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates which have increased significantly, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment and labor laws. In the event prevailing wage rates continue to increase in the markets in which we operate, we may be required to concurrently increase the wages paid to our employees to maintain the quality of our workforce and customer service. To the extent such increases are not offset by price increases, our profit margins may decrease as a result. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of meeting our business needs and expectations, our business and brand image may be impaired. Any failure to meet our staffing needs or any material increase in turnover rates of our employees may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Further, we rely on the ability to attract and retain labor on a cost-effective basis. The availability of labor in certain of the markets in which we operate has declined in recent years and competition for such labor has increased. Our ability to attract and retain a sufficient workforce on a cost-effective basis depends on several factors. We may not be able to attract and retain a sufficient workforce on a cost-effective basis in the future. In the event of increased costs of attracting and retaining a workforce, our profit margins may materially decline as a result.The Company’s Westcott business is subject to risks associated with seasonality which could adversely affect its cash flow, financial condition, or results of operations.The Company’s business, historically, has experienced higher sales volume in the second and third quarters of the calendar year, when compared to the first and fourth quarters. The Company is a major supplier of products related to the “back-to-school” season, which occurs principally during the months of May through August. If this typical seasonal increase in sales of certain portions of the Company’s product line does not materialize in any year for any reason, the Company could experience a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.Failure to manage growth and continue to expand our operations successfully could adversely affect our financial results.Our business has experienced significant historical growth both internally and through acquisitions through the years including through the acquisitions of Safety Made in 2022. We expect our business to continue to grow organically and seek to grow through strategic acquisitions both domestically and internationally. This growth places significant demands on management and operational systems. If we cannot effectively manage our growth, we would likely experience operational inefficiencies and incur unanticipated costs, thus negatively impacting our operating results. To the extent we grow through strategic acquisitions, our success will depend on selecting the appropriate targets, integrating such acquisitions quickly and effectively and realizing any expected synergies and cost savings related to such acquisitions.We may be unable to accurately forecast net sales and appropriately plan our expenses in the future.We base our expense levels on our operating forecasts and estimates of future net sales and gross margins. Net sales and operating results are difficult to forecast, because they generally depend on the volume, timing and type of the orders we receive, all of which are uncertain. Additionally, our business is affected by general economic and business conditions in our markets. We may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in net sales. Any failure to accurately predict net sales or gross margins could cause our operating results in any given quarter, or a series of quarters, to be lower than expected, which could cause the price of our Common Stock to decline substantially.Unfavorable shifts in industry-wide demand for the Company’s products could result in inventory valuation risk.The Company evaluates its ending inventories for excess quantities, impairment of value, and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand based upon input received from our customers, sales team, and management. If inventories on hand are in excess of demand or slow moving, appropriate write-downs may be recorded. In addition, the Company might have to write off inventories that are considered obsolete based upon changes in customer demand, product design changes, or new product introductions, which eliminate demand for existing products. Historically, the Company has not had to materially write down or write off product inventories. Loss of a major customer could result in a decrease in the Company’s future sales and earnings.Sales of our products are primarily concentrated in a few major customers including office product superstores and mass market distributors. The Company had two customers in 2022 and 2021, that individually exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales. Net sales to those customers were approximately 15% and 10% in 2022 and 17% and 11% in 2021, respectively. The Company anticipates that a limited number of customers may account for a substantial portion of its total net revenues for the foreseeable future. The business risks associated with this concentration, including increased credit risks for these and other customers and the possibility of related bad debt write-offs, could negatively affect our margins and profits. Additionally, the loss of a major customer, whether through competition or consolidation, or a disruption in sales to such a customer, could result in a decrease of the Company’s future sales and earnings.8Because our products are primarily sold by third parties, our financial results depend in part on the financial health of these parties and any loss of a third-party distributor could adversely affect the Company’s revenues.A large majority of the Company’s products are sold through third-party distributors and large retailers. Some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products. Changes in the financial or business conditions or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could affect our sales and profitability.Additionally, no assurances can be given that any or all of such distributors or retailers will continue their relationships with the Company. Distributors and other significant retail customers cannot easily be replaced and the loss of revenues and the Company’s inability to reduce expenses to compensate for the loss of revenues could adversely affect the Company’s net revenues and profit margins.The loss of key management could adversely affect the Company’s ability to run its business.The Company’s success depends, to a large extent, on the continued service of its executive management team, operating officers and other key personnel. The Company must therefore continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and operating personnel sufficient to maintain its current business and support its projected growth. The Company’s inability to meet its staffing requirements in the future could adversely affect its results of operations. Execution or the lack thereof, of our e-commerce business may reduce our operating results.Our e-commerce business constituted approximately 17% of our net sales in 2022 and has been our fastest growing distribution channel over the last several years. The continued successful growth of our e-commerce business depends, in part, on third parties and factors over which we have limited control, including difficulty forecasting demand, changing consumer preferences, and e-commerce buying trends, both domestically and abroad, as well as promotional or other advertising initiatives employed by our customers or other third parties on their e-commerce sites. Additionally, sales in our e-commerce distribution channel may also divert sales from our other customers.Additionally, the success of our e-commerce business depends, in part, on the timely receipt of our products by our customers and their end users. The efficient flow of our products requires that our distribution facilities have adequate capacity to support increases in our e-commerce business. If we encounter difficulties with forecasting demand and supply to our distribution facilities, we could face shortages of inventory, resulting in “out of stock” conditions in the e-commerce sites operated by our customers or other third parties, and we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers.Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties might adversely affect the sales in our e-commerce business, as well as damage our brands.The Company is subject to intense competition in all of the markets in which it competes.The Company’s products are sold in highly competitive markets including at mass merchants, high volume office supply stores and online. The Company believes that the principal points of competition in these markets are product innovation, quality, price, merchandising, design and engineering capabilities, product development, timeliness and completeness of delivery, conformity to customer specifications and post-sale support. Competitive conditions may require the Company to match or better competitors’ prices to retain business or market shares. The Company believes that its competitive position will depend on continued investment in innovation and product development, manufacturing and sourcing, quality standards, marketing and customer service and support. The Company’s success will depend in part on its ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various market categories in which it competes. The Company may not have sufficient resources to make the investments that may be necessary to anticipate those changing needs and the Company may not anticipate, identify, develop and market products successfully or otherwise be successful in maintaining its competitive position. In addition, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in successfully developing and commercializing innovative new products on a continuing basis, and new product launches may not provide expected growth results. There are no significant barriers to entry into the markets for most of the Company’s products.Compromises of our information systems or unauthorized access to confidential information or our customers' or associates' personal information may materially harm our business or damage our reputation.Through our sales and marketing activities and our business operations, we collect and store confidential information and certain personal information from our customers and associates. We also process payment card information and check information. In addition, in the normal course of business, we gather and retain personal information about our associates and generate and have access to confidential business information. Although we have taken steps designed to safeguard such information, there can be no assurance that such information will be protected against unauthorized access or disclosure. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our or our vendors' network security and, if successful, misappropriate such information. An employee of the Company, contractor or other third-party with whom we do business may also attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. We could be subject to liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws, for failing to protect personal information, or for misusing personal information, such as use of such information for an unauthorized marketing purpose. Any compromise of our systems or data could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and expose us to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulators, payment 9card associations, employees, and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to operate our business. As of December 31, 2022, $50,000,000 was outstanding and $15,000,000 was available for borrowing under the Company’s revolving credit facility. The Company’s manufacturing and distribution facilities in Rocky Mount, NC and Vancouver, WA were financed by a fixed rate mortgage with HSBC Bank, N.A. of which $11,232,990 was outstanding as of December 31, 2022. Our substantial indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have important consequences for our business. For example, it could:• make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations under any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness;• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, business development and other purposes;• compromise our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures, as compared to our competitors, due to our high level of debt and the restrictive covenants in our loan documents;• limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;• limit our ability to borrow additional funds, or to dispose of assets to raise funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other corporate purposes.These restrictions could adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to successfully implement our growth strategy.In addition, we may need additional financing to support our business and pursue our growth strategy, including for strategic acquisitions. Our ability to obtain additional financing, if and when required, will depend on investor demand, our operating performance, the condition of the capital markets and other factors. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock, and, in the case of equity and equity-linked securities, our existing stockholders may experience dilution.The Company may need to raise additional capital to fund its operations.The Company’s management believes that, under current conditions, the Company’s current cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by operations, together with the borrowing availability under its revolving loan agreement with HSBC Bank N.A., will be sufficient to fund planned operations for the next twelve months from the issuance date of this report. However, if the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, it may be required to find additional funding sources. If adequate financing is unavailable or is unavailable on acceptable terms, the Company may be unable to maintain, develop or enhance its operations, products, and services, take advantage of future opportunities or adequately respond to competitive pressures.Changes in interest rates could adversely affect us.We have exposure to increases in interest rates under our revolving credit loan agreement with HSBC Bank, N.A. which presently bears interest at SOFR + 2.35%. The economy has been experiencing inflation since 2021 and the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised interest rates in an attempt to control such inflation and is likely to continue to do so in the immediate future. Increases in interest rates have increased our interest costs on our variable-rate debt as well as any future fixed rate debt. Any increase in the interest which we pay would reduce our cash available for working capital, acquisitions, and other uses.In the event that we experience future pandemics, the economic effects of such pandemics and measures taken to arrest their spread by governmental and regulatory authorities, by the Company’s business partners or by the Company itself could adversely impact our business, including our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.The Company’s business, operations and financial results, may be adversely affected by those risks and uncertainties resulting from new variant strains of COVID-19, any future pandemics; the effectiveness, availability, and public acceptance of vaccines against potential new viruses. The extent of the impact of such pandemic on our business, operating results, cash flows, liquidity and financial conditions will be primarily driven by the ultimate duration and severity of the pandemic and its impact on the U.S. and global economies.10The military conflict between Russia and Ukraine has resulted in geopolitical instability. Our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by the negative impacts on the global economy resulting from the conflict in Ukraine. In February 2022, Russian troops invaded Ukraine and the military conflict is ongoing. While the length and total impact of the military conflict is unpredictable, it has led to market disruptions, including volatility in raw material prices and credit and capital markets, and supply chain challenges in our European segment. In response to the military conflict, governments in the U.S. and abroad have imposed sanctions against Russia and proposed or threatened additional potential sanctions. These sanctions could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets in which we operate.We do not have manufacturing operations in Ukraine or Russia nor any significant business relationships with Ukraine- or Russian-based customers or suppliers. To date, we have not experienced any material impacts of the ongoing military conflict. We are monitoring the situation and its impact on the global markets, which may, in turn, impact our business. For example, it is possible that the conflict could result in lower sales in Europe if supply parts and raw materials for become less available or if there are continued significant increases in energy and fuel prices. Based on the continued, and more recently increased market volatility and geopolitical unrest pertaining to the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, European energy crisis and highly inflationary environment, and corresponding macro-economic uncertainty, we cannot reasonably estimate the full impact the conflict will have on our long-term financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. It is not possible to predict the extent and duration of the military conflict, sanctions, and any associated market disruptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.If we identify a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting in the future, such material weakness could result in material misstatements in our financial statements.A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal controls is discovered or occur in the future, our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner may be materially adversely affected and investor confidence in the Company may be negatively impacted.Legal and Regulatory RisksFailure to protect the Company’s proprietary rights or the costs of protecting these rights could adversely affect its business.The Company’s success depends in part on its ability to obtain patents and trademarks and to preserve other intellectual property rights covering its products and processes. The Company has obtained certain domestic and foreign patents and intends to continue to seek patents on its inventions when appropriate. The process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that pending patents related to any of the Company’s products will be issued, in which case the Company may not be able to legally prevent others from producing similar and/or compatible competing products. If other companies were to sell similar and/or compatible competing products, the Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the Company’s efforts to protect its intellectual property will be successful. Any infringement of the Company’s intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on the Company.If the Company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or cannot obtain necessary intellectual property rights from others, its competitiveness could be negatively impaired.If the Company is found to have violated the trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, including through the use of third-party marks, ideas, or technologies, such a finding could result in the need to cease use of such mark, trade secret, copyrighted work or patented invention in the Company’s business, as well as the obligation to pay for past infringement. If rights holders are willing to permit the Company to continue to use such intellectual property rights, they could require a payment of a substantial amount for continued use of those rights. Either ceasing use or paying such amounts could cause the Company to become less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.Even if the Company is not found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, claims of infringement could adversely affect the Company’s business. The Company could incur significant legal costs and related expenses to defend against such claims, and the Company could incur significant costs associated with discontinuing to use, provide, or manufacture certain products, services or trademarks even if it is ultimately found not to have infringed such rights.Product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect the Company's financial results and reputation.11Claims for losses or injuries allegedly caused by some of the Company’s products could arise in the ordinary course of its business. In addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments, product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the Company’s reputation in the marketplace or the value of its brands. The Company also could be required to recall possible defective products, which, if material, could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although the Company maintains product liability insurance coverage, potential product liability claims are subject to a deductible or could be excluded under the terms of the policy. Historically, the Company has not experienced any material product liability claims or regulatory actions.The Company’s businesses and operations are subject to regulation in the U.S. and abroad.Changes in laws, regulations and related interpretations may alter the environment in which the Company does business. This includes changes in environmental, data privacy, competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards, taxation and other regulations. Accordingly, regulatory, tax and legal contingencies (including environmental, human resource, product liability, patent and other intellectual property matters), should they exist in the future, could require the Company to record significant reserves or pay significant fines or damages during a reporting period, which could materially impact the Company’s results. In addition, new regulations may be enacted in the U.S. or abroad that may require the Company to incur additional personnel-related, environmental or other costs on an ongoing basis, significantly restrict the Company’s ability to sell certain products, or incur fines or penalties for noncompliance, any of which could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.As a U.S.-based multinational company, the Company is also subject to tax regulations in the U.S. and multiple foreign jurisdictions, some of which are interdependent. For example, certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the U.S. may not be taxed in the U.S. until those earnings are actually repatriated or deemed repatriated. If these or other tax regulations should change, the Company’s financial results could be impacted.Certain or our products and facilities are subject to regulation by the FDA and by analogous foreign regulators.The FDA requires us to register certain of our products and manufacturing facilities. The FDA also inspects these facilities and products to confirm compliance with its requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to comply with FDA requirements applicable to our current products and facilities or any product or facility we may establish in the future. The failure to address any concerns raised by the FDA could also lead to facility shutdown or the delay or withholding of product approval by the FDA, or product recalls, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The Company is subject to environmental regulation and environmental risks.The Company is subject to national, state, provincial and/or local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations and prohibitions on the discharge and emission of, and establish standards for the use, disposal and management of, certain materials and waste. These environmental laws and regulations also impose liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up sites, and certain damages resulting from present and past spills, disposals, or other releases of hazardous substances or materials. Environmental laws and regulations can be complex and may change often. Capital and operating expenses required to comply with environmental laws and regulations can be significant, and violations may result in substantial fines and penalties. In addition, environmental laws and regulations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, in the United States impose liability on several grounds for the investigation and clean-up of contaminated soil, ground water and buildings and for damages to natural resources on a wide range of properties. For example, contamination at properties formerly owned or operated by the Company, as well as at properties it will own and operate, and properties to which hazardous substances were sent by the Company, may result in liability for the Company under environmental laws and regulations. The costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance, or liability with respect to contamination in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.Risks Related to Our Overseas OperationsThe Company’s operations are global in nature. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions in the countries in which we conduct business, by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and other factors related to our international operations.As our international operations and activities expand, we face increasing exposure to the risks of operating in foreign countries. These factors include: •The duration, severity, spread and recurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic in foreign countries, including through variant strains of the      underlying virus. •Changes generally in political, regulatory or economic conditions in the countries in which we conduct business;12 •Trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products, including government subsidies, tax benefits, changes in local tax rates, trade actions (such as anti-dumping proceedings) and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over the Company; •Changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our competitive position, selling prices and manufacturing costs, and therefore the demand for our products in a particular market; andThese risks could affect the cost of manufacturing and selling our products, our pricing, sales volume, and ultimately our financial performance. The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on the Company vary from country to country and are unpredictable.Reliance on foreign suppliers could adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company sources its products from suppliers located in Asia, Europe and the United States. The Company’s Asia vendors are located primarily in China, which subjects the Company to various risks within the region including regulatory, political, economic and foreign currency changes, and, commencing in 2020 through the present, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company’s ability to continue to select and retain reliable vendors and suppliers who provide timely deliveries of quality products efficiently will impact its success in meeting customer demand for timely delivery of quality products. The Company’s sourcing operations and its vendors are impacted by labor costs in China. Labor historically has been readily available at low cost relative to labor costs in North America. However, labor costs have risen in some regions due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of rapid social, political and economic changes. There can be no assurance that labor will continue to be available to the Company’s suppliers in China at costs consistent with historical levels or that changes in labor or other laws will not be enacted which would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations in China. Interruption to supplies from any of the Company’s vendors, or the loss of one or more key vendors, could have a negative effect on the Company’s business and operating results.Changes in currency exchange rates might negatively affect the profitability and business prospects of the Company and its overseas vendors. In particular, the Chinese Renminbi has fluctuated against the U.S. Dollar during the last two years and is unpredictable. If the Chinese Renminbi continues to increase with respect to the U.S. Dollar in the future, the Company may experience cost increases on such purchases, and this can adversely impact profitability. Future interventions by China may result in further currency appreciation and increase our product costs over time. The Company may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related effects of the product cost increases.Additional factors that could adversely affect the Company’s business in connection with its foreign suppliers include increases in transportation costs, new or increased import duties, transportation delays, work stoppages, capacity constraints and poor quality; the possibility that the Company might experience any of these factors has been increased by the COVID-19 pandemic.Continuing uncertainty in the global economy could negatively impact our business.Uncertainty in the global economy could adversely affect our customers and our suppliers and businesses such as ours. In addition, any uncertainty could have a variety of negative effects on the Company, such as reduction in revenues, increased costs, lower gross margin percentages, increased allowances for doubtful accounts and/or write-offs of accounts receivable and could otherwise have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Changes in trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and their enforcement, may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and outlook.In the past, the United States levied tariffs on the import of some products from China, which is an important source of many of the Company’s products. In order to offset the impact of to these tariffs, the Company has implemented price increases on the affected products. Tariff levels may be further increased and the types of products subject to tariffs may be expanded. Although the Company intends to continue to pass additional price increases on to our customers, such tariff-related developments could have a negative impact on customer demand and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we might have to modify our current business practices, including potentially sourcing from alternative vendors, which could result in inefficiencies and delays in production and cause the Company to incur additional costs.Risks Related to Our Common StockWe cannot provide assurance that we will continue to pay dividends or purchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs.13We continue to pay and declare dividends on a quarterly basis and we anticipate that we will continue to do so. However, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash or surplus under applicable law to be able to continue to pay dividends at our current level or purchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. This may result from extraordinary cash expenses, actual expenses exceeding contemplated costs, funding of capital expenditures, increases in reserves or lack of available capital. We may also suspend the payment of dividends or our stock repurchase program if the Board deems such action to be in the best interests of our shareholders. If we do not pay dividends or decrease the amount of dividends we pay, the price of our common stock would likely decrease. At December 31, 2022, a total of 160,365 shares may be purchased in the future under the repurchase program which the Company announced in 2019.Our shares of common stock are thinly traded and our stock price may be volatile.Because our common stock is thinly traded, its market price may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market in general or the stock prices of other companies listed on major stock exchanges. There were approximately 3,090,453 shares of our common stock held by non-affiliates as of December 31, 2022. Thus, our common stock is less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and, as a result, the trading price for shares of our common stock may be more volatile. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price for our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger"
9,ACU,ACME UNITED CORP,2022-03-30,"Risk Factors
Ownership of the Company’s securities involves a number of risks and uncertainties. Potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before deciding whether to invest in the Company’s securities. The Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The risks described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks that are currently unknown to the Company or that the Company currently considers immaterial may also impair its business or adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations.Industry and Operational RisksThe Company is subject to a number of significant operational risks that might cause the Company’s actual results to vary materially from its forecasts, targets or projections, including: •achieving planned revenue and profit growth in each of the Company's business segments;  •changes in customer requirements and in the volume of sales to principal customers;  •the ability of the Company to anticipate timing of orders and shipments particularly in the ecommerce area;  •emergence of new competitors or consolidation of existing competitors; and  •industry demand fluctuations.The Company’s expectations for both short and long-term future net revenues are based on the Company’s estimates of future demand. Orders from the Company’s principal customers are ultimately based on demand from end-users and end-user demand can be difficult to predict. Low end-user demand would negatively affect orders the Company receives from distributors and other principal customers which could, in turn adversely affect the Company’s revenues in any fiscal period. Additionally, revenue is based, in part, upon the Company’s ability to source its products and timely ship them to customers to meet such demand.  If the Company’s estimates of sales are not accurate and the Company experiences unforeseen variability in its revenues and operating results, the Company may be unable to adjust its expense levels accordingly and its profit margins could be adversely affected. If we identify a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, such material weakness could result in material misstatements in our financial statements.During the year ended December 31, 2020, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the Company’s inventory cycle count program at our Rocky Mount, NC warehouse (the Warehouse), as described below. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis However, there 6were no material misstatements in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of this material weakness. To remediate the material weakness, at the end of 2021, the Company conducted a full physical inventory count at the Warehouse to provide evidence on existence of its inventory for the year ended December 31, 2021. As a result, the Company concluded that the controls were appropriately designed and operating effectively and further concluded that the material weakness had been remediated. In addition, our independent public accounting firm, Marcum LLP, expressed an unqualified opinion on our consolidated financial statements in each of the two years for the period ended December 31, 2021.  If additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner may be materially adversely affected and investor confidence in the Company may be negatively impacted. Because our products are primarily sold by third parties, our financial results depend in part on the financial health of these parties and any loss of a third-party distributor could adversely affect the Company’s revenues.A large majority of the Company’s products are sold through third-party distributors and large retailers. Some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products. Changes in the financial or business conditions or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could affect our sales and profitability.Additionally, no assurances can be given that any or all of such distributors or retailers will continue their relationships with the Company. Distributors and other significant retail customers cannot easily be replaced and the loss of revenues and the Company’s inability to reduce expenses to compensate for the loss of revenues could adversely affect the Company’s net revenues and profit margins. The ability to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner and to satisfy our customers’ fulfillment standards are subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors presently include the impact of supply chain issues and the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company.Customers place great emphasis on timely delivery of our products for specific selling seasons, especially during our second and third fiscal quarters, and on the fulfillment of consumer demand throughout the year. We cannot control all of the various factors that might affect product delivery to customers. On-going risks of our business include vendor production delays, difficulties encountered in shipping from overseas, availability of shipping containers, customs clearance delays, and cybersecurity attacks on our vendors. We also rely upon third-party carriers for our product shipments from our distribution centers to customers. Accordingly, we are subject to risks, including labor disputes, inclement weather, natural disasters, cybersecurity attacks, possible acts of terrorism, general availability of trucks, and increased security restrictions associated with such carriers’ ability to provide delivery services to meet our shipping needs. The COVID-19 pandemic caused and continues to cause disruptions in our global supply chain as a result of shortages of factory workers, travel restrictions, barriers to the movement of goods, and temporary closures of production facilities and distribution centers, all of which factors have resulted in extended lead times. Failure to deliver products to our customers in a timely and effective manner, often under special vendor requirements to use specific carriers and delivery schedules, has, in a number of instances, subjected us to penalties pursuant to certain of our contractual arrangements.  Should any of the foregoing occur to a material extent, our reputation and brands could be damaged and we could suffer the loss of customers or reduced orders.Matters relating to the employment market and prevailing wage standards may adversely affect our business.Our ability to meet our labor needs on a cost-effective basis is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of qualified personnel in the workforce in the local markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates which have increased significantly, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment and labor laws. In the event prevailing wage rates continue to increase in the markets in which we operate, we may be required to concurrently increase the wages paid to our employees to maintain the quality of our workforce and customer service. To the extent such increases are not offset by price increases, our profit margins may decrease as a result. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of meeting our business needs and expectations, our business and brand image may be impaired. Any failure to meet our staffing needs or any material increase in turnover rates of our employees may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Further, we rely on the ability to attract and retain labor on a cost-effective basis. The availability of labor in certain of the markets in which we operate has declined in recent years and competition for such labor has increased, especially under the economic crises experienced throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Our ability to attract and retain a sufficient workforce on a cost-effective basis depends on several factors, including 7the ability to protect staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. We may not be able to attract and retain a sufficient workforce on a cost-effective basis in the future. In the event of increased costs of attracting and retaining a workforce, our profit margins may materially decline as a result.The Company’s business is subject to risks associated with seasonality which could adversely affect its cash flow, financial condition, or results of operations.The Company’s business, historically, has experienced higher sales volume in the second and third quarters of the calendar year, when compared to the first and fourth quarters. The Company is a major supplier of products related to the “back-to-school” season, which occurs principally during the months of May through August. If this typical seasonal increase in sales of certain portions of the Company’s product line does not materialize in any year for any reason, including the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company could experience a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.Failure to manage growth and continue to expand our operations successfully could adversely affect our financial results.Our business has experienced significant historical growth over the years including through two new strategic acquisitions in 2020. We expect our business to continue to grow organically and seek to grow through strategic acquisitions both domestically and internationally. This growth places significant demands on management and operational systems. If we cannot effectively manage our growth, we would likely experience operational inefficiencies and incur unanticipated costs, thus negatively impacting our operating results. To the extent we grow through strategic acquisitions, our success will depend on selecting the appropriate targets, integrating such acquisitions quickly and effectively and realizing any expected synergies and cost savings related to such acquisitions.Unfavorable shifts in industry-wide demand for the Company’s products could result in inventory valuation risk.The Company evaluates its ending inventories for excess quantities, impairment of value, and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand based upon input received from our customers, sales team, and management. If inventories on hand are in excess of demand or slow moving, appropriate write-downs may be recorded. In addition, the Company might have to write off inventories that are considered obsolete based upon changes in customer demand, product design changes, or new product introductions, which eliminate demand for existing products. Historically, the Company has not had to write down or write off product inventories. Loss of a major customer could result in a decrease in the Company’s future sales and earnings.Sales of our products are primarily concentrated in a few major customers including office product superstores and mass market distributors. The Company had two customers in 2021 and 2020, respectively, that individually exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales. Net sales to those customers were approximately 17% and 11% in 2021 and 18% and 12% in 2020, respectively. The Company anticipates that a limited number of customers may account for a substantial portion of its total net revenues for the foreseeable future. The business risks associated with this concentration, including increased credit risks for these and other customers and the possibility of related bad debt write-offs, could negatively affect our margins and profits. Additionally, the loss of a major customer, whether through competition or consolidation, or a disruption in sales to such a customer, could result in a decrease of the Company’s future sales and earnings.The loss of key management could adversely affect the Company’s ability to run its business.The Company’s success depends, to a large extent, on the continued service of its executive management team, operating officers and other key personnel. The Company must therefore continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and operating personnel sufficient to maintain its current business and support its projected growth. The Company’s inability to meet its staffing requirements in the future could adversely affect its results of operations. Execution or the lack thereof, of our e-commerce business may reduce our operating results.Our e-commerce business constituted approximately 18% of our net sales in 2021 and has been our fastest growing distribution channel over the last several years. The continued successful growth of our e-commerce business depends, in part, on third parties and factors over which we have limited control, including difficulty forecasting demand, changing consumer preferences, and e-commerce buying trends, both 8domestically and abroad, as well as promotional or other advertising initiatives employed by our customers or other third parties on their e-commerce sites. Additionally, sales in our e-commerce distribution channel may also divert sales from our other customers.Additionally, the success of our e-commerce business depends, in part, on the timely receipt of our products by our customers and their end users. The efficient flow of our products requires that our distribution facilities have adequate capacity to support increases in our e-commerce business. If we encounter difficulties with forecasting demand and supply to our distribution facilities, we could face shortages of inventory, resulting in “out of stock” conditions in the e-commerce sites operated by our customers or other third parties, and we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers.Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties might adversely affect the sales in our e-commerce business, as well as damage our brands.The Company may not be able to maintain or to raise prices in response to increasing costs or inflation.Future market and competitive pressures may prohibit the Company from raising prices to offset increased product costs, shipping costs, labor costs, and other inflationary items, whether due to increases in the costs of raw materials or components or to the COVID-19 pandemic, or to offset currency fluctuations. The inability to pass these costs through to the Company’s customers could have a negative effect on its results of operations.The Company is subject to intense competition in all of the markets in which it competes.The Company’s products are sold in highly competitive markets including at mass merchants, high volume office supply stores and online. The Company believes that the principal points of competition in these markets are product innovation, quality, price, merchandising, design and engineering capabilities, product development, timeliness and completeness of delivery, conformity to customer specifications and post-sale support. Competitive conditions may require the Company to match or better competitors’ prices to retain business or market shares. The Company believes that its competitive position will depend on continued investment in innovation and product development, manufacturing and sourcing, quality standards, marketing and customer service and support. The Company’s success will depend in part on its ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various market categories in which it competes. The Company may not have sufficient resources to make the investments that may be necessary to anticipate those changing needs and the Company may not anticipate, identify, develop and market products successfully or otherwise be successful in maintaining its competitive position. In addition, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in successfully developing and commercializing innovative new products on a continuing basis, and new product launches may not provide expected growth results. There are no significant barriers to entry into the markets for most of the Company’s products.Compromises of our information systems or unauthorized access to confidential information or our customers' or associates' personal information may materially harm our business or damage our reputation.Through our sales and marketing activities and our business operations, we collect and store confidential information and certain personal information from our customers and associates. We also process payment card information and check information. In addition, in the normal course of business, we gather and retain personal information about our associates and generate and have access to confidential business information. Although we have taken steps designed to safeguard such information, there can be no assurance that such information will be protected against unauthorized access or disclosure. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our or our vendors' network security and, if successful, misappropriate such information. An employee of the Company, contractor or other third-party with whom we do business may also attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. We could be subject to liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws, for failing to protect personal information, or for misusing personal information, such as use of such information for an unauthorized marketing purpose. Any compromise of our systems or data could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and expose us to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, employees, and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The Company may need to raise additional capital to fund its operations.The Company’s management believes that, under current conditions, the Company’s current cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by operations, together with the borrowing availability under its revolving loan agreement with HSBC Bank N.A., will be sufficient to fund planned operations for the next twelve months from the issuance date of this report. However, if the Company is unable to generate sufficient 9cash from operations, it may be required to find additional funding sources. If adequate financing is unavailable or is unavailable on acceptable terms, the Company may be unable to maintain, develop or enhance its operations, products, and services, take advantage of future opportunities or adequately respond to competitive pressures.Changes in interest rates could adversely affect us.We have exposure to increases in interest rates under our revolving credit loan agreement with HSBC Bank, N.A. which presently bears interest at the Prime Rate less 1.25%. In response to the COVID pandemic, actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banking institutions were taken to create and maintain a low interest rate environment.  However, the U.S. Federal Reserve has indicated that it intends to increase interest rates in 2022.  Increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs on our variable-rate debt as well as any future fixed rate debt. Any increase in the interest which we pay would reduce our cash available for working capital, acquisitions, and other uses.Legal and Regulatory RisksFailure to protect the Company’s proprietary rights or the costs of protecting these rights could adversely affect its business.The Company’s success depends in part on its ability to obtain patents and trademarks and to preserve other intellectual property rights covering its products and processes. The Company has obtained certain domestic and foreign patents and intends to continue to seek patents on its inventions when appropriate. The process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that pending patents related to any of the Company’s products will be issued, in which case the Company may not be able to legally prevent others from producing similar and/or compatible competing products. If other companies were to sell similar and/or compatible competing products, the Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the Company’s efforts to protect its intellectual property will be successful. Any infringement of the Company’s intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on the Company.If the Company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or cannot obtain necessary intellectual property rights from others, its competitiveness could be negatively impaired.If the Company is found to have violated the trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, including through the use of third-party marks, ideas, or technologies, such a finding could result in the need to cease use of such mark, trade secret, copyrighted work or patented invention in the Company’s business, as well as the obligation to pay for past infringement. If rights holders are willing to permit the Company to continue to use such intellectual property rights, they could require a payment of a substantial amount for continued use of those rights. Either ceasing use or paying such amounts could cause the Company to become less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.Even if the Company is not found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, claims of infringement could adversely affect the Company’s business. The Company could incur significant legal costs and related expenses to defend against such claims, and the Company could incur significant costs associated with discontinuing to use, provide, or manufacture certain products, services or trademarks even if it is ultimately found not to have infringed such rights.Product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect the Company's financial results and reputation.Claims for losses or injuries allegedly caused by some of the Company’s products could arise in the ordinary course of its business. In addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments, product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the Company’s reputation in the marketplace or the value of its brands. The Company also could be required to recall possible defective products, which, if material, could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although the Company maintains product liability insurance coverage, potential product liability claims are subject to a deductible or could be excluded under the terms of the policy. Historically, the Company has not experienced any material product liability claims or regulatory actions.The Company’s businesses and operations are subject to regulation in the U.S. and abroad.Changes in laws, regulations and related interpretations may alter the environment in which the Company does business. This includes changes in environmental, data privacy, competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards, taxation and other 10regulations. Accordingly, regulatory, tax and legal contingencies (including environmental, human resource, product liability, patent and other intellectual property matters), should they exist in the future, could require the Company to record significant reserves or pay significant fines or damages during a reporting period, which could materially impact the Company’s results. In addition, new regulations may be enacted in the U.S. or abroad that may require the Company to incur additional personnel-related, environmental or other costs on an ongoing basis, significantly restrict the Company’s ability to sell certain products, or incur fines or penalties for noncompliance, any of which could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.As a U.S.-based multinational company, the Company is also subject to tax regulations in the U.S. and multiple foreign jurisdictions, some of which are interdependent. For example, certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the U.S. may not be taxed in the U.S. until those earnings are actually repatriated or deemed repatriated. If these or other tax regulations should change, the Company’s financial results could be impacted.Certain or our products and facilities are subject to regulation by the FDA and by analogous foreign regulators.The FDA requires us to register certain of our products and manufacturing facilities. The FDA also inspects these facilities and products to confirm compliance with its requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to comply with FDA requirements applicable to our current products and facilities or any product or facility we may establish in the future. The failure to address any concerns raised by the FDA could also lead to facility shutdown or the delay or withholding of product approval by the FDA, or product recalls, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditionThe Company is subject to environmental regulation and environmental risks.The Company is subject to national, state, provincial and/or local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations and prohibitions on the discharge and emission of, and establish standards for the use, disposal and management of, certain materials and waste. These environmental laws and regulations also impose liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up sites, and certain damages resulting from present and past spills, disposals, or other releases of hazardous substances or materials. Environmental laws and regulations can be complex and may change often. Capital and operating expenses required to comply with environmental laws and regulations can be significant, and violations may result in substantial fines and penalties. In addition, environmental laws and regulations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, in the United States impose liability on several grounds for the investigation and clean-up of contaminated soil, ground water and buildings and for damages to natural resources on a wide range of properties. For example, contamination at properties formerly owned or operated by the Company, as well as at properties it will own and operate, and properties to which hazardous substances were sent by the Company, may result in liability for the Company under environmental laws and regulations. The costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance, or liability with respect to contamination in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.Risks Related to Our Overseas OperationsThe Company’s operations are increasingly global in nature. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions in the countries in which we conduct business, by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and other factors related to our international operations.As our international operations and activities expand, we face increasing exposure to the risks of operating in foreign countries. These factors include: •Changes generally in political, regulatory or economic conditions in the countries in which we conduct business;  •Trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products, including government subsidies, tax benefits, changes in local tax rates, trade actions (such as anti-dumping proceedings) and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over the Company;  •Changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our competitive position, selling prices and manufacturing costs, and therefore the demand for our products in a particular market; and 11  •The duration, severity, spread and recurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic in foreign countries, including through variant strains of the underlying virus.These risks could affect the cost of manufacturing and selling our products, our pricing, sales volume, and ultimately our financial performance. The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on the Company vary from country to country and are unpredictable.Reliance on foreign suppliers could adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company sources its products from suppliers located in Asia, Europe and the United States. The Company’s Asia vendors are located primarily in China, which subjects the Company to various risks within the region including regulatory, political, economic and foreign currency changes, and, commencing in 2020 through the present, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company’s ability to continue to select and retain reliable vendors and suppliers who provide timely deliveries of quality products efficiently will impact its success in meeting customer demand for timely delivery of quality products. The Company’s sourcing operations and its vendors are impacted by labor costs in China. Labor historically has been readily available at low cost relative to labor costs in North America. However, labor costs have risen in some regions due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of rapid social, political and economic changes.  There can be no assurance that labor will continue to be available to the Company’s suppliers in China at costs consistent with historical levels or that changes in labor or other laws will not be enacted which would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations in China. Interruption to supplies from any of the Company’s vendors, or the loss of one or more key vendors, could have a negative effect on the Company’s business and operating results.Changes in currency exchange rates might negatively affect the profitability and business prospects of the Company and its overseas vendors. In particular, the Chinese Renminbi has increased against the U.S. Dollar during the last two years. If the Chinese Renminbi continues to increase with respect to the U.S. Dollar in the future, the Company may experience cost increases on such purchases, and this can adversely impact profitability. Future interventions by China may result in further currency appreciation and increase our product costs over time. The Company may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related effects of the product cost increases.Additional factors that could adversely affect the Company’s business in connection with its foreign suppliers include increases in transportation costs, new or increased import duties, transportation delays, work stoppages, capacity constraints and poor quality; the possibility that the Company might experience any of these factors has been increased by the COVID-19 pandemic.Continuing uncertainty in the global economy could negatively impact our business.Uncertainty in the global economy could adversely affect our customers and our suppliers and businesses such as ours. In addition, any uncertainty could have a variety of negative effects on the Company, such as reduction in revenues, increased costs, lower gross margin percentages, increased allowances for doubtful accounts and/or write-offs of accounts receivable and could otherwise have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Changes in trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and their enforcement, may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and outlook.In 2018, the United States levied tariffs on the import of some products from China, which is an important source of many of the Company’s products. To date these tariffs have affected folding and fixed blade knives; paper trimmers and rotary cutters; metal cutting shears; instruments for hand measuring as well as a wide range of components used in first aid kit production. In order to offset the impact of to these tariffs, the Company has implemented price increases on the affected products. Tariff levels may be further increased and the types of products subject to tariffs may be expanded. Although the Company intends to continue to pass additional price increases on to our customers, such tariff-related developments could have a negative impact on customer demand and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we might have to modify our current business practices, including potentially sourcing from alternative vendors, which could result in inefficiencies and delays in production and cause the Company to incur additional costs.Pandemic Related Risks 12 The economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken to arrest its spread, as well as measures we have taken and continue to take in response to the pandemic, could adversely impact our business, including our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.The outbreak and global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted economic activity and conditions worldwide and continues to impact our business operations. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue to impact our business is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the efficacy and public acceptance of vaccines, the spread of COVID-19 variants and the extent of federal, state, and local government responses affecting the economy. These impacts may include, but are not limited to: •Significant weakness, reductions or volatility in demand for one or more of our products, which have been and may in the future be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products, store closures, office closures, school closures or delayed opening for schools and other higher education programs, quarantine or other travel restrictions, or financial hardship among customers, retailers and consumers, shifts in demand away from one or more of our more discretionary or higher priced products to lower priced products, or prior stockpiling of goods; if prolonged, such impacts could further increase the difficulty in planning our operations, which, in turn, may adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition; •Difficult or inability in meeting our customers’ needs and achieving cost targets due to disruptions in our manufacturing operations, supply arrangements as well as distribution centers caused by the disruption of essential manufacturing and supply elements such as raw materials or other finished product components, transportation, workforce, or other manufacturing and distribution capability;  •Failure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, contractors, external business partners, and customers to meet their obligations to the Company, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties. Any such failure or disruption may adversely impact our operations, liquidity and financial condition; or  •Significant changes in the political and labor conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products, including quarantines, governmental or regulatory actions, safety protocols or restrictions that limit or close our facilities; restrict our employees’ ability or willingness to travel or perform necessary business functions, or otherwise prevent our facilities or our suppliers or customers from adequately staffing operations, including operations necessary for the production, distribution, sale, and support of our products, which could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business, our operations, or the global economy as a whole. Despite our efforts to manage and remedy these impacts to the Company, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, and depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control. In this regard, the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business, operating results, cash flows, liquidity and financial conditions will be primarily driven by the ultimate duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the U.S. and global economies.Vaccine mandates applicable to us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.OSHA issued an ETS in November 2021 that mandated either the full vaccination or weekly testing of employees for employers with 100 or more employees.  On January 13, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court re-imposed a previously ordered stay of the ETS and returned the case to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The majority of the Supreme Court held that the challengers to the ETS were likely to prevail on the merits because OSHA exceeded its statutory authority. While the Supreme Court’s ruling enjoined OSHA from imposing its mandate, the ruling has no impact on the ability of private employers to impose their own vaccine mandate. On January 25, 2022, OSHA announced it was withdrawing the ETS as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling.   However, any additional vaccine mandates, or the requirement for employees to receive vaccine booster doses, may be announced in other jurisdictions in which our businesses operate. Our implementation of existing or additional vaccine mandates may result in attrition, including attrition of critically skilled labor, and difficulty securing future labor needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Risks Related to Our Common Stock13We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to pay dividends or purchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs.We continue to pay and declare dividends on a quarterly basis and we anticipate that we will continue to do so. However, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash or surplus under applicable law to be able to continue to pay dividends at our current level or purchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. This may result from extraordinary cash expenses, actual expenses exceeding contemplated costs, funding of capital expenditures, increases in reserves or lack of available capital. We may also suspend the payment of dividends or our stock repurchase program if the Board deems such action to be in the best interests of our shareholders. If we do not pay dividends or decrease the amount of dividends we pay, the price of our common stock would likely decrease. At December 31, 2021, a total of 160,365 shares may be purchased in the future under the repurchase program which the Company announced in 2019.Our shares of common stock are thinly traded and our stock price may be volatile.Because our common stock is thinly traded, its market price may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market in general or the stock prices of other companies listed on major stock exchanges. There were approximately 3,098,053 shares of our common stock held by non-affiliates as of December 31, 2021. Thus, our common stock is less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and, as a result, the trading price for shares of our common stock may be more volatile. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price for our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger"
12,ACU,ACME UNITED CORP,2021-03-31,"Risk Factors
Ownership of the Company’s securities involves a number of risks and uncertainties. Potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before deciding whether to invest in the Company’s securities. The Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The risks described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks that are currently unknown to the Company or that the Company currently considers immaterial may also impair its business or adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations.Industry and Operational RisksThe Company is subject to a number of significant operational risks that might cause the Company’s actual results to vary materially from its forecasts, targets or projections, including: •achieving planned revenue and profit growth in each of the Company's business segments; •changes in customer requirements and in the volume of sales to principal customers; •the ability of the Company to anticipate timing of orders and shipments particularly in the ecommerce area; •emergence of new competitors or consolidation of existing competitors; and •industry demand fluctuations.The Company’s expectations for both short and long-term future net revenues are based on the Company’s estimates of future demand. Orders from the Company’s principal customers are ultimately based on demand from end-users and end-user demand can be difficult to predict. During the prior year, as a result of the COVID pandemic, the Company had difficulty in forecasting demand for its products. Low end-user demand would negatively affect orders the Company receives from distributors and other principal customers which could, in turn adversely affect the Company’s revenues in any fiscal period. If the Company’s estimates of sales are not accurate and the Company experiences unforeseen variability in its revenues and operating results, the Company may be unable to adjust its expense levels accordingly and its profit margins could be adversely affected.  6We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, as described below.  A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In connection with the preparation of our annual report for the year ended December 31, 2020, we identified a deficiency related to the Company’s inventory cycle count program at our Rocky Mount, NC warehouse (the Warehouse).  Specifically, the Company’s controls related to the existence of inventory at the Warehouse were not effective as the cycle count program used did not demonstrate inventory quantities were sufficiently counted.  We have evaluated the processes, procedures and controls related to the Warehouse cycle count program and have commenced making changes as considered appropriate to address the control deficiency. We are in the process of implementing a new inventory management system and are allocating additional resources to the implementation of our inventory cycle count program.  The actions deemed taken are subject to continued review, supported by monitoring and testing by management as well as audit committee oversight.  If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner may be materially adversely affected and investor confidence in the Company may be negatively impacted.Because our products are primarily sold by third parties, our financial results depend in part on the financial health of these parties and any loss of a third-party distributor could adversely affect the Company’s revenues.A large majority of the Company’s products are sold through third-party distributors and large retailers. Some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products. Changes in the financial or business conditions or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could affect our sales and profitability. Additionally, no assurances can be given that any or all of such distributors or retailers will continue their relationships with the Company. Distributors and other significant retail customers cannot easily be replaced and the loss of revenues and the Company’s inability to reduce expenses to compensate for the loss of revenues could adversely affect the Company’s net revenues and profit margins. The ability to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner and to satisfy our customers’ fulfillment standards are subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control.  These factors presently include the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company.Customers place great emphasis on timely delivery of our products for specific selling seasons, especially during our second and third fiscal quarters, and on the fulfillment of consumer demand throughout the year. We cannot control all of the various factors that might affect product delivery to customers. Vendor production delays, cybersecurity attacks on our vendors, difficulties encountered in shipping from overseas and customs clearance delays are on-going risks of our business. We also rely upon third-party carriers for our product shipments from our distribution centers to customers. Accordingly, we are subject to risks, including labor disputes, inclement weather, natural disasters, cybersecurity attacks, possible acts of terrorism, availability of shipping containers, and increased security restrictions associated with such carriers’ ability to provide delivery services to meet our shipping needs.  In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused disruptions in our supply chain as a result of shortages of factory workers, travel restrictions, barriers to the movement of goods, and temporary closures of production facilities and distribution centers.  Failure to deliver products to our customers in a timely and effective manner, often under special vendor requirements to use specific carriers and delivery schedules, could damage our reputation and brands and result in loss of customers or reduced orders.The Company’s business is subject to risks associated with seasonality which could adversely affect its cash flow, financial condition, or results of operations.The Company’s business, historically, has experienced higher sales volume in the second and third quarters of the calendar year, when compared to the first and fourth quarters. The Company is a major supplier of products related to the “back-to-school” season, which occurs principally during the months of May through August. If this typical seasonal increase in sales of certain portions of the Company’s product line does not materialize in any year for any reason, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company could experience a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.Failure to manage growth and continue to expand our operations successfully could adversely affect our financial results.Our business has experienced significant historical growth over the years including through two new strategic acquisitions in 2020. We expect our business to continue to grow organically and through strategic acquisitions both domestically and internationally. This growth places significant demands on management and operational systems. If we cannot effectively manage our growth, we would likely experience operational inefficiencies and incur unanticipated costs, thus negatively impacting our operating results. To the extent we grow through strategic acquisitions, our success will depend on selecting the appropriate targets, integrating such acquisitions quickly and effectively and realizing any expected synergies and cost savings related to such acquisitions.7Unfavorable shifts in industry-wide demand for the Company’s products could result in inventory valuation risk.The Company evaluates its ending inventories for excess quantities, impairment of value, and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand based upon input received from our customers, sales team, and management. If inventories on hand are in excess of demand or slow moving, appropriate write-downs may be recorded. In addition, the Company might have to write off inventories that are considered obsolete based upon changes in customer demand, product design changes, or new product introductions, which eliminate demand for existing products. Historically, the Company has not had to write down or write off product inventories. Loss of a major customer could result in a decrease in the Company’s future sales and earnings.Sales of our products are primarily concentrated in a few major customers including office product superstores and mass market distributors. The Company had two customers in 2020 and one customer in 2019 that individually exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales. Net sales to those customers were approximately 18% and 13% in 2020 and 17% in 2019, respectively. The Company anticipates that a limited number of customers may account for a substantial portion of its total net revenues for the foreseeable future. The business risks associated with this concentration, including increased credit risks for these and other customers and the possibility of related bad debt write-offs, could negatively affect our margins and profits. Additionally, the loss of a major customer, whether through competition or consolidation, or a disruption in sales to such a customer, could result in a decrease of the Company’s future sales and earnings.The loss of key management could adversely affect the Company’s ability to run its business.The Company’s success depends, to a large extent, on the continued service of its executive management team, operating officers and other key personnel. The Company must therefore continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and operating personnel sufficient to maintain its current business and support its projected growth. The Company’s inability to meet its staffing requirements in the future could adversely affect its results of operations.Execution or the lack thereof, of our e-commerce business may reduce our operating results.Our e-commerce business constituted approximately 16% of our net sales in 2020 and has been our fastest growing distribution channel over the last several years. The continued successful growth of our e-commerce business depends, in part, on third parties and factors over which we have limited control, including difficulty forecasting demand, changing consumer preferences, and e-commerce buying trends, both domestically and abroad, as well as promotional or other advertising initiatives employed by our customers or other third parties on their e-commerce sites. Additionally, sales in our e-commerce distribution channel may also divert sales from our other customers. Additionally, the success of our e-commerce business depends, in part, on the timely receipt of our products by our customers and their end users. The efficient flow of our products requires that our distribution facilities have adequate capacity to support increases in our e-commerce business. If we encounter difficulties with forecasting demand and supply to our distribution facilities, we could face shortages of inventory, resulting in “out of stock” conditions in the e-commerce sites operated by our customers or other third parties, and we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers.Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties might adversely affect the sales in our e-commerce business, as well as damage our brands.The Company is subject to intense competition in all of the markets in which it competes.The Company’s products are sold in highly competitive markets including at mass merchants, high volume office supply stores and online. The Company believes that the principal points of competition in these markets are product innovation, quality, price, merchandising, design and engineering capabilities, product development, timeliness and completeness of delivery, conformity to customer specifications and post-sale support. Competitive conditions may require the Company to match or better competitors’ prices to retain business or market shares. The Company believes that its competitive position will depend on continued investment in innovation and product development, manufacturing and sourcing, quality standards, marketing and customer service and support. The Company’s success will depend in part on its ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various market categories in which it competes. The Company may not have sufficient resources to make the investments that may be necessary to anticipate those changing needs and the Company may not anticipate, identify, develop and market products successfully or otherwise be successful in maintaining its competitive position. In addition, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in successfully developing and commercializing innovative new products on a continuing basis, and new product launches may not provide expected growth results. There are no significant barriers to entry into the markets for most of the Company’s products.Compromises of our information systems or unauthorized access to confidential information or our customers' or associates' personal information may materially harm our business or damage our reputation.Through our sales and marketing activities and our business operations, we collect and store confidential information and certain personal information from our customers and associates. We also process payment card information and check information. In addition, in the normal course of business, we gather and retain personal information about our associates and generate and have access to confidential business information. Although we have taken steps designed to safeguard such information, there can be no assurance that such information will be 8protected against unauthorized access or disclosure. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our or our vendors' network security and, if successful, misappropriate such information. An employee of the Company, contractor or other third-party with whom we do business may also attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. We could be subject to liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws, for failing to protect personal information, or for misusing personal information, such as use of such information for an unauthorized marketing purpose. Any compromise of our systems or data could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and expose us to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, employees, and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The Company may not be able to maintain or to raise prices in response to increasing costs or inflation.Future market and competitive pressures may prohibit the Company from raising prices to offset increased product costs, shipping costs and other inflationary items, whether due to increases in the costs of raw materials or components or to the COVID-19 pandemic, or to offset currency fluctuations. The inability to pass these costs through to the Company’s customers could have a negative effect on its results of operations.The Company may need to raise additional capital to fund its operations.The Company’s management believes that, under current conditions, the Company’s current cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by operations, together with the borrowing availability under its revolving loan agreement with HSBC Bank N.A., will be sufficient to fund planned operations for the next twelve months from the issuance date of this report. However, if the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, it may be required to find additional funding sources. If adequate financing is unavailable or is unavailable on acceptable terms, the Company may be unable to maintain, develop or enhance its operations, products, and services, take advantage of future opportunities or adequately respond to competitive pressures.Changes in interest rates could adversely affect us.We have exposure to increases in interest rates under our revolving credit loan agreement with HSBC Bank, N.A. which presently bears interest at the Prime Rate less 1.25%.  In response to the last global economic recession, actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banking institutions were taken to create and maintain a low interest rate environment. Increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs on our variable-rate debt as well as any future fixed rate debt. Any increase in the interest which we pay would reduce our cash available for working capital, acquisitions, and other uses.Legal and Regulatory RisksFailure to protect the Company’s proprietary rights or the costs of protecting these rights could adversely affect its business.The Company’s success depends in part on its ability to obtain patents and trademarks and to preserve other intellectual property rights covering its products and processes. The Company has obtained certain domestic and foreign patents and intends to continue to seek patents on its inventions when appropriate. The process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that pending patents related to any of the Company’s products will be issued, in which case the Company may not be able to legally prevent others from producing similar and/or compatible competing products. If other companies were to sell similar and/or compatible competing products, the Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the Company’s efforts to protect its intellectual property will be successful. Any infringement of the Company’s intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on the Company.If the Company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or cannot obtain necessary intellectual property rights from others, its competitiveness could be negatively impaired.If the Company is found to have violated the trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, including through the use of third-party marks, ideas, or technologies, such a finding could result in the need to cease use of such mark, trade secret, copyrighted work or patented invention in the Company’s business, as well as the obligation to pay for past infringement. If rights holders are willing to permit the Company to continue to use such intellectual property rights, they could require a payment of a substantial amount for continued use of those rights. Either ceasing use or paying such amounts could cause the Company to become less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.Even if the Company is not found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, claims of infringement could adversely affect the Company’s business. The Company could incur significant legal costs and related expenses to defend against such claims, and the Company could incur significant costs associated with discontinuing to use, provide, or manufacture certain products, services or trademarks even if it is ultimately found not to have infringed such rights.Product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect the Company's financial results and reputation.Claims for losses or injuries allegedly caused by some of the Company’s products could arise in the ordinary course of its business. In addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments, product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the Company’s reputation in the marketplace or the value of its brands. The Company also could be required to recall possible defective products, which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although the Company maintains product liability insurance 9coverage, potential product liability claims are subject to a deductible or could be excluded under the terms of the policy. Historically, the Company has not experienced product liability claims or regulatory actions.The Company’s businesses and operations are subject to regulation in the U.S. and abroad.Changes in laws, regulations and related interpretations may alter the environment in which the Company does business. This includes changes in environmental, data privacy, competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards, taxation and other regulations. Accordingly, regulatory, tax and legal contingencies (including environmental, human resource, product liability, patent and other intellectual property matters), should they exist in the future, could require the Company to record significant reserves or pay significant fines or damages during a reporting period, which could materially impact the Company’s results. In addition, new regulations may be enacted in the U.S. or abroad that may require the Company to incur additional personnel-related, environmental or other costs on an ongoing basis, significantly restrict the Company’s ability to sell certain products, or incur fines or penalties for noncompliance, any of which could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.As a U.S.-based multinational company, the Company is also subject to tax regulations in the U.S. and multiple foreign jurisdictions, some of which are interdependent. For example, certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the U.S. may not be taxed in the U.S. until those earnings are actually repatriated or deemed repatriated. If these or other tax regulations should change, the Company’s financial results could be impacted.Certain or our products and facilities are subject to regulation by the FDA and by analogous foreign regulators.The FDA requires us to register certain of our products and manufacturing facilities. The FDA also inspects these facilities and products to confirm compliance with its requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to comply with FDA requirements applicable to our current products and facilities or any product or facility we may establish in the future. The failure to address any concerns raised by the FDA could also lead to facility shutdown or the delay or withholding of product approval by the FDA, or product recalls, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditionThe Company is subject to environmental regulation and environmental risks.The Company is subject to national, state, provincial and/or local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations and prohibitions on the discharge and emission of, and establish standards for the use, disposal and management of, certain materials and waste. These environmental laws and regulations also impose liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up sites, and certain damages resulting from present and past spills, disposals, or other releases of hazardous substances or materials. Environmental laws and regulations can be complex and may change often. Capital and operating expenses required to comply with environmental laws and regulations can be significant, and violations may result in substantial fines and penalties. In addition, environmental laws and regulations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, in the United States impose liability on several grounds for the investigation and clean-up of contaminated soil, ground water and buildings and for damages to natural resources on a wide range of properties. For example, contamination at properties formerly owned or operated by the Company, as well as at properties it will own and operate, and properties to which hazardous substances were sent by the Company, may result in liability for the Company under environmental laws and regulations. The costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance, or liability with respect to contamination in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.Risks Related to Our Overseas OperationsReliance on foreign suppliers could adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company sources its products from suppliers located in Asia, Europe and the United States. The Company’s Asia vendors are located primarily in China, which subjects the Company to various risks within the region including regulatory, political, economic and foreign currency changes, and, commencing in 2020, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company’s ability to continue to select and retain reliable vendors and suppliers who provide timely deliveries of quality products efficiently will impact its success in meeting customer demand for timely delivery of quality products. The Company’s sourcing operations and its vendors are impacted by labor costs in China. Labor historically has been readily available at low cost relative to labor costs in North America. However, as China is experiencing rapid social, political and economic changes, labor costs have risen in some regions and there can be no assurance that labor will continue to be available to the Company’s suppliers in China at costs consistent with historical levels or that changes in labor or other laws will not be enacted which would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations in China. Interruption of supplies from any of the Company’s vendors, or the loss of one or more key vendors, could have a negative effect on the Company’s business and operating results.Changes in currency exchange rates might negatively affect the profitability and business prospects of the Company and its overseas vendors. In particular, the Chinese Renminbi has recently fluctuated against the U.S. Dollar. If the Chinese Renminbi continues to fluctuate with respect to the U.S. Dollar in the future, the Company may experience cost increases on such purchases, and this can adversely impact profitability. Future interventions by China may result in further currency appreciation and increase our product costs over time.  The Company may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related effects of the product cost increases.10Additional factors that could adversely affect the Company’s business include increases in transportation costs, new or increased import duties, transportation delays, work stoppages, capacity constraints and poor quality; the possibility that the Company might experience any of these factors has been increased by the COVID-19 pandemic.The Company’s operations are increasingly global in nature. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions in the countries in which we conduct business, by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and other factors related to our international operations.As our international operations and activities expand, we face increasing exposure to the risks of operating in foreign countries. These factors include: •Changes generally in political, regulatory or economic conditions in the countries in which we conduct business; •Trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products, including government subsidies, tax benefits, changes in local tax rates, trade actions (such as anti-dumping proceedings) and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over the Company; •Changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our competitive position, selling prices and manufacturing costs, and therefore the demand for our products in a particular market; and •The duration, severity, spread and recurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic in foreign countries, including through variant strains of the underlying virus.These risks could affect the cost of manufacturing and selling our products, our pricing, sales volume, and ultimately our financial performance. The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on the Company vary from country to country and are unpredictable.Continuing uncertainty in the global economy could negatively impact our business.Uncertainty in the global economy could adversely affect our customers and our suppliers and businesses such as ours. In addition, any uncertainty could have a variety of negative effects on the Company, such as reduction in revenues, increased costs, lower gross margin percentages, increased allowances for doubtful accounts and/or write-offs of accounts receivable and could otherwise have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Changes in trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and their enforcement, may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and outlook. In 2018, the United States levied tariffs on the import of some products from China, which is an important source of many of the Company’s products. To date these tariffs have affected folding and fixed blade knives; paper trimmers and rotary cutters; metal cutting shears; instruments for hand measuring as well as a wide range of components used in first aid kit production.   In order to offset the impact of to these tariffs, the Company has implemented price increases on the affected products. Tariff levels may be further increased and the types of products subject to tariffs may be expanded. Although the Company intends to continue to pass additional price increases on to our customers, such tariff-related developments could have a negative impact on customer demand and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we might have to modify our current business practices, including potentially sourcing from alternative vendors, which could result in inefficiencies and delays in production and cause the Company to incur additional costs.Pandemic Related Risks The economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken to arrest its spread, as well as any emergency measures we have taken and continue to take in response to the pandemic, could adversely impact our business, including our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.The outbreak and global spread of COVID-19, which has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, has adversely impacted economic activity and conditions worldwide and is currently impacting our business operations. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue to impact our business is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the efficacy and availability of vaccines, the spread of COVID-19 variants and the extent of federal, state, and local government responses affecting the economy. These impacts include, but are not limited to:  •Significant weakness, reductions or volatility in demand for one or more of our products, which have been and may in the future be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products store closures, office closures, school closures or delayed opening for schools and other higher education programs, quarantine or other travel restrictions, or financial hardship among customers, retailers and consumers, shifts in demand away from one or more of our more discretionary or higher priced products to lower priced products, or prior stockpiling of goods; if prolonged, such impacts can further increase the difficulty in planning our operations, which may adversely impact our results, liquidity and financial condition; 11  •Inability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets due to disruptions in our manufacturing operations, supply arrangements as well as distribution centers caused by the disruption of essential manufacturing and supply elements such as raw materials or other finished product components, transportation, workforce, or other manufacturing and distribution capability;  •Failure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, contractors, commercial banks, external business partners, and customers to meet their obligations to the Company, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties. Any such failure or disruption may adversely impact our operations, liquidity and financial condition; or  •Significant changes in the political and labor conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products, including quarantines, governmental or regulatory actions, safety protocols or restrictions that limit or close our facilities; restrict our employees’ ability or willingness to travel or perform necessary business functions, or otherwise prevent our facilities or our suppliers or customers from sufficiently staffing operations, including operations necessary for the production, distribution, sale, and support of our products, which could adversely impact our results, liquidity and financial condition.The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business, our operations, or the global economy as a whole. Despite our efforts to manage and remedy these impacts to the Company, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, and depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control. In this regard, the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business, operating results, cash flows, liquidity and financial conditions will be primarily driven by the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, its impact on the U.S. and global economies and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental plans to administer vaccines to the general public, especially in areas where conditions have recently worsened and lockdowns or travel bans have been reinstituted.The Small Business Association’s review of our forgiveness application is ongoing and it is possible that our PPP Loan may not be forgiven.On May 7, 2020, the Company received a loan (the “PPP Loan”) from HSBC Bank, N.A. in the amount of $3,508,047 under the Paycheck Protection Program established by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act.  All or a portion of the PPP Loan may be eligible to be forgiven by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) and the lender upon application by the Company, provided that the Company shall have used the loan proceeds for eligible purposes, including the payment of payroll, benefits, rent, mortgage interest and utilities, during the 24-week period beginning on the date of funding of the loan (the “covered period”).  Not more than 40% of the amount forgiven may be for non-payroll costs.  The PPP loan application required us to certify, among other things, that the then current economic uncertainty made the PPP loan request necessary to support our ongoing operations. While we made this certification in good faith, the required certification is not based on any specific objective criteria and is subject to interpretation. In early 2020, the SBA provided guidance that it would be unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets would be able to make the required certification in good faith, and such company should be prepared to demonstrate to the SBA, upon request, the basis for its certification. Further, the Secretary of the Treasury and the SBA Administrator announced that the government will conduct a full audit of all PPP loans of more than $2 million for which the borrower applies for forgiveness. While we believe that we have satisfied all eligibility requirements for the PPP loan, there is a risk that we may be deemed ineligible to have received the PPP loan or in violation of any of the laws or governmental regulations that apply to us in connection with the PPP loan. In such event, we may be required to repay the PPP loan in its entirety, and we could be subject to additional penalties.  The SBA reserves the right to audit any PPP loan, regardless of size. These audits may occur after forgiveness has been granted. Under the CARES Act, all borrowers are required to maintain their loan documentation for six years after the PPP loan was forgiven or repaid in full and to provide that documentation to the SBA upon request. 12 Risks Related to Our Common StockWe cannot provide assurance that we will continue to pay dividends or purchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs.We continue to pay and declare dividends on a quarterly basis and we anticipate that we will continue to do so. However, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash or surplus under the law to be able to continue to pay dividends at our current level or purchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. At December 31, 2020, a total of 203,579 shares may be purchased in the future under the repurchase programs which the Company announced in 2010 and 2019. This may result from extraordinary cash expenses, actual expenses exceeding contemplated costs, funding of capital expenditures, increases in reserves or lack of available capital. We may also suspend the payment of dividends or our stock repurchase program if the Board deems such action to be in the best interests of our shareholders. If we do not pay dividends or decrease the amount of dividends we pay, the price of our common stock would likely decrease.Our shares of common stock are thinly traded and our stock price may be volatile.Because our common stock is thinly traded, its market price may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market in general or the stock prices of other companies listed on major stock exchanges. There were approximately 2,916,940 shares of our common stock held by non-affiliates as of December 31, 2020. Thus, our common stock is less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and, as a result, the trading price for shares of our common stock may be more volatile. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price for our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger"
2,ACU,ACME UNITED CORP,2020-03-13,"Risk Factors
The Company is subject to a number of significant operational risks that might cause the Company’s actual results to vary materially from its forecasts, targets or projections, including: •achieving planned revenue and profit growth in each of the Company's business segments; •changes in customer requirements and in the volume of sales to principal customers; •the ability of the Company to anticipate timing of orders and shipments particularly in the ecommerce area; •emergence of new competitors or consolidation of existing competitors; and •industry demand fluctuations.5 The Company’s expectations for both short and long-term future net revenues are based on the Company’s estimates of future demand. Orders from the Company’s principal customers are ultimately based on demand from end-users and end-user demand can be difficult to predict. Low end-user demand would negatively affect orders the Company receives from distributors and other principal customers which could, in turn adversely affect the Company’s revenues in any fiscal period. If the Company’s estimates of sales are not accurate and the Company experiences unforeseen variability in its revenues and operating results, the Company may be unable to adjust its expense levels accordingly and its profit margins could be adversely affected.Because our products are primarily sold by third parties, our financial results depend in part on the financial health of these parties and any loss of a third party distributor could adversely affect the Company’s revenues.A large majority of the Company’s products are sold through third-party distributors and large retailers. Some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products. Changes in the financial or business conditions or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could affect our sales and profitability.Additionally, no assurances can be given that any or all of such distributors or retailers will continue their relationships with the Company. Distributors and other significant retail customers cannot easily be replaced and the loss of revenues and the Company’s inability to reduce expenses to compensate for the loss of revenues could adversely affect the Company’s net revenues and profit margins. The ability to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner and to satisfy our customers’ fulfillment standards are subject to several factors, some of which are beyond our control.Customers place great emphasis on timely delivery of our products for specific selling seasons, especially during our second and third fiscal quarters, and on the fulfillment of consumer demand throughout the year. We cannot control all of the various factors that might affect product delivery to customers. Vendor production delays, cybersecurity attacks on our vendors, difficulties encountered in shipping from overseas and customs clearance delays are on-going risks of our business. We also rely upon third-party carriers for our product shipments from our distribution centers to customers. Accordingly, we are subject to risks, including labor disputes, inclement weather, natural disasters, cybersecurity attacks, possible acts of terrorism, availability of shipping containers, and increased security restrictions associated with such carriers’ ability to provide delivery services to meet our shipping needs.  Failure to deliver products to our customers in a timely and effective manner, often under special vendor requirements to use specific carriers and delivery schedules, could damage our reputation and brands and result in loss of customers or reduced orders.Reliance on foreign suppliers could adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company sources its products from suppliers located in Asia, Europe and the United States. The Company’s Asia vendors are located primarily in China, which subjects the Company to various risks within the region including regulatory, political, economic and foreign currency changes. The Company’s ability to select and retain reliable vendors and suppliers who provide timely deliveries of quality products efficiently will impact its success in meeting customer demand for timely delivery of quality products. The Company’s sourcing operations and its vendors are impacted by labor costs in China. Labor historically has been readily available at low cost relative to labor costs in North America. However, as China is experiencing rapid social, political and economic changes, labor costs have risen in some regions and there can be no assurance that labor will continue to be available to the Company in China at costs consistent with historical levels or that changes in labor or other laws will not be enacted which would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations in China. Interruption of supplies from any of the Company’s vendors, or the loss of one or more key vendors, could have a negative effect on the Company’s business and operating results.Changes in currency exchange rates might negatively affect the profitability and business prospects of the Company and its overseas vendors. In particular, the Chinese Renminbi has recently fluctuated against the U.S. Dollar, if the Chinese Renminbi continues to fluctuate with respect to the U.S. Dollar in the future, the Company may experience cost increases on such purchases, and this can adversely impact profitability. Future interventions by China may result in further currency appreciation and increase our product costs over time.  The Company may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related effects of the product cost increases.Additional factors that could adversely affect the Company’s business include increases in transportation costs, new or increased import duties, transportation delays, work stoppages, capacity constraints and poor quality.The Company’s operations are increasingly global in nature. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions in the countries in which we conduct business, by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and other factors related to our international operations.As our international operations and activities expand, we face increasing exposure to the risks of operating in foreign countries. These factors include: •Changes generally in political, regulatory or economic conditions in the countries in which we conduct business. •Trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products, including government subsidies, tax benefits, changes in local tax rates, trade actions (such as anti-dumping proceedings) and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over the Company. •Changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our competitive position, selling prices and manufacturing costs, and therefore the demand for our products in a particular market.6 These risks could affect the cost of manufacturing and selling our products, our pricing, sales volume, and ultimately our financial performance. The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on the Company vary from country to country and are unpredictable. The Coronavirus could materially adversely affect our resultsIf a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease occurs, our business may be adversely affected. For example, in December 2019, a new strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) spread through China as well as other countries including the United States and countries in Europe, bringing the total to at least 100 countries worldwide with confirmed cases of COVID-19. The impact of the virus varies from region to region and from day to day and any significant additional spreading of the virus could adversely affect the Company’s business.  At the time of this filing, COVID-19 has not caused significant disruption in the Company’s business and the Company currently has sufficient inventory to meet anticipated demands in the near future.  However, the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus is likely to have a further negative impact in 2020 on the global economy and, in the future, might impact the Company’s ability to manufacture, source or distribute its products both domestically and internationally or reduce demand for its products, any of which could have a significant negative impact on the Company’s financial results in 2020 and beyond. Given the dynamic nature of this outbreak, however, the extent to which the COVID-19 virus impacts the Company’s results will depend on future developments, which remain highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.Continuing uncertainty in the global economy could negatively impact our business.Uncertainty in the global economy could adversely affect our customers and our suppliers and businesses such as ours. In addition, any uncertainty could have a variety of negative effects on the Company, such as reduction in revenues, increased costs, lower gross margin percentages, increased allowances for doubtful accounts and/or write-offs of accounts receivable and could otherwise have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Changes in trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and their enforcement, may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and outlook.On September 24, 2018, the United States levied a third round of tariffs on the import of some products from China, which is an important source of many of the Company’s products. The first two rounds targeted $50 billion of Chinese goods and applied a 25% tariff; these rounds had no impact on the Company. The third round targeted an additional $200 billion of Chinese goods and applied a 10% tariff that was scheduled to increase to 25% at the start of 2019 but has been delayed. This latest round affects approximately 10% of the Company’s product purchases and will increase our costs of procurement. These tariffs affect certain measuring products, folding knives and first aid components. In response to these tariffs, the Company has implemented a price increase on the affected products in order to offset their impact. Tariff levels may be further increased and the types of products subject to tariffs may be expanded. Although the Company intends to pass additional price increases on to our customers, such tariff-related developments could have a negative impact on customer demand and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we might have to modify our current business practices, including potentially sourcing from alternative vendors.The Company’s business is subject to risks associated with seasonality which could adversely affect its cash flow, financial condition, or results of operations.The Company’s business, historically, has experienced higher sales volume in the second and third quarters of the calendar year, when compared to the first and fourth quarters. The Company is a major supplier of products related to the “back-to-school” season, which occurs principally during the months of May through August. If this typical seasonal increase in sales of certain portions of the Company’s product line does not materialize in any year, the Company could experience a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.Failure to manage growth and continue to expand our operations successfully could adversely affect our financial results.Our business has experienced significant historical growth over the years, and we expect our business to continue to grow organically and through strategic acquisitions. This growth places significant demands on management and operational systems. If we cannot effectively manage our growth, it is likely to result in operational inefficiencies and ineffective management of our business thus negatively impacting our operating results. To the extent we grow through strategic acquisitions, our success will depend on selecting the appropriate targets, integrating such acquisitions quickly and effectively and realizing any expected synergies and cost savings related to such acquisitions.7 Loss of a major customer could result in a decrease in the Company’s future sales and earnings.Sales of our products are primarily concentrated in a few major customers including office product superstores and mass market distributors. The Company had one customer in 2019 and 2018 that individually exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales. Net sales to this one customer were approximately 17% and 16% of consolidated net sales in 2019 and 2018, respectively.  The Company anticipates that a limited number of customers may account for a substantial portion of its total net revenues for the foreseeable future. The business risks associated with this concentration, including increased credit risks for these and other customers and the possibility of related bad debt write-offs, could negatively affect our margins and profits. Additionally, the loss of a major customer, whether through competition or consolidation, or a disruption in sales to such a customer, could result in a decrease of the Company’s future sales and earnings.The loss of key management could adversely affect the Company’s ability to run its business.The Company’s success depends, to a large extent, on the continued service of its executive management team, operating officers and other key personnel. The Company must therefore continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and operating personnel sufficient to maintain its current business and support its projected growth. The Company’s inability to meet its staffing requirements in the future could adversely affect its results of operations.Execution or the lack thereof, of our e-commerce business may reduce our operating results.Our e-commerce business constituted approximately 12% of our net sales in 2019 and has been our fastest growing distribution channel over the last several years. The continued successful growth of our e-commerce business depends, in part, on third parties and factors over which we have limited control, including difficulty forecasting demand, changing consumer preferences, and e-commerce buying trends, both domestically and abroad, as well as promotional or other advertising initiatives employed by our customers or other third parties on their e-commerce sites.  Additionally, sales in our e-commerce distribution channel may also divert sales from our other customers. Additionally, the success of our e-commerce business depends, in part, on the timely receipt of our products by our customers and their end users. The efficient flow of our products requires that our distribution facilities have adequate capacity to support increases in our e-commerce business. If we encounter difficulties with forecasting and supply to our distribution facilities, we could face shortages of inventory, resulting in “out of stock” conditions in the e-commerce sites operated by our customers or other third parties, and we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers.Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties might adversely affect the sales in our e-commerce business, as well as damage our brands.Failure to protect the Company’s proprietary rights or the costs of protecting these rights could adversely affect its business.The Company’s success depends in part on its ability to obtain patents and trademarks and to preserve other intellectual property rights covering its products and processes. The Company has obtained certain domestic and foreign patents and intends to continue to seek patents on its inventions when appropriate. The process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that pending patents related to any of the Company’s products will be issued, in which case the Company may not be able to legally prevent others from producing similar and/or compatible competing products. If other companies were to sell similar and/or compatible competing products, the Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the Company’s efforts to protect its intellectual property will be successful. Any infringement of the Company’s intellectual property or legal defence of such action could have a material adverse effect on the Company.The Company is subject to intense competition in all of the markets in which it competes.The Company’s products are sold in highly competitive markets including at mass merchants, high volume office supply stores and online. The Company believes that the principal points of competition in these markets are product innovation, quality, price, merchandising, design and engineering capabilities, product development, timeliness and completeness of delivery, conformity to customer specifications and post-sale support. Competitive conditions may require the Company to match or better competitors’ prices to retain business or market shares. The Company believes that its competitive position will depend on continued investment in innovation and product development, manufacturing and sourcing, quality standards, marketing and customer service and support. The Company’s success will depend in part on its ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various market categories in which it competes. The Company may not have sufficient resources to make the investments that may be necessary to anticipate those changing needs and the Company may not anticipate, identify, develop and market products successfully or otherwise be successful in maintaining its competitive position. In addition, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in successfully developing and commercializing innovative new products on a continuing basis, and new product launches may not provide expected growth results. There are no significant barriers to entry into the markets for most of the Company’s products.8 Compromises of our information systems or unauthorized access to confidential information or our customers' or associates' personal information may materially harm our business or damage our reputation.Through our sales and marketing activities and our business operations, we collect and store confidential information and certain personal information from our customers and associates. We also process payment card information and check information. In addition, in the normal course of business, we gather and retain personal information about our associates and generate and have access to confidential business information. Although we have taken steps designed to safeguard such information, there can be no assurance that such information will be protected against unauthorized access or disclosure. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our or our vendors' network security and, if successful, misappropriate such information. An Acme United associate, contractor or other third-party with whom we do business may also attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. We could be subject to liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws, for failing to protect personal information, or for misusing personal information, such as use of such information for an unauthorized marketing purpose. Any compromise of our systems or data could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and expose us to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, employees and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The Company may not be able to maintain or to raise prices in response to inflation and increasing costs.Future market and competitive pressures may prohibit the Company from raising prices to offset increased product costs, freight costs and other inflationary items or to offset currency fluctuations. The inability to pass these costs through to the Company’s customers could have a negative effect on its results of operations.The Company may need to raise additional capital to fund its operations.The Company’s management believes that, under current conditions, the Company’s current cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by operations, together with the borrowing availability under its revolving loan agreement with HSBC Bank N.A., will be sufficient to fund planned operations for the next twelve months from the issuance date of this report. However, if the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, it may be required to find additional funding sources. If adequate financing is unavailable or is unavailable on acceptable terms, the Company may be unable to maintain, develop or enhance its operations, products and services, take advantage of future opportunities or adequately respond to competitive pressures.Changes in interest rates could adversely affect us.We have exposure to increases in interest rates under our revolving credit loan agreement with HSBC Bank, N.A. which presently bears interest at the Prime Rate less 1.25%.  In response to the last global economic recession, actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banking institutions, were taken to create and maintain a low interest rate environment. Increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs on our variable-rate debt as well as any future fixed rate debt, we may incur at higher interest rates, and interest which we pay reduces our cash available for working capital, acquisitions, and other uses.Product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect the Company's financial results and reputation.Claims for losses or injuries allegedly caused by some of the Company’s products arise in the ordinary course of its business. In addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments, product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the Company’s reputation in the marketplace or the value of its brands. The Company also could be required to recall possible defective products, which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although the Company maintains product liability insurance coverage, potential product liability claims are subject to a deductible or could be excluded under the terms of the policy.The Company is subject to environmental regulation and environmental risks.The Company is subject to national, state, provincial and/or local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations and prohibitions on the discharge and emission of, and establish standards for the use, disposal and management of, certain materials and waste. These environmental laws and regulations also impose liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up sites, and certain damages resulting from present and past spills, disposals, or other releases of hazardous substances or materials. Environmental laws and regulations can be complex and may change often. Capital and operating expenses required to comply with environmental laws and regulations can be significant, and violations may result in substantial fines and penalties. In addition, environmental laws and regulations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, in the United States impose liability on several grounds for the investigation and cleanup of contaminated soil, ground water and buildings and for damages to natural resources on a wide range of properties. For example, contamination at properties formerly owned or operated by the Company, as well as at properties it will own and operate, and properties to which hazardous substances were sent by the Company, may result in liability for the Company under environmental laws and regulations. The costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance, or liability with respect to contamination in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.9 We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to pay dividends or purchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program.We continue to pay and declare dividends on a quarterly basis and we anticipate that we will continue to do so. However, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash or surplus under the law to be able to continue to pay dividends at our current level or purchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. At December 31, 2019, a total of 217,999 may be purchased in the future under the repurchase programs which the Company announced in 2010 and 2019. This may result from extraordinary cash expenses, actual expenses exceeding contemplated costs, funding of capital expenditures, increases in reserves or lack of available capital. We may also suspend the payment of dividends or our stock repurchase program if the Board deems such action to be in the best interests of our shareholders. If we do not pay dividends or decrease the amount of dividends we pay, the price of our common stock would likely decrease.Our shares of common stock are thinly traded and our stock price may be volatile.Because our common stock is thinly traded, its market price may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market in general or the stock prices of other companies listed on major stock exchanges. There were approximately 2,936,360 shares of our common stock held by non-affiliates as of December 31, 2019. Thus, our common stock is less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and, as a result, the trading price for shares of our common stock may be more volatile. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price for our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger"
3,ACU,ACME UNITED CORP,2019-03-15,"Risk Factors
 The Company is subject to a number of significantoperational risks that might cause the Company’s actual results to vary materially from its forecasts, targets or projections,including: ·achieving planned revenue and profit growth in each of the Company'sbusiness segments; ·changes in customer requirements and in the volume of sales to principalcustomers; ·the ability of the Company to anticipate timing of orders and shipmentsparticularly in the ecommerce area; ·emergence of new competitors or consolidation of existing competitors;and ·industry demand fluctuations. The Company’s expectations for bothshort and long-term future net revenues are based on the Company’s estimates of future demand. Orders from the Company’sprincipal customers are ultimately based on demand from end-users and end-user demand can be difficult to predict. Low end-userdemand would negatively affect orders the Company receives from distributors and other principal customers which could, in turnadversely affect the Company’s revenues in any fiscal period. If the Company’s estimates of sales are not accurateand the Company experiences unforeseen variability in its revenues and operating results, the Company may be unable to adjustits expense levels accordingly and its profit margins could be adversely affected. Because our products are primarilysold by third parties, our financial results depend in part on the financial health of these parties and any loss of a third partydistributor could adversely affect the Company’s revenues.A large majority of the Company’s productsare sold through third-party distributors and large retailers. Some of our distributors also market products that compete withour products. Changes in the financial or business conditions or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customerscould affect our sales and profitability. Additionally, no assurances can be given thatany or all of such distributors or retailers will continue their relationships with the Company. Distributors and other significantretail customers cannot easily be replaced and the loss of revenues and the Company’s inability to reduce expenses to compensatefor the loss of revenues could adversely affect the Company’s net revenues and profit margins.  7  The ability to deliver products to our customers in a timelymanner and to satisfy our customers’ fulfillment standards are subject to several factors, some of which are beyond our control.Customers place great emphasis on timely deliveryof our products for specific selling seasons, especially during our second and third fiscal quarters, and on the fulfillment ofconsumer demand throughout the year. We cannot control all of the various factors that might affect product delivery to customers.Vendor production delays, cybersecurity attacks on our vendors, difficulties encountered in shipping from overseas and customsclearance delays are on-going risks of our business. We also rely upon third-party carriers for our product shipments from ourdistribution centers to customers. Accordingly, we are subject to risks, including labor disputes, inclement weather, natural disasters,cybersecurity attacks, possible acts of terrorism, availability of shipping containers, and increased security restrictions associatedwith such carriers’ ability to provide delivery services to meet our shipping needs.  Failure to deliver products toour customers in a timely and effective manner, often under special vendor requirements to use specific carriers and delivery schedules,could damage our reputation and brands and result in loss of customers or reduced orders. Reliance on foreign suppliers could adverselyaffect the Company’s business. The Company sources its products from supplierslocated in Asia, Europe and the United States. The Company’s Asia vendors are located primarily in China, which subjectsthe Company to various risks within the region including regulatory, political, economic and foreign currency changes. The Company’sability to select and retain reliable vendors and suppliers who provide timely deliveries of quality products efficiently willimpact its success in meeting customer demand for timely delivery of quality products. The Company’s sourcing operationsand its vendors are impacted by labor costs in China. Labor historically has been readily available at low cost relative to laborcosts in North America. However, as China is experiencing rapid social, political and economic changes, labor costs have risenin some regions and there can be no assurance that labor will continue to be available to the Company in China at costs consistentwith historical levels or that changes in labor or other laws will not be enacted which would have a material adverse effect onthe Company’s operations in China. Interruption of supplies from any of the Company’s vendors, or the loss of one ormore key vendors, could have a negative effect on the Company’s business and operating results.Changes in currency exchange ratesmight negatively affect the profitability and business prospects of the Company and its overseas vendors. In particular, the ChineseRenminbi has recently fluctuated against the U.S. Dollar, if the Chinese Renminbi continues to fluctuate with respect to the U.S.Dollar in the future, the Company may experience cost increases on such purchases, and this can adversely impact profitability.Future interventions by China may result in further currency appreciation and increase our product costs over time.  The Companymay not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related effects of the productcost increases. Additional factors that could adversely affectthe Company’s business include increases in transportation costs, new or increased import duties, transportation delays,work stoppages, capacity constraints and poor quality. The Company’s operations are increasinglyglobal in nature. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political andeconomic conditions in the countries in which we conduct business, by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and other factorsrelated to our international operations.As our international operations and activitiesexpand, we face increasing exposure to the risks of operating in foreign countries. These factors include:  · Changes generally in political, regulatory or economic conditions in the countries in which we conduct business.  · Trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products, including government subsidies, tax benefits, changes in local tax rates, trade actions (such as anti-dumping proceedings) and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over the Company.  · Changes in foreign currency exchange rates        which could adversely affect our competitive position, selling prices and manufacturing costs, and therefore the demand for our        products in a particular market.  8  These risks could affect the cost of manufacturingand selling our products, our pricing, sales volume, and ultimately our financial performance. The likelihood of such occurrencesand their potential effect on the Company vary from country to country and are unpredictable. Continuing uncertainty in the global economycould negatively impact our business. Uncertainty in the global economy could adverselyaffect our customers and our suppliers and businesses such as ours. In addition, any uncertainty could have a variety of negativeeffects on the Company, such as reduction in revenues, increased costs, lower gross margin percentages, increased allowances fordoubtful accounts and/or write-offs of accounts receivable and could otherwise have material adverse effects on our business, resultsof operations, financial condition and cash flows. Changes in trade policies, including the imposition of tariffsand their enforcement, may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and outlook.On September 24, 2018, the United States levied a third round oftariffs on the import of some products from China, which is an important source of many of the Company’s products. The firsttwo rounds targeted $50 billion of Chinese goods and applied a 25% tariff; these rounds had no impact on the Company.The third round targeted an additional $200 billion of Chinese goods and applied a 10% tariff that was scheduled to increaseto 25% at the start of 2019 but has been delayed. This latest round affects approximately 10% of the Company’s product purchasesand will increase our costs of procurement. These tariffs affect certain measuring products, folding knives and first aid components.In response to these tariffs, the Company has implemented a price increase on the affected products in order to offset their impact.Tariff levels may be further increased and the types of products subject to tariffs may be expanded. Although the Company intendsto pass additional price increases on to our customers, such tariff-related developments could have a negative impact on customerdemand and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we might have to modify ourcurrent business practices, including potentially sourcing from alternative vendors. The Company’s business is subjectto risks associated with seasonality which could adversely affect its cash flow, financial condition, or results of operations.The Company’s business, historically,has experienced higher sales volume in the second and third quarters of the calendar year, when compared to the first and fourthquarters. The Company is a major supplier of products related to the “back-to-school” season, which occurs principallyduring the months of May, June, July and August. If this typical seasonal increase in sales of certain portions of the Company’sproduct line does not materialize in any year, the Company could experience a material adverse effect on its business, financialcondition and results of operations. Failure to manage growth and continue toexpand our operations successfully could adversely affect our financial results.Our business has experienced significant historicalgrowth over the years, and we expect our business to continue to grow organically and through strategic acquisitions. This growthplaces significant demands on management and operational systems. If we cannot effectively manage our growth, it is likely to resultin operational inefficiencies and ineffective management of our business thus negatively impacting our operating results. To theextent we grow through strategic acquisitions, our success will depend on selecting the appropriate targets, integrating such acquisitionsquickly and effectively and realizing any expected synergies and cost savings related to such acquisitions. Loss of a major customer could result ina decrease in the Company’s future sales and earnings.Sales of our products are primarily concentratedin a few major customers including office product superstores and mass market distributors. The Company had one customer in 2018and two customers in 2017 that individually exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales. In 2018, net sales to this one customer wereapproximately 13%, of consolidated net sales. In 2017, net sales to the two customers were approximately 16% and 11%, respectively.The Company anticipates that a limited number of customers may account for a substantial portion of its total net revenues forthe foreseeable future. The business risks associated with this concentration, including increased credit risks for these and othercustomers and the possibility of related bad debt write-offs, could negatively affect our margins and profits. Additionally, theloss of a major customer, whether through competition or consolidation, or a disruption in sales to such a customer, could resultin a decrease of the Company’s future sales and earnings.  9  The loss of key management could adverselyaffect the Company’s ability to run its business. The Company’s success depends, to a largeextent, on the continued service of its executive management team, operating officers and other key personnel. The Company musttherefore continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and operating personnel sufficient to maintain its current businessand support its projected growth. The Company’s inability to meet its staffing requirements in the future could adverselyaffect its results of operations. Execution or the lack thereof, of our e-commerce businessmay reduce our operating results.Our e-commerce business constituted approximately10% of our net sales in 2018 and has been our fastest growing distribution channel over the last several years. The continuedsuccessful growth of our e-commerce business depends, in part, on third parties and factors over which we have limitedcontrol, including difficulty forecasting demand, changing consumer preferences, and e-commerce buying trends, both domesticallyand abroad, as well as promotional or other advertising initiatives employed by our customers or other third parties on their e-commerce sites. Additionally, sales in our e-commerce distribution channel may also divert sales from our other customers. Additionally, the success of our e-commerce businessdepends, in part, on the timely receipt of our products by our customers and their end users. The efficient flow of our productsrequires that our distribution facilities have adequate capacity to support increases in our e-commerce business. If we encounterdifficulties with forecasting and supply to our distribution facilities, we could face shortages of inventory, resulting in “outof stock” conditions in the e-commerce sites operated by our customers or other third parties, and we could incursignificantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers.  Our failure to successfully respond tothese risks and uncertainties might adversely affect the sales in our e-commerce business, as well as damage our brands. Failure to protect the Company’s proprietaryrights or the costs of protecting these rights could adversely affect its business. The Company’s success depends in parton its ability to obtain patents and trademarks and to preserve other intellectual property rights covering its products and processes.The Company has obtained certain domestic and foreign patents and intends to continue to seek patents on its inventions when appropriate.The process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that pending patents relatedto any of the Company’s products will be issued, in which case the Company may not be able to legally prevent others fromproducing similar and/or compatible competing products. If other companies were to sell similar and/or compatible competing products,the Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the Company’sefforts to protect its intellectual property will be successful. Any infringement of the Company’s intellectual propertyor legal defense of such action could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company is subject to intense competitionin all of the markets in which it competes. The Company’s products are sold in highlycompetitive markets including at mass merchants, high volume office supply stores and online. The Company believes that the principalpoints of competition in these markets are product innovation, quality, price, merchandising, design and engineering capabilities,product development, timeliness and completeness of delivery, conformity to customer specifications and post-sale support. Competitiveconditions may require the Company to match or better competitors’ prices to retain business or market shares. The Companybelieves that its competitive position will depend on continued investment in innovation and product development, manufacturingand sourcing, quality standards, marketing and customer service and support. The Company’s success will depend in part onits ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the variousmarket categories in which it competes. The Company may not have sufficient resources to make the investments that may be necessaryto anticipate those changing needs and the Company may not anticipate, identify, develop and market products successfully or otherwisebe successful in maintaining its competitive position. In addition, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in successfully developingand commercializing innovative new products on a continuing basis, and new product launches may not provide expected growth results.There are no significant barriers to entry into the markets for most of the Company’s products.  10  Compromises of our information systems orunauthorized access to confidential information or our customers' or associates' personal information may materially harm our businessor damage our reputation.Through our sales and marketing activitiesand our business operations, we collect and store confidential information and certain personal information from our customersand associates. We also process payment card information and check information. In addition, in the normal course of business,we gather and retain personal information about our associates and generate and have access to confidential business information.Although we have taken steps designed to safeguard such information, there can be no assurance that such information will be protectedagainst unauthorized access or disclosure. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our or our vendors' network security and,if successful, misappropriate such information. An Acme United associate, contractor or other third-party with whom we do businessmay also attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involvingsuch information. We could be subject to liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws, for failingto protect personal information, or for misusing personal information, such as use of such information for an unauthorized marketingpurpose. Any compromise of our systems or data could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and expose us to claims fromcustomers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, employees and other persons, any of which could havean adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company may not be able to maintainor to raise prices in response to inflation and increasing costs.Future market and competitive pressures mayprohibit the Company from raising prices to offset increased product costs, freight costs and other inflationary items or to offsetcurrency fluctuations. The inability to pass these costs through to the Company’s customers could have a negative effecton its results of operations. The Company may need to raise additionalcapital to fund its operations. The Company’s management believes that,under current conditions, the Company’s current cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by operations, together with theborrowing availability under its revolving loan agreement with HSBC Bank N.A., will be sufficient to fund planned operations forthe next twelve months. However, if the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, it may be required to findadditional funding sources. If adequate financing is unavailable or is unavailable on acceptable terms, the Company may be unableto maintain, develop or enhance its operations, products and services, take advantage of future opportunities or adequately respondto competitive pressures. Changesin interest rates could adversely affect us.Wehave exposure to increases in interest rates under our revolving credit loan agreement with HSBC, N.A. which presentlybears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.75%.  Inresponse to the last global economic recession, actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banking institutions, weretaken to create and maintain a low interest rate environment. However, in 2018, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interestrate three times. Increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs on our variable-rate debt as well as any futurefixed rate debt, we may incur at higher interest rates, and interest which we pay reduces our cash available for working capital,acquisitions, and other uses. Product liability claims or regulatory actionscould adversely affect the Company's financial results and reputation.Claims for losses or injuries allegedly causedby some of the Company’s products arise in the ordinary course of its business. In addition to the risk of substantial monetaryjudgments, product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the Company’sreputation in the marketplace or the value of its brands. The Company also could be required to recall possible defective products,which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although the Company maintains product liability insurance coverage,potential product liability claims are subject to a deductible or could be excluded under the terms of the policy.  11  The Company is subject to environmentalregulation and environmental risks. The Company is subject to national, state,provincial and/or local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations and prohibitions on the discharge and emissionof, and establish standards for the use, disposal and management of, certain materials and waste. These environmental laws andregulations also impose liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up sites, and certain damages resulting from presentand past spills, disposals, or other releases of hazardous substances or materials. Environmental laws and regulations can be complexand may change often. Capital and operating expenses required to comply with environmental laws and regulations can be significant,and violations may result in substantial fines and penalties. In addition, environmental laws and regulations, such as the ComprehensiveEnvironmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, in the United States impose liability on several grounds forthe investigation and cleanup of contaminated soil, ground water and buildings and for damages to natural resources on a wide rangeof properties. For example, contamination at properties formerly owned or operated by the Company, as well as at properties itwill own and operate, and properties to which hazardous substances were sent by the Company, may result in liability for the Companyunder environmental laws and regulations. The costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerningnoncompliance, or liability with respect to contamination in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Company’sfinancial condition or results of operations. We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to paydividends or purchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program.We continue to pay and declare dividendson a quarterly basis and we anticipate that we will continue to do so. However, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficientcash or surplus under the law to be able to continue to pay dividends at our current level or purchase shares of our common stockunder our stock repurchase program. (At December 31, 2018, a total of 17,999 may be purchased in the future under the repurchaseprogram which the Company announced in 2010.) This may result from extraordinary cash expenses, actual expenses exceeding contemplatedcosts, funding of capital expenditures, increases in reserves or lack of available capital. We may also suspend the payment ofdividends or our stock repurchase program if the Board deems such action to be in the best interests of our shareholders. If wedo not pay dividends or decrease the amount of dividends we pay, the price of our common stock would likely decrease. Our shares of common stock are thinly tradedand our stock price may be volatile.Because our common stock is thinlytraded, its market price may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market in general or the stock prices of othercompanies listed on major stock exchanges. There were approximately 2,910,112 shares of our common stock held bynon-affiliates as of December 31, 2018. Thus, our common stock is   less liquid than the stock of companies with broaderpublic ownership, and, as a result, the trading price for shares of our common stock may be more volatile. Among otherthings, trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price for our stockthan would be the case if our public float were larger. "
6,ACU,ACME UNITED CORP,2018-03-15,"Risk Factors
 The Company is subject to a number of significantoperational risks that might cause the Company’s actual results to vary materially from its forecasts, targets or projections,including: ·achieving planned revenue and profit growth in each of the Company'sbusiness segments; ·changes in customer requirements and in the volume of sales to principalcustomers; ·the timing of orders and shipments;  7  ·emergence of new competitors or consolidation of existing competitors;and ·industry demand fluctuations. The Company’s expectations for both shortand long-term future net revenues are based on the Company’s estimates of future demand. Orders from the Company’sprincipal customers are ultimately based on demand from end-users and end-user demand can be difficult to predict. Low end-userdemand would negatively affect orders the Company receives from distributors and other principal customers which could, in turnadversely affect the Company’s revenues in any fiscal period. If the Company’s estimates of sales are not accurateand the Company experiences unforeseen variability in its revenues and operating results, the Company may be unable to adjust itsexpense levels accordingly and its profit margins could be adversely affected. Uncertainties in the interpretation and application ofthe 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate.  The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TaxAct) was enacted on December 22, 2017, and significantly affected U.S. tax law by changing how the U.S. imposes income tax on multinationalcorporations. The U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantlyimpact how we will apply the law and impact our results of operations in the period issued. The Tax Act requires complex computationsnot previously provided in U.S. tax law. As such, the application of accounting guidance for such items is currently uncertain.Further, compliance with the Tax Act and the accounting for such provisions require accumulation of information not previouslyrequired or regularly produced. As a result, we have provided a provisional estimate on the effect of the Tax Act in our financialstatements. As additional regulatory guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authorities, as accounting treatment is clarified,as we perform additional analysis on the application of the law, and as we refine estimates in calculating the effect, our finalanalysis, which will be recorded in the period completed, may be different from our current provisional amounts, which could materiallyaffect our tax obligations and effective tax rate.Because our products are primarilysold by third parties, our financial results depend in part on the financial health of these parties and any loss of a third partydistributor could adversely affect the Company’s revenues.A large majority of the Company’s productsare sold through third-party distributors and large retailers. Some of our distributors also market products that compete withour products. Changes in the financial or business conditions or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customerscould affect our sales and profitability. Additionally, no assurances can be given thatany or all of such distributors or retailers will continue their relationships with the Company. Distributors and other significantretail customers cannot easily be replaced and the loss of revenues and the Company’s inability to reduce expenses to compensatefor the loss of revenues could adversely affect the Company’s net revenues and profit margins. The ability to deliver products to our customers in a timelymanner and to satisfy our customers’ fulfillment standards are subject to several factors, some of which are beyond our control.Customers place great emphasis on timely deliveryof our products for specific selling seasons, especially during our second and third fiscal quarters, and on the fulfillment ofconsumer demand throughout the year. We cannot control all of the various factors that might affect product delivery to customers.Vendor production delays, cybersecurity attacks on our vendors, difficulties encountered in shipping from overseas and customsclearance delays are on-going risks of our business. We also rely upon third-party carriers for our product shipments from ourdistribution centers to customers. Accordingly, we are subject to risks, including labor disputes, inclement weather, natural disasters,cybersecurity attacks, possible acts of terrorism, availability of shipping containers, and increased security restrictions associatedwith such carriers’ ability to provide delivery services to meet our shipping needs.  Failure to deliver products toour customers in a timely and effective manner, often under special vendor requirements to use specific carriers and delivery schedules,could damage our reputation and brands and result in loss of customers or reduced orders.  8  Reliance on foreign suppliers could adverselyaffect the Company’s business. The Company sources its products from supplierslocated in Asia, Europe and the United States. The Company’s Asia vendors are located primarily in China, which subjectsthe Company to various risks within the region including regulatory, political, economic and foreign currency changes. The Company’sability to select and retain reliable vendors and suppliers who provide timely deliveries of quality products efficiently willimpact its success in meeting customer demand for timely delivery of quality products. The Company’s sourcing operationsand its vendors are impacted by labor costs in China. Labor historically has been readily available at low cost relative to laborcosts in North America. However, as China is experiencing rapid social, political and economic changes, labor costs have risenin some regions and there can be no assurance that labor will continue to be available to the Company in China at costs consistentwith historical levels or that changes in labor or other laws will not be enacted which would have a material adverse effect onthe Company’s operations in China. Interruption of supplies from any of the Company’s vendors, or the loss of one ormore key vendors, could have a negative effect on the Company’s business and operating results. Changes in currency exchange rates mightnegatively affect the profitability and business prospects of the Company and its overseas vendors. In particular, although theChinese Renminbi has recently depreciated against the U.S. Dollar, if the Chinese Renminbi appreciates with respect to the U.S.Dollar in the future, the Company may experience cost increases on such purchases, and this can adversely impact profitability.Future interventions by China may result in further currency appreciation and increase our product costs over time.  TheCompany may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related effects ofthe product cost increases. Additional factors that could adversely affectthe Company’s business include increases in transportation costs, new or increased import duties, transportation delays,work stoppages, capacity constraints and poor quality. The Company’s operations are increasinglyglobal in nature. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political andeconomic conditions in the countries in which we conduct business, by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and other factorsrelated to our international operations.As our international operations and activitiesexpand, we face increasing exposure to the risks of operating in foreign countries. These factors include:  · Changes generally in political, regulatory or economic conditions in the countries in which we conduct business.  · Trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products, including government subsidies, tax benefits,  changes in local tax rates, trade actions (such as anti-dumping proceedings) and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over the Company.  · Changes in foreign currency exchange rates        which could adversely affect our competitive position, selling prices and manufacturing costs, and therefore the demand for our        products in a particular market. These risks could affect the cost of manufacturingand selling our products, our pricing, sales volume, and ultimately our financial performance. The likelihood of such occurrencesand their potential effect on the Company vary from country to country and are unpredictable. Continuing uncertainty in the global economycould negatively impact our business. Uncertainty in the global economy could adverselyaffect our customers and our suppliers and businesses such as ours. In addition, any uncertainty could have a variety of negativeeffects on the Company, such as reduction in revenues, increased costs, lower gross margin percentages, increased allowances fordoubtful accounts and/or write-offs of accounts receivable and could otherwise have material adverse effects on our business, resultsof operations, financial condition and cash flows.  9  The Company’s business is subjectto risks associated with seasonality which could adversely affect its cash flow, financial condition, or results of operations.The Company’s business, historically,has experienced higher sales volume in the second and third quarters of the calendar year, when compared to the first and fourthquarters. The Company is a major supplier of products related to the “back-to-school” season, which occurs principallyduring the months of May, June, July and August. If this typical seasonal increase in sales of certain portions of the Company’sproduct line does not materialize in any year, the Company could experience a material adverse effect on its business, financialcondition and results of operations. Failure to manage growth and continue toexpand our operations successfully could adversely affect our financial results.Our business has experienced significant historicalgrowth over the years, and we expect our business to continue to grow organically and through strategic acquisitions. This growthplaces significant demands on management and operational systems. If we cannot effectively manage our growth, it is likely to resultin operational inefficiencies and ineffective management of our business thus negatively impacting our operating results. To theextent we grow through strategic acquisitions, our success will depend on selecting the appropriate targets, integrating such acquisitionsquickly and effectively and realizing any expected synergies and cost savings related to such acquisitions. Loss of a major customer could result ina decrease in the Company’s future sales and earnings.Sales of our products are primarily concentratedin a few major customers including office product superstores and mass market distributors. In each 2017 and 2016, the Companyhad two customers that individually exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales. In 2017, net sales to these customers amounted to approximately16% and 11%, respectively, of consolidated net sales, and approximately 14% and 11%, respectively, of consolidated net sales foreach in 2016. The Company anticipates that a limited number of customers may account for a substantial portion of its total netrevenues for the foreseeable future. The business risks associated with this concentration, including increased credit risks forthese and other customers and the possibility of related bad debt write-offs, could negatively affect our margins and profits.Additionally, the loss of a major customer, whether through competition or consolidation, or a disruption in sales to such a customer,could result in a decrease of the Company’s future sales and earnings. The loss of key management could adverselyaffect the Company’s ability to run its business. The Company’s success depends, to a largeextent, on the continued service of its executive management team, operating officers and other key personnel. The Company musttherefore continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and operating personnel sufficient to maintain its current businessand support its projected growth. The Company’s inability to meet its staffing requirements in the future could adverselyaffect its results of operations. Execution or the lack thereof, of our e-commerce businessmay reduce our operating results.Our e-commerce business constituted approximately 13% of our netsales in 2017 and has been our fastest growing distribution channel over the last several years. The continued successfulgrowth of our e-commerce business depends, in part, on third parties and factors over which we have limited control,including difficulty forecasting demand, changing consumer preferences, and e-commerce buying trends, both domestically and abroad,as well as promotional or other advertising initiatives employed by our customers or other third parties on their e-commerce sites. Additionally, sales in our e-commerce distribution channel may also divert sales from our other customers. Additionally, the success of our e-commerce business depends,in part, on the timely receipt of our products by our customers and their end users. The efficient flow of our products requiresthat our distribution facilities have adequate capacity to support increases in our e-commerce business. If we encounter difficultieswith forecasting and supply to our distribution facilities, we could face shortages of inventory, resulting in “out of stock”conditions in the e-commerce sites operated by our customers or other third parties, and we could incur significantlyhigher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers.  Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertaintiesmight adversely affect the sales in our e-commerce business, as well as damage our brands.  10  Failure to protect the Company’s proprietaryrights or the costs of protecting these rights could adversely affect its business. The Company’s success depends in parton its ability to obtain patents and trademarks and to preserve other intellectual property rights covering its products and processes.The Company has obtained certain domestic and foreign patents, and intends to continue to seek patents on its inventions when appropriate.The process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that pending patents relatedto any of the Company’s products will be issued, in which case the Company may not be able to legally prevent others fromproducing similar and/or compatible competing products. If other companies were to sell similar and/or compatible competing products,the Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the Company’sefforts to protect its intellectual property will be successful. Any infringement of the Company’s intellectual propertyor legal defense of such action could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company is subject to intense competitionin all of the markets in which it competes. The Company’s products are sold in highlycompetitive markets including at mass merchants, high volume office supply stores and online. The Company believes that the principalpoints of competition in these markets are product innovation, quality, price, merchandising, design and engineering capabilities,product development, timeliness and completeness of delivery, conformity to customer specifications and post-sale support. Competitiveconditions may require the Company to match or better competitors’ prices to retain business or market shares. The Companybelieves that its competitive position will depend on continued investment in innovation and product development, manufacturingand sourcing, quality standards, marketing and customer service and support. The Company’s success will depend in part onits ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the variousmarket categories in which it competes. The Company may not have sufficient resources to make the investments that may be necessaryto anticipate those changing needs and the Company may not anticipate, identify, develop and market products successfully or otherwisebe successful in maintaining its competitive position. In addition there are numerous uncertainties inherent in successfully developingand commercializing innovative new products on a continuing basis, and new product launches may not provide expected growth results.There are no significant barriers to entry into the markets for most of the Company’s products. Compromises of our information systems orunauthorized access to confidential information or our customers' or associates' personal information may materially harm our businessor damage our reputation.Through our sales and marketing activities and our business operations,we collect and store confidential information and certain personal information from our customers and associates. We also processpayment card information and check information. In addition, in the normal course of business, we gather and retain personal informationabout our associates and generate and have access to confidential business information. Although we have taken steps designed tosafeguard such information, there can be no assurance that such information will be protected against unauthorized access or disclosure.Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our or our vendors' network security and, if successful, misappropriate such information.An Acme United associate, contractor or other third-party with whom we do business may also attempt to circumvent our securitymeasures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. We could be subject toliability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws, for failing to protect personal information, or formisusing personal information, such as use of such information for an unauthorized marketing purpose. Any compromise of our systemsor data could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and expose us to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulators,payment card associations, employees and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial conditionand results of operations. The Company may not be able to maintainor to raise prices in response to inflation and increasing costs.Future market and competitive pressures mayprohibit the Company from raising prices to offset increased product costs, freight costs and other inflationary items or to offsetcurrency fluctuations. The inability to pass these costs through to the Company’s customers could have a negative effecton its results of operations.  11  The Company may need to raise additionalcapital to fund its operations. The Company’s management believes that,under current conditions, the Company’s current cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by operations, together with theborrowing availability under its revolving loan agreement with HSBC Bank N.A., will be sufficient to fund planned operations forthe next twelve months. However, if the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, it may be required to findadditional funding sources. If adequate financing is unavailable or is unavailable on acceptable terms, the Company may be unableto maintain, develop or enhance its operations, products and services, take advantage of future opportunities or adequately respondto competitive pressures. Changesin interest rates could adversely affect us.Wehave exposure to increases in interest rates under our revolving credit loan agreement with HSBC, N.A. which presentlybears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2%.  Inresponse to the last global economic recession, actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banking institutions, weretaken to create and maintain a low interest rate environment. However, in 2017, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interestrate three times and indicated that additional increases would likely be forthcoming in 2018. While it is unclear whether theseactions suggest a change in previous monetary policy positions, any such change or market expectation of such change may resultin significantly higher long-term interest rates. Increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs on our variable-ratedebt as well as any future fixed rate debt, we may incur at higher interest rates, and interest which we pay reduces our cash availablefor working capital, acquisitions, and other uses. Product liability claims or regulatory actionscould adversely affect the Company's financial results and reputation.Claims for losses or injuries allegedly causedby some of the Company’s products arise in the ordinary course of its business. In addition to the risk of substantial monetaryjudgments, product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the Company’sreputation in the marketplace or the value of its brands. The Company also could be required to recall possible defective products,which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although the Company maintains product liability insurance coverage,potential product liability claims are subject to a deductible or could be excluded under the terms of the policy. The Company is subject to environmentalregulation and environmental risks. The Company is subject to national, state,provincial and/or local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations and prohibitions on the discharge and emissionof, and establish standards for the use, disposal and management of, certain materials and waste. These environmental laws andregulations also impose liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up sites, and certain damages resulting from presentand past spills, disposals, or other releases of hazardous substances or materials. Environmental laws and regulations can be complexand may change often. Capital and operating expenses required to comply with environmental laws and regulations can be significant,and violations may result in substantial fines and penalties. In addition, environmental laws and regulations, such as the ComprehensiveEnvironmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, in the United States impose liability on several grounds forthe investigation and cleanup of contaminated soil, ground water and buildings and for damages to natural resources on a wide rangeof properties. For example, contamination at properties formerly owned or operated by the Company, as well as at properties itwill own and operate, and properties to which hazardous substances were sent by the Company, may result in liability for the Companyunder environmental laws and regulations. The costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerningnoncompliance, or liability with respect to contamination in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Company’sfinancial condition or results of operations. We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to paydividends or purchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program.We continue to pay and declare dividends on a quarterly basisand we anticipate that we will continue to do so. However, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash or surplusunder the law to be able to continue to pay dividends or purchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program.(At December 31, 2017, a total of 41,227 may be purchased in the future under the repurchase program which the Company announcedin 2010.) This may result from extraordinary cash expenses, actual expenses exceeding contemplated costs, funding of capital expenditures,increases in reserves or lack of available capital. We may also suspend the payment of dividends or our stock repurchase programif the Board deems such action to be in the best interests of our shareholders. If we do not pay dividends, the price of our commonstock would likely decrease.  12  Our shares of common stock are thinly tradedand our stock price may be volatile.Because our common stock is thinly traded,its market price may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market in general or the stock prices of other companies listedon major stock exchanges. There were approximately 2,959,874 shares of our common stock held by non-affiliates as of December 31,2017. Thus, our common stock will be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and, as a result, thetrading price for shares of our common stock may be more volatile. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume ofour common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price for our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger. "

Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the Company’sefforts to protect its intellectual property will be successful. Any infringement of the Company’s intellectual propertyor legal defense of such action could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company is subject to intense competition in all of the marketsin which it competes. The Company’s products are sold in highly competitive marketsincluding at mass merchants, high volume office supply stores and online. The Company believes that the principal points of competitionin these markets are product innovation, quality, price, merchandising, design and engineering capabilities, product development,timeliness and completeness of delivery, conformity to customer specifications and post-sale support. Competitive conditions mayrequire the Company to match or better competitors’ prices to retain business or market shares. The Company believes thatits competitive position will depend on continued investment in innovation and product development, manufacturing and sourcing,quality standards, marketing and customer service and support. The Company’s success will depend in part on its ability toanticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various market categoriesin which it competes. The Company may not have sufficient resources to make the investments that may be necessary to anticipatethose changing needs and the Company may not anticipate, identify, develop and market products successfully or otherwise be successfulin maintaining its competitive position. In addition there are numerous uncertainties inherent in successfully developing and commercializinginnovative new products on a continuing basis, and new product launches may not provide expected growth results. There are no significantbarriers to entry into the markets for most of the Company’s products. Compromises of our information systems orunauthorized access to confidential information or our customers' or associates' personal information may materially harm our businessor damage our reputation.Through our sales and marketing activities and our business operations,we collect and store confidential information and certain personal information from our customers and associates. We also processpayment card information and check information. In addition, in the normal course of business, we gather and retain personal informationabout our associates and generate and have access to confidential business information. Although we have taken steps designed tosafeguard such information, there can be no assurance that such information will be protected against unauthorized access or disclosure.Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our or our vendors' network security and, if successful, misappropriate such information.An Acme United associate, contractor or other third-party with whom we do business may also attempt to circumvent our securitymeasures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. We could be subject toliability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws, for failing to protect personal information, or formisusing personal information, such as use of such information for an unauthorized marketing purpose. Loss or misuse of confidentialor personal information could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and expose us to claims from customers, financialinstitutions, regulators, payment card associations, employees and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect onour business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company may not be able to maintain or to raise prices inresponse to inflation and increasing costs.Future market and competitive pressures may prohibit the Companyfrom raising prices to offset increased product costs, freight costs and other inflationary items or to offset currency fluctuations.The inability to pass these costs through to the Company’s customers could have a negative effect on its results of operations.  10  The Company may need to raise additional capital to fund itsoperations. The Company’s management believes that, under current conditions,the Company’s current cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by operations, together with the borrowing availability underits revolving loan agreement with HSBC Bank N.A., will be sufficient to fund planned operations for the next twelve months. However,if the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, it may be required to find additional funding sources. Ifadequate financing is unavailable or is unavailable on acceptable terms, the Company may be unable to maintain, develop or enhanceits operations, products and services, take advantage of future opportunities or adequately respond to competitive pressures. Changes in interest ratescould adversely affect us.Wehave exposure to increases in interest rates under our revolving credit loan agreement with HSBC, N.A.which presently bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2%.   Inresponse to the last global economic recession,  actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banking institutions,were taken to create and maintain a low interest rate environment. However, in December 2015, the U.S. Federal Reserve raisedits benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point for the first time since 2006. The U.S. Federal Reserve raisedthis rate by an additional quarter of a percentage point in December 2016 and indicated that additional increases wouldlikely be forthcoming in 2017. While it is unclear whether these actions suggest a change in previous monetary policypositions, any such change or market expectation of such change may result in significantly higher long-term interest rates.  Increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs on our variable-rate debt, as well as any futurefixed rate debt we may incur at higher interest rates, and interest which we pay reduces our cash available for workingcapital, acquisitions, and other uses. Product liability claims or regulatory actions could adverselyaffect the Company's financial results and reputation.Claims for losses or injuries allegedly caused by some of the Company’sproducts arise in the ordinary course of its business. In addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments, product liabilityclaims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the Company’s reputation in the marketplaceor the value of its brands. The Company also could be required to recall possible defective products, which could result in adversepublicity and significant expenses. Although the Company maintains product liability insurance coverage, potential product liabilityclaims are subject to a deductible or could be excluded under the terms of the policy. The Company is subject to environmentalregulation and environmental risks. The Company is subject to national, state, provincial and/or localenvironmental laws and regulations that impose limitations and prohibitions on the discharge and emission of, and establish standardsfor the use, disposal and management of, certain materials and waste. These environmental laws and regulations also impose liabilityfor the costs of investigating and cleaning up sites, and certain damages resulting from present and past spills, disposals, orother releases of hazardous substances or materials. Environmental laws and regulations can be complex and may change often. Capitaland operating expenses required to comply with environmental laws and regulations can be significant, and violations may resultin substantial fines and penalties. In addition, environmental laws and regulations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response,Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, in the United States impose liability on several grounds for the investigation and cleanupof contaminated soil, ground water and buildings and for damages to natural resources on a wide range of properties. For example,contamination at properties formerly owned or operated by the Company, as well as at properties it will own and operate, and propertiesto which hazardous substances were sent by the Company, may result in liability for the Company under environmental laws and regulations.The costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance, or liability with respectto contamination in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.Refer to Note 16 – Sale of Property - of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the environmentalcosts related to the sale in 2014 of property owned by the Company in Fremont, NC.  11  The ability to deliver products to our customers in a timelymanner and to satisfy our customers’ fulfillment standards are subject to several factors, some of which are beyond our control.Customers place great emphasis on timely delivery of our productsfor specific selling seasons, especially during our second and third fiscal quarters, and on the fulfillment of consumer demandthroughout the year. We cannot control all of the various factors that might affect product delivery to customers. Vendor productiondelays, difficulties encountered in shipping from overseas and customs clearance delays are on-going risks of our business. Wealso rely upon third-party carriers for our product shipments from our distribution centers to customers. Accordingly, we are subjectto risks, including labor disputes, inclement weather, natural disasters, possible acts of terrorism, availability of shippingcontainers, and increased security restrictions associated with such carriers’ ability to provide delivery services to meetour shipping needs.  Failure to deliver products to our customers in a timely and effective manner, often under special vendorrequirements to use specific carriers and delivery schedules, could damage our reputation and brands and result in loss of customersor reduced orders. Our shares of common stock are thinly traded and our stock pricemay be volatile.Because our common stock is thinly traded, its market price mayfluctuate significantly more than the stock market in general or the stock prices of other companies listed on major stock exchanges.There were approximately 2,903,424 shares of our common stock held by non-affiliates as of December 31, 2016. Thus, our commonstock will be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and, as a result, the trading price for sharesof our common stock may be more volatile. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may havea greater impact on the trading price for our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger.  12  "
11,ACU,ACME UNITED CORP,2016-03-11,"Risk Factors
 The Company is subject to a number of significant operationalrisks that might cause the Company’s actual results to vary materially from its forecasts, targets or projections, including: ·achieving planned revenue and profit growth in each of the Company'sbusiness segments;  7  ·changes in customer requirements and in the volume of sales to principalcustomers; ·the timing of orders and shipments; ·emergence of new competitors or consolidation of existing competitors;and ·industry demand fluctuations. The Company’s expectations for both short and long-term futurenet revenues are based on the Company’s estimates of future demand. Orders from the Company’s principal customersare ultimately based on demand from end-users and end-user demand can be difficult to predict. Low end-user demand would negativelyaffect orders the Company receives from distributors and other principal customers which could, in turn adversely affect the Company’srevenues in any fiscal period. If the Company’s estimates of sales are not accurate and the Company experiences unforeseenvariability in its revenues and operating results, the Company may be unable to adjust its expense levels accordingly and itsprofit margins could be adversely affected.Because our products are primarilysold by third parties, our financial results depend in part on the financial health of these parties and any loss of a third partydistributor could adversely affect the Company’s revenues.A number of the Company’s products are sold through third-partydistributors and large retailers. Some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products. Changes in thefinancial or business conditions or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could affect our sales andprofitability. Additionally, no assurances can be given that any or all of suchdistributors or retailers will continue their relationships with the Company. Distributors and other significant retail customerscannot easily be replaced and the loss of revenues and the Company’s inability to reduce expenses to compensate for the lossof revenues could adversely affect the Company’s net revenues and profit margins. The ability to deliver products to our customers in a timelymanner and to satisfy our customers’ fulfillment standards are subject to several factors, some of which are beyond our control.Customers place great emphasis on timely delivery of our productsfor specific selling seasons, especially during our second and third fiscal quarters, and on the fulfillment of consumer demandthroughout the year. We cannot control all of the various factors that might affect product delivery to customers. Vendor productiondelays, difficulties encountered in shipping from overseas and customs clearance delays are on-going risks of our business. Wealso rely upon third-party carriers for our product shipments from our distribution centers to customers. Accordingly, we are subjectto risks, including labor disputes, inclement weather, natural disasters, possible acts of terrorism, availability of shippingcontainers, and increased security restrictions associated with such carriers’ ability to provide delivery services to meetour shipping needs.  Failure to deliver products to our customers in a timely and effective manner, often under special vendorrequirements to use specific carriers and delivery schedules, could damage our reputation and brands and result in loss of customersor reduced orders. Reliance on foreign suppliers could adversely affect the Company’sbusiness. The Company sources its products from suppliers located in Asia,Europe and the United States. The Company’s Asia vendors are located primarily in China, which subjects the Company to variousrisks within the region including regulatory, political, economic and foreign currency changes. The Company’s ability toselect and retain reliable vendors and suppliers who provide timely deliveries of quality products efficiently will impact itssuccess in meeting customer demand for timely delivery of quality products. The Company’s sourcing operations and its vendorsare impacted by labor costs in China. Labor historically has been readily available at low cost relative to labor costs in NorthAmerica. However, as China is experiencing rapid social, political and economic changes, labor costs have risen in some regionsand there can be no assurance that labor will continue to be available to the Company in China at costs consistent with historicallevels or that changes in labor or other laws will not be enacted which would have a material adverse effect on the Company’soperations in China. Interruption of supplies from any of the Company’s vendors, or the loss of one or more key vendors,could have a negative effect on the Company’s business and operating results.  8   Changes in currency exchange rates might negatively affectthe profitability and business prospects of the Company and its overseas vendors. In particular, although the Chinese Renminbihas recently depreciated against the U.S. Dollar, if the Chinese Renminbi appreciates with respect to the U.S. Dollar in the future,the Company may experience cost increases on such purchases, and this can adversely impact profitability. Future interventionsby China may result in further currency appreciation and increase our product costs over time.  The Company may not be successfulat implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related effects of the product cost increases. Additional factors that could adversely affect the Company’sbusiness include increases in transportation costs, new or increased import duties, transportation delays, work stoppages, capacityconstraints and poor quality. The Company’s operations are increasingly global in nature.Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditionsin the countries in which we conduct business, by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and other factors related to our internationaloperations.As our international operations and activities expand, we face increasingexposure to the risks of operating in foreign countries. These factors include: ·Changes generally in political, regulatory or economic conditions in the countries in which we conduct business. ·Trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products, including government subsidies, tax benefits,  changes in local tax rates, trade actions (such as anti-dumping proceedings) and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over the company. ·Changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could adversely        affect our competitive position, selling prices and manufacturing costs, and therefore the demand for our products in a particular        market.  These risks could affect the cost of manufacturing and selling ourproducts, our pricing, sales volume, and ultimately our financial performance. The likelihood of such occurrences and their potentialeffect on the Company vary from country to country and are unpredictable. Continuing uncertainty in the global economy could negativelyimpact our business. Uncertainty in the global economy could adversely affect our customersand our suppliers and businesses such as ours. In addition, any uncertainty could have a variety of negative effects on the Company,such as reduction in revenues, increased costs, lower gross margin percentages, increased allowances for doubtful accounts and/orwrite-offs of accounts receivable and could otherwise have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financialcondition and cash flows. The Company’s business is subject to risks associated withseasonality which could adversely affect its cash flow, financial condition, or results of operations.The Company’s business, historically, has experienced highersales volume in the second and third quarters of the calendar year, when compared to the first and fourth quarters. The Companyis a major supplier of products related to the “back-to-school” season, which occurs principally during the monthsof May, June, July and August. If this typical seasonal increase in sales of certain portions of the Company’s product linedoes not materialize in any year, the Company could experience a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition andresults of operations.  Failure to manage growth and continue toexpand our operations successfully could adversely affect our financial results.Our business has experienced significant historicalgrowth over the years, and we expect our business to continue to grow organically and through strategic acquisitions. This growthplaces significant demands on management and operational systems. If we cannot effectively manage our growth, it is likely to resultin operational inefficiencies and ineffective management of our business thus negatively impacting our operating results. To theextent we grow through strategic acquisitions, our success will depend on selecting the appropriate targets, integrating such acquisitionsquickly and effectively and realizing any expected synergies and cost savings related to such acquisitions.  9  Loss of a major customer could result in a decrease inthe Company’s future sales and earnings.Sales of our products are primarily concentrated in a few majorcustomers including office product superstores and mass market distributors. In 2015 and 2014, the Company had two customers, respectivelythat individually exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales. Net sales to these customers amounted to approximately 12% for each in2015 and 14% and 12% in 2014. The Company anticipates that a limited number of customers may account for a substantial portionof its total net revenues for the foreseeable future. The business risks associated with this concentration, including increasedcredit risks for these and other customers and the possibility of related bad debt write-offs, could negatively affect our marginsand profits. Additionally, the loss of a major customer, whether through competition or consolidation, or a disruption in salesto such a customer, could result in a decrease of the Company’s future sales and earnings.  The loss of key management could adversely affect the Company’sability to run its business. The Company’s success depends, to a large extent, on the continuedservice of its executive management team, operating officers and other key personnel. The Company must therefore continue to recruit,retain and motivate management and operating personnel sufficient to maintain its current business and support its projected growth.The Company’s inability to meet its staffing requirements in the future could adversely affect its results of operations. Failure to protect the Company’s proprietary rights orthe costs of protecting these rights could adversely affect its business. The Company’s success depends in part on its ability toobtain patents and  trademarks and to preserve other intellectual property rights covering its products and processes. TheCompany has obtained certain domestic and foreign patents, and intends to continue to seek patents on its inventions whenappropriate. The process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance thatpending patents related to any of the Company’s products will be issued, in which case the Company may not be able tolegally prevent others from producing similar and/or compatible competing products. If other companies were to sell similarand/or compatible competing products, the Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore,there can be no assurance that the Company’s efforts to protect its intellectual property will be successful. Anyinfringement of the Company’s intellectual property or legal defense of such action could have a material adverseeffect on the Company. The Company is subject to intense competition in all of the marketsin which it competes.

The Company anticipates that a limited number of customers may account for a substantialportion of its total net revenues for the foreseeable future. The business risks associated with this concentration, includingincreased credit risks for these and other customers and the possibility of related bad debt write-offs, could negatively affectour margins and profits. Additionally, the loss of a major customer, whether through competition or consolidation, or a disruptionin sales to such a customer, could result in a decrease of the Company’s future sales and earnings. The loss of key management could adversely affect the Company’sability to run its business. The Company’s success depends, to a large extent, onthe continued service of its executive management team, operating officers and other key personnel. The Company must thereforecontinue to recruit, retain and motivate management and operating personnel sufficient to maintain its current business and supportits projected growth. The Company’s inability to meet its staffing requirementsin the future could adversely affect its results of operations. 9 Failure to protect the Company’s proprietary rightsor the costs of protecting these rights could adversely affect its business. The Company’s success depends in part on its abilityto obtain patents and licenses and to preserve other intellectual property rights covering its products and processes. The Companyhas obtained certain domestic and foreign patents, and intends to continue to seek patents on its inventions when appropriate.The process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that pending patents relatedto any of the Company’s products will be issued, in which case the Company may not be able to legally prevent others fromproducing similar and/or compatible competing products. If other companies were to sell similar and/or compatible competing products,the Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the Company’sefforts to protect its intellectual property will be successful. Any infringement of the Company’s intellectual propertyor legal defense of such action could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company is subject to intense competition in all ofthe markets in which it competes. The Company’s products are sold in highly competitivemarkets including at mass merchants, high volume office supply stores and online. The Company believes that the principal pointsof competition in these markets are product innovation, quality, price, merchandising, design and engineering capabilities, productdevelopment, timeliness and completeness of delivery, conformity to customer specifications and post-sale support. Competitiveconditions may require the Company to match or better competitors’ prices to retain business or market shares. The Companybelieves that its competitive position will depend on continued investment in innovation and product development, manufacturingand sourcing, quality standards, marketing and customer service and support. The Company’s success will depend in part onits ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the variousmarket categories in which it competes. The Company may not have sufficient resources to make the investments that may be necessaryto anticipate those changing needs and the Company may not anticipate, identify, develop and market products successfully or otherwisebe successful in maintaining its competitive position. There are no significant barriers to entry into the markets for most ofthe Company’s products. To compete successfully, the Company must develop and commercializea continuing stream of innovative new products that create consumer demand.The Company’s long-term successin the current competitive environment depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative newproducts that create and maintain consumer demand. The Company also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovativenew products that compete with the Company’s products. The Company’s strategy includes increased investment in newproduct development and continued focus on innovation. There are, nevertheless, numerous uncertainties inherent in successfullydeveloping and commercializing innovative new products on a continuing basis, and new product launches may not provide expectedgrowth results. Compromises of our information systemsor unauthorized access to confidential information or our customers' or associates' personal information may materially harm ourbusiness or damage our reputation.Through our sales and marketing activitiesand our business operations, we collect and store confidential information and certain personal information from our customersand associates. We also process payment card information and check information. In addition, in the normal course of business,we gather and retain personal information about our associates and generate and have access to confidential business information.Although we have taken steps designed to safeguard such information, there can be no assurance that such information will be protectedagainst unauthorized access or disclosure. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our or our vendors' network security and,if successful, misappropriate such information. An Acme United associate, contractor or other third-party with whom we do businessmay also attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involvingsuch information. We could be subject to liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws, for failingto protect personal information, or for misusing personal information, such as use of such information for an unauthorized marketingpurpose. Loss or misuse of confidential or personal information could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and exposeus to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, employees and other persons, any ofwhich could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company may not be able to maintain or to raise pricesin response to inflation and increasing costs.Future market and competitive pressures may prohibit the Companyfrom raising prices to offset increased product costs, freight costs and other inflationary items. The inability to pass thesecosts through to the Company’s customers could have a negative effect on its results of operations. 10 The Company may need to raise additional capital to fundits operations. The Company’s management believes that, under currentconditions, the Company’s current cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by operations, together with the borrowing availabilityunder its revolving loan agreement with HSBC Bank N.A., will be sufficient to fund planned operations for the next twelve months.However, if the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, it may be required to find additional funding sources.If adequate financing is unavailable or is unavailable on acceptable terms, the Company may be unable to maintain, develop orenhance its operations, products and services, take advantage of future opportunities or adequately respond to competitive pressures. Product liability claims or regulatory actions could adverselyaffect the Company's financial results and reputation.Claims for losses or injuries allegedly caused by some of theCompany’s products arise in the ordinary course of its business. In addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments,product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the Company’s reputationin the marketplace or the value of its brands. The Company also could be required to recall possible defective products, whichcould result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although the Company maintains product liability insurance coverage,potential product liability claims are subject to a deductible or could be excluded under the terms of the policy.  The Company is subject to environmentalregulation and environmental risks. The Company is subject to national, state, provincial and/orlocal environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations and prohibitions on the discharge and emission of, and establishstandards for the use, disposal and management of, certain materials and waste. These environmental laws and regulations alsoimpose liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up sites, and certain damages resulting from present and past spills,disposals, or other releases of hazardous substances or materials. Environmental laws and regulations can be complex and may changeoften. Capital and operating expenses required to comply with environmental laws and regulations can be significant, and violationsmay result in substantial fines and penalties. In addition, environmental laws and regulations, such as the Comprehensive EnvironmentalResponse, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, in the United States impose liability on several grounds for the investigationand cleanup of contaminated soil, ground water and buildings and for damages to natural resources on a wide range of properties.For example, contamination at properties formerly owned or operated by the Company, as well as at properties it will own and operate,and properties to which hazardous substances were sent by the Company, may result in liability for the Company under environmentallaws and regulations. The costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance,or liability with respect to contamination in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financialcondition or results of operations. Refer to Note 16 – Sale of Property - of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statementsfor further discussion of the environmental costs related to the sale in 2008 of property by the Company it owned in Bridgeport,CT and the sale in 2014 of property owned by the Company in Fremont, NC. The ability to deliver products to our customers in a timelymanner and to satisfy our customers’ fulfillment standards are subject to several factors, some of which are beyond ourcontrol.Customers place great emphasis on timely delivery of our productsfor specific selling seasons, especially during our second and third fiscal quarters, and on the fulfillment of consumer demandthroughout the year. We cannot control all of the various factors that might affect product delivery to customers. Vendor productiondelays, difficulties encountered in shipping from overseas and customs clearance delays are on-going risks of our business. Wealso rely upon third-party carriers for our product shipments from our distribution centers to customers. Accordingly, we aresubject to risks, including labor disputes, inclement weather, natural disasters, possible acts of terrorism, availability ofshipping containers, and increased security restrictions associated with such carriers’ ability to provide delivery servicesto meet our shipping needs.  Failure to deliver products to our customers in a timely and effective manner, often under specialvendor requirements to use specific carriers and delivery schedules, could damage our reputation and brands and result in lossof customers or reduced orders.  11  Our shares of common stock are thinly traded and our stockprice may be volatile.Because our common stock is thinly traded, its market pricemay fluctuate significantly more than the stock market in general or the stock prices of other companies listed on major stockexchanges. There were approximately 2,860,662 shares of our common stock held by non-affiliates as of December 31, 2014. Thus,our common stock will be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and, as a result, the tradingprice for shares of our common stock may be more volatile. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our commonstock may have a greater impact on the trading price for our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger.  "

                                                                                                                          demand                                                                                                                                                                                                 fluctuations. The Company’s expectations for both short and long-termfuture net revenues are based on the Company’s estimates of future demand. Orders from the Company’s principal customersare ultimately based on demand from end-users and end-user demand can be difficult to predict. Low end-user demand would negativelyaffect orders the Company receives from distributors and other principal customers which could, in turn adversely affect the Company’srevenues in any fiscal period. If the Company’s estimates of sales are not accurate and the Company experiences unforeseenvariability in its revenues and operating results, the Company may be unable to adjust its expense levels accordingly and itsprofit margins could be adversely affected. Because our products are primarilysold by third parties, our financial results depend in part on the financial health of these parties and any loss of a third partydistributor could adversely affect the Company’s revenues.A number of the Company’s products are sold through third-partydistributors and large retailers. Some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products. Changes in thefinancial or business conditions or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could affect our salesand profitability. Additionally, no assurances can be given that any or all ofsuch distributors or retailers will continue their relationships with the Company. Distributors and other significant retail customerscannot easily be replaced and the loss of revenues and the Company’s inability to reduce expenses to compensate for theloss of revenues could adversely affect the Company’s net revenues and profit margins. The Company’s operations are increasingly global innature. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economicconditions in the countries in which we conduct business, by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and other factors relatedto our international operations.As our international operations and activities expand, we faceincreasing exposure to the risks of operating in foreign countries. These factors include:  • Changes generally in political, regulatory    or economic conditions in the countries in which we conduct business.  • Trade protection measures in favor of    local producers of competing products, including government subsidies, tax benefits,  changes in local tax rates,    trade actions (such as anti-dumping proceedings) and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over the    company.  • Changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could        adversely affect our competitive position, selling prices and manufacturing costs, and therefore the demand for our products        in a particular market. These risks could affect the cost of manufacturing and sellingour products, our pricing, sales volume, and ultimately our financial performance. The likelihood of such occurrences and theirpotential effect on the company vary from country to country and are unpredictable. 7 Continuing Uncertainty in the global economy could negativelyimpact our business. Uncertainty in the global economy could adversely affect ourcustomers and our suppliers and businesses such as ours. In addition, any uncertainty could have a variety of negative effectson the Company, such as reduction in revenues, increased costs, lower gross margin percentages, increased allowances for doubtfulaccounts and/or write-offs of accounts receivable and could otherwise have material adverse effects on our business, results ofoperations, financial condition and cash flows. The Company’s business is subject to risks associatedwith seasonality which could adversely affect its cash flow, financial condition, or results of operations.The Company’s business, historically, has experiencedhigher sales volume in the second and third quarters of the calendar year, when compared to the first and fourth quarters. TheCompany is a major supplier of products related to the “back-to-school” season, which occurs principally during themonths of May, June, July and August. If this typical seasonal increase in sales of certain portions of the Company’s productline does not materialize in any year, the Company could experience a material adverse effect on its business, financial conditionand results of operations. Reliance on foreign suppliers could adversely affect theCompany’s business. The Company purchases the majority of its products from foreignmanufacturing partners and, as a result, its business is exposed to risks due to:Increases in transportation costs;New or increased import duties;Transportation delays;Work stoppages;Capacity constraints;Poor quality; andInflation and exchange rate fluctuations that could increasethe cost of foreign manufactured goods. Failure to manage growth and continueto expand our operations successfully could adversely affect our financial results.Our business has experienced significanthistorical growth over the years, and we expect our business to continue to grow organically and through strategic acquisitions.This growth places significant demands on management and operational systems. If we cannot effectively manage our growth, it islikely to result in operational inefficiencies and ineffective management of our business thus negatively impacting our operatingresults. To the extent we grow through strategic acquisitions, our success will depend on selecting the appropriate targets, integratingsuch acquisitions quickly and effectively and realizing any expected synergies and cost savings related to such acquisitions. Loss of a major customer could result in a decrease in theCompany’s future sales and earnings.Sales of our products are primarily concentrated in a few majorcustomers including office product superstores and mass market distributors. In 2013 and 2012, respectively, the Company had twocustomers that individually exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales. Net sales to these customers amountedto approximately 16% and 15% in 2013 and 17% and 12% in 2012. The Company anticipates that a limited number of customersmay account for a substantial portion of its total net revenues for the foreseeable future. The business risks associated withthis concentration, including increased credit risks for these and other customers and the possibility of related bad debt write-offs,could negatively affect our margins and profits. Additionally, the loss of a major customer, whether through competition or consolidation,or a disruption in sales to such a customer, could result in a decrease of the Company’s future sales and earnings. The loss of key management could adversely affect the Company’sability to run its business. The Company’s success depends, to a large extent, onthe continued service of its executive management team, operating officers and other key personnel. The Company must thereforecontinue to recruit, retain and motivate management and operating personnel sufficient to maintain its current business and supportits projected growth. The Company’s inability to meet its staffing requirementsin the future could adversely affect its results of operations. 8 Failure to protect the Company’s proprietary rightsor the costs of protecting these rights could adversely affect its business. The Company’s success depends in part on its abilityto obtain patents and licenses and to preserve other intellectual property rights covering its products and processes. The Companyhas obtained certain domestic and foreign patents, and intends to continue to seek patents on its inventions when appropriate.The process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that pending patents relatedto any of the Company’s products will be issued, in which case the Company may not be able to legally prevent others fromproducing similar and/or compatible competing products. If other companies were to sell similar and/or compatible competing products,the Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the Company’sefforts to protect its intellectual property will be successful. Any infringement of the Company’s intellectual propertyor legal defense of such action could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company is subject to intense competition in all ofthe markets in which it competes. The Company’s products are sold in highly competitivemarkets including at mass merchants, high volume office supply stores and online. The Company believes that the principal pointsof competition in these markets are product innovation, quality, price, merchandising, design and engineering capabilities, productdevelopment, timeliness and completeness of delivery, conformity to customer specifications and post-sale support. Competitiveconditions may require the Company to match or better competitors’ prices to retain business or market shares. The Companybelieves that its competitive position will depend on continued investment in innovation and product development, manufacturingand sourcing, quality standards, marketing and customer service and support. The Company’s success will depend in part onits ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the variousmarket categories in which it competes. The Company may not have sufficient resources to make the investments that may be necessaryto anticipate those changing needs and the Company may not anticipate, identify, develop and market products successfully or otherwisebe successful in maintaining its competitive position. There are no significant barriers to entry into the markets for most ofthe Company’s products. To compete successfully, the Company must develop and commercializea continuing stream of innovative new products that create consumer demand.The Company’s long-term successin the current competitive environment depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative newproducts that create and maintain consumer demand. The Company also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovativenew products that compete with the Company’s products. The Company’s strategy includes increased investment in newproduct development and continued focus on innovation. There are, nevertheless, numerous uncertainties inherent in successfullydeveloping and commercializing innovative new products on a continuing basis, and new product launches may not provide expectedgrowth results. Compromises of our information systemsor unauthorized access to confidential information or our customers' or associates' personal information may materially harm ourbusiness or damage our reputation.Through our sales and marketing activitiesand our business operations, we collect and store confidential information and certain personal information from our customersand associates. We also process payment card information and check information. In addition, in the normal course of business,we gather and retain personal information about our associates and generate and have access to confidential business information.Although we have taken steps designed to safeguard such information, there can be no assurance that such information will be protectedagainst unauthorized access or disclosure. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our or our vendors' network security and,if successful, misappropriate such information. An Acme United associate, contractor or other third-party with whom we do businessmay also attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involvingsuch information. We could be subject to liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws, for failingto protect personal information, or for misusing personal information, such as use of such information for an unauthorized marketingpurpose. Loss or misuse of confidential or personal information could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and exposeus to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, employees and other persons, any ofwhich could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company may not be able to maintain or to raise pricesin response to inflation and increasing costs.Future market and competitive pressures may prohibit the Companyfrom raising prices to offset increased product costs, freight costs and other inflationary items. The inability to pass thesecosts through to the Company’s customers could have a negative effect on its results of operations. 9 The Company may need to raise additional capital to fundits operations. The Company’s management believes that, under currentconditions, the Company’s current cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by operations, together with the borrowing availabilityunder its revolving loan agreement with HSBC Bank N.A., will be sufficient to fund planned operations for the next twelve months.However, if the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, it may be required to find additional funding sources.If adequate financing is unavailable or is unavailable on acceptable terms, the Company may be unable to maintain, develop orenhance its operations, products and services, take advantage of future opportunities or adequately respond to competitive pressures. Product liability claims or regulatory actions could adverselyaffect the Company's financial results and reputation.Claims for losses or injuries allegedly caused by some of theCompany’s products arise in the ordinary course of its business. In addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments,product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the Company’s reputationin the marketplace or the value of its brands. The Company also could be required to recall possible defective products, whichcould result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although the Company maintains product liability insurance coverage,potential product liability claims are subject to a deductible or could be excluded under the terms of the policy. The Company is subject to environmentalregulation and environmental risks. The Company is subject to national, state, provincial and/orlocal environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations and prohibitions on the discharge and emission of, and establishstandards for the use, disposal and management of, certain materials and waste. These environmental laws and regulations alsoimpose liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up sites, and certain damages resulting from present and past spills,disposals, or other releases of hazardous substances or materials. Environmental laws and regulations can be complex and may changeoften. Capital and operating expenses required to comply with environmental laws and regulations can be significant, and violationsmay result in substantial fines and penalties. In addition, environmental laws and regulations, such as the Comprehensive EnvironmentalResponse, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, in the United States impose liability on several grounds for the investigationand cleanup of contaminated soil, ground water and buildings and for damages to natural resources on a wide range of properties.For example, contamination at properties formerly owned or operated by the Company, as well as at properties it will own and operate,and properties to which hazardous substances were sent by the Company, may result in liability for the Company under environmentallaws and regulations. The costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance,or liability with respect to contamination in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financialcondition or results of operations. Refer to Note 16 – Sale of Property - of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statementsfor further discussion of the environmental costs related to the sale in 2008of property by the Company it owned in Bridgeport,CT. Our shares of common stock are thinly traded and our stockprice may be volatile.Because our common stock is thinly traded, its market pricemay fluctuate significantly more than the stock market in general or the stock prices of other companies listed on major stockexchanges. There were approximately 2,704,075 shares of our common stock held by non-affiliates as of December 31, 2013. Thus,our common stock will be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and, as a result, the tradingprice for shares of our common stock may be more volatile. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our commonstock may have a greater impact on the trading price for our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger.  "

The Company is a major supplier of products related to the “back-to-school” season, which occurs principally during the months of May, June, July and August. If this typical seasonal increase in sales of certain portions of the Company’s product line does not materialize, the Company could experience a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.To compete successfully, the Company must develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products that create consumer demand.The Company’s long-term success in the current competitive environment depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products that create and maintain consumer demand. The Company also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with the Company’s products. The Company’s strategy includes increased investment in new product development and increased focus on innovation. There are, nevertheless, numerous uncertainties inherent in successfully developing and commercializing innovative new products on a continuing basis, and new product launches may not provide expected growth results.9 The Company is subject to environmental regulation and environmental risks.The Company is subject to national, state, provincial and/or local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations and prohibitions on the discharge and emission of, and establish standards for the use, disposal and management of, certain materials and waste. These environmental laws and regulations also impose liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up sites, and certain damages resulting from present and past spills, disposals, or other releases of hazardous substances or materials. Environmental laws and regulations can be complex and may change often. Capital and operating expenses required to comply with environmental laws and regulations can be significant, and violations may result in substantial fines and penalties. In addition, environmental laws and regulations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, in the United States impose liability on several grounds for the investigation and cleanup of contaminated soil, ground water and buildings and for damages to natural resources on a wide range of properties. For example, contamination at properties formerly owned or operated by the Company, as well as at properties it will own and operate, and properties to which hazardous substances were sent by the Company, may result in liability for the Company under environmental laws and regulations. The costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance, or liability with respect to contamination in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Refer to Note 16 – Sale of Property - of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the environmental costs related to the sale of property by the Company.Our shares of common stock are thinly traded and our stock price may be volatile.Because our common stock is thinly traded, its market price may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market in general or the stock prices of other companies, listed on major stock exchanges. We believe there are 2,629,447 shares of our common stock held by non-affiliates as of December 31, 2012. Thus, our common stock will be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and as a result, the trading price for our shares of common stock may be more volatile. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price for our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger. "

The Company is subject to a number of significant risks that might cause the Company’s actual results to vary materially from its forecasts, targets or projections, including:·     achieving planned revenue and profit growth in each of the Company's business segments;·     changes in customer requirements and in the volume of sales to principal customers;·     the timing of orders and shipments;·     emergence of new competitors or consolidation of existing competitors; and·     industry demand fluctuations.The Company’s expectations for both short- and long-term future net revenues are based on the Company’s estimates of future demand. Orders from the Company’s principal customers are ultimately based on demand from end-users and end-user demand can be difficult to predict. Low end-user demand would negatively affect orders the Company receives from distributors and other principal customers which could, in turn adversely affect the Company’s revenues in any fiscal period. If the Company’s estimates of sales are not accurate and the Company experiences unforeseen variability in its revenues and operating results, the Company may be unable to adjust its expense levels accordingly and its profit margins could be adversely affected.6 A number of the Company’s products are sold through distributors and large retailers. No assurances can be given that any or all of such distributors or retailers will continue their relationships with the Company. Distributors and other significant retail customers cannot easily be replaced and the loss of revenues and the Company’s inability to reduce expenses to compensate for the loss of revenues could adversely affect the Company’s net revenues and profit margins. Uncertainty in the global economy could negatively impact our business.Uncertainty in the global economy could adversely affect our customers and our suppliers and businesses such as ours. In addition, any uncertainty could have a variety of negative effects on the Company such as reduction in revenues, increased costs, lower gross margin percentages, increased allowances for doubtful accounts and/or write-offs of accounts receivable and could otherwise have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Loss of a major customer could result in a decrease in the Company’s future sales and earnings.In 2011 and 2010, the Company had one customer that individually exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales. Net sales to this customer amounted to approximately 20% in 2011 and 21% in 2010. The Company anticipates that a limited number of customers may account for a substantial portion of its total net revenues for the foreseeable future. The loss of a major customer or a disruption in sales to such a customer could result in a decrease of the Company’s future sales and earnings.Reliance on foreign suppliers could adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company purchases the majority of its products from foreign manufacturing partners and, as a result, its business is exposed to risks due to:·     Increases in transportation costs;·     New or increased import duties;·     Transportation delays;·     Work stoppages;·     Capacity constraints;·     Poor quality; and·     Inflation and exchange rate fluctuations that could increase the cost of foreign manufactured goods.The loss of key management could adversely affect the Company’s ability to run its business.The Company’s success depends, to a large extent, on the continued service of its executive management team, operating officers and other key personnel. The Company must therefore continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and operating personnel sufficient to maintain its current business and support its projected growth.The Company’s inability to meet its staffing requirements in the future could adversely affect its results of operations.Failure to protect the Company’s proprietary rights or the costs of protecting these rights could adversely affect its business.The Company’s success depends in part on its ability to obtain patents and licenses and to preserve other intellectual property rights covering its products and processes. The Company has obtained certain domestic and foreign patents, and intends to continue to seek patents on its inventions when appropriate. The process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that pending patents related to any of the Company’s products will be issued, in which case the Company may not be able to legally prevent others from producing similar and/or compatible competing products. If other companies were to sell similar and/or compatible competing products, the Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the Company’s efforts to protect its intellectual property will be successful. Any infringement of the Company’s intellectual property or legal defense of such action could have a material adverse effect on the Company.The Company may need to raise additional capital to fund its operations.The Company’s management believes that, under current conditions,  the Company’s current cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by operations, together with the borrowing availability under its revolving loan agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, will be sufficient to fund planned operations for the next twelve months. However, if the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, it may be required to find additional funding sources. If adequate financing is unavailable or is unavailable on acceptable terms, the Company may be unable to maintain, develop or enhance its operations, products and services, take advantage of future opportunities or adequately respond to competitive pressures.7 The Company may not be able to maintain or to raise prices in response to inflation and increasing costs.Future market and competitive pressures may prohibit the Company from raising prices to offset increased product costs, freight costs and other inflationary items. The inability to pass these costs through to the Company’s customers could have a negative effect on its results of operations.The Company is subject to intense competition in all of the markets in which it competes.The Company’s products are sold in highly competitive markets. The Company believes that the principal points of competition in these markets are product innovation, quality, price, merchandising, design and engineering capabilities, product development, timeliness and completeness of delivery, conformity to customer specifications and post-sale support. Competitive conditions may require the Company to match or better competitors’ prices to retain business or market shares. The Company believes that its competitive position will depend on continued investment in innovation and product development, manufacturing and sourcing, quality standards, marketing and customer service and support. The Company’s success will depend in part on its ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various market categories in which it competes. The Company may not have sufficient resources to make the investments that may be necessary to anticipate those changing needs and the Company may not anticipate, identify, develop and market products successfully or otherwise be successful in maintaining its competitive position. There are no significant barriers to entry into the markets for most of the Company’s products.Product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect the Company's financial results and reputation.Claims for losses or injuries allegedly caused by some of the Company’s products arise in the ordinary course of its business. In addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments, product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the Company’s reputation in the marketplace or the value of its brands. The Company also could be required to recall possible defective products, which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although the Company maintains product liability insurance coverage, potential product liability claims are subject to a deductible or could be excluded under the terms of the policy.The Company’s business is subject to risks associated with seasonality which could adversely affect its cash flow, financial condition, or results of operations.The Company’s business, historically, has experienced higher sales volume in the second and third quarters of the calendar year, when compared to the first and fourth quarters.

RISK FACTORSTHE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT RISKS THAT MIGHT CAUSE THECOMPANY'S ACTUAL RESULTS TO VARY MATERIALLY FROM ITS FORECASTS, TARGETS ORPROJECTIONS, INCLUDING:     o    achieving planned revenue and profit growth in each of the Company's          business segments;     o    changes in customer requirements and in the volume of sales to          principal customers;     o    the timing of orders and shipments;     o    emergence of new competitors or consolidation of existing competitors;          and     o    industry demand fluctuations.The Company's expectations for both short- and long-term future net revenues arebased on the Company's estimates of future demand. Orders from the Company'sprincipal customers are ultimately based on demand from end-users and end-userdemand can be difficult to predict. Low end-user demand would negatively affectorders the Company receives from distributors and other principal customerswhich could, in turn adversely affect the Company's revenues in any fiscalperiod. If the Company's estimates of sales are not accurate and the Companyexperiences unforeseen variability in its revenues and operating results, theCompany may be unable to adjust its expense levels accordingly and its profitmargins could be adversely affected.A number of the Company's products are sold through distributors and largeretailers. No assurances can be given that any or all of such distributors orretailers will continue their relationships with the Company. Distributors andother significant retail customers cannot easily be replaced and the loss ofrevenues and the Company's inability to reduce expenses to compensate for theloss of revenues could adversely affect the Company's net revenues and profitmargins.                                                                             (5)LOSS OF A MAJOR CUSTOMER COULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN THE COMPANY'S FUTURESALES AND EARNINGS.Net sales to the Company's customers exceeding 10% of consolidated net salesamounted to approximately 27%, 29% and 41% of total net revenues for the yearsended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company anticipatesthat a limited number of customers may account for a substantial portion of itstotal net revenues for the foreseeable future. The loss of a major customer or adisruption in sales to such a customer could result in a decrease of theCompany's future sales and earnings.RELIANCE ON FOREIGN SUPPLIERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.The Company purchases the majority of its products from foreign manufacturingpartners and, as a result, its business is exposed to increased risks due to:     o    Increases in transportation costs;     o    New or increased import duties;     o    Transportation delays;     o    Work stoppages;     o    Capacity constraints;     o    Poor quality; and     o    Inflation and exchange rate fluctuations that could increase the cost          of foreign manufactured goods.THE LOSS OF KEY MANAGEMENT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO RUNITS BUSINESS.The Company's success depends, to a large extent, on the continued service ofits executive management team, operating officers and other key personnel. TheCompany must therefore continue to recruit, retain and motivate management andoperating personnel sufficient to maintain its current business and support itsprojected growth.The Company's inability to meet its staffing requirements in the future couldadversely affect its results of operations.FAILURE TO PROTECT THE COMPANY'S PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OR THE COSTS OF PROTECTINGTHESE RIGHTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS BUSINESS.The Company's success depends in part on its ability to obtain patents andlicenses and to preserve other intellectual property rights covering itsproducts and processes. The Company obtained certain domestic and foreignpatents, and intends to continue to seek patents on its inventions whenappropriate. The process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming andexpensive. There can be no assurance that pending patents related to any of theCompany's products will be issued, in which case the Company may not be able tolegally prevent others from producing similar and/or compatible competingproducts. If other companies were to sell similar and/or compatible products,the Company's results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore,there can be no assurance that the Company's efforts to protect its intellectualproperty will be successful. Any infringement of the Company's intellectualproperty or legal defense of such action could have a material adverse effect onthe Company.THE COMPANY MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO FUND ITS OPERATIONS.The Company's management believes that, under current conditions, the Company'scurrent cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by operations, together withthe borrowing availability under its revolving loan agreement with WachoviaBank, will be sufficient to fund planned operations for the next twelve months.However, if the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash from operations,it may be required to find additional funding sources. If adequate financing isunavailable or is unavailable on acceptable terms, the Company may be unable tomaintain, develop or enhance its operations, products and services, takeadvantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures.THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OR TO RAISE PRICES IN RESPONSE TOINFLATION AND INCREASING COSTS.Future market and competitive pressures may prohibit the Company from raisingprices to offset increased product costs, freight costs and other inflationaryitems. The inability to pass these costs through to the Company's customerscould have a negative impact on our results of operations.                                                                             (6)THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE OFFICE PRODUCTSMARKETPLACE.The Company's products are sold in highly competitive markets. The Companybelieves that the principal points of competition in these markets are productinnovation, quality, price, merchandising, design and engineering capabilities,product development, timeliness and completeness of delivery, conformity tocustomer specifications and post-sale support. Competitive conditions mayrequire the Company to match or better competitors' prices to retain business ormarket shares. The Company believes that its competitive position will depend oncontinued investment in innovation and product development, manufacturing andsourcing, quality standards, marketing and customer service and support. TheCompany's success will depend in part on its ability to anticipate and offerproducts that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers inthe various market categories in which it competes. The Company may not havesufficient resources to make the investments that may be necessary to anticipatethose changing needs and the Company may not anticipate, identify, develop andmarket products successfully or otherwise be successful in maintaining itscompetitive position. There are no significant barriers to entry into themarkets for most of the Company's products.PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS OR REGULATORY ACTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THECOMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS AND REPUTATION.Claims for losses or injuries allegedly caused by some of the Company's productsarise in the ordinary course of its business. In addition to the risk ofsubstantial monetary judgments, product liability claims or regulatory actionscould result in negative publicity that could harm the Company's reputation inthe marketplace or the value of its brands. The Company also could be requiredto recall possible defective products, which could result in adverse publicityand significant expenses. Although the Company maintains product liabilityinsurance coverage, potential product liability claims are subject to adeductible or could be excluded under the terms of the policy.THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SEASONALITY WHICHCOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR RESULTS OFOPERATIONS.The Company's business, historically, has experienced higher sales volume in thesecond and third quarters of the calendar year, when compared to the first andfourth quarters. Two principal factors have contributed to this seasonality: theoffice products industry's customers and the Company's product line. The Companyis a major supplier of products related to the ""back-to-school"" season, whichoccurs principally during the months of June, July, August and September. Ifthis typical seasonal increase in sales of certain portions of the Company'sproduct line does not materialize, the Company could experience a materialadverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY, THE COMPANY MUST DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE A CONTINUINGSTREAM OF INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCTS THAT CREATE CONSUMER DEMAND.The Company's long-term success in this competitive environment depends on itsability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative newproducts that create and maintain consumer demand. The Company also faces therisk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that competewith the Company's products. The Company's strategy includes increasedinvestment in new product development and increased focus on innovation. Thereare, nevertheless, numerous uncertainties inherent in successfully developingand commercializing innovative new products on a continuing basis, and newproduct launches may not deliver expected growth results.THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS.The Company is subject to national, state, provincial and/or local environmentallaws and regulations that impose limitations and prohibitions on the dischargeand emission of, and establish standards for the use, disposal and managementof, certain materials and waste. These environmental laws and regulations alsoimpose liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up sites, andcertain damages resulting from present and past spills, disposals, or otherreleases of hazardous substances or materials. Environmental laws andregulations can be complex and may change often. Capital and operating expensesrequired to comply with environmental laws and regulations can be significant,and violations may result in substantial fines and penalties. In addition,environmental laws and regulations, such as the Comprehensive EnvironmentalResponse, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, in the United States imposeliability on several grounds for the investigation and cleanup of contaminatedsoil, ground water and buildings and for damages to natural resources on a widerange of properties. For example, contamination at properties formerly owned oroperated by the Company, as well as at properties it will own and operate, andproperties to which hazardous substances were sent by the Company, may result inliability for the Company under environmental laws and regulations. The costs ofcomplying with environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerningnoncompliance, or liability with respect to contamination in the future couldhave a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or resultsof operations.
