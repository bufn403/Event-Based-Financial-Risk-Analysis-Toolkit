14,SPXC,SPX CORP,2024-02-23,"ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
(All currency and share amounts are in millions)You should consider the risks described below and elsewhere in our documents filed with the SEC before investing in any of our securities. We may amend, supplement or add to the risk factors described below from time to time in future reports filed with the SEC.Risks Related to our Markets and CustomersMany of the markets in which we operate are cyclical or are subject to industry events, and our results have been and could be affected as a result.Many of the markets in which we operate are subject to general economic cycles or industry events. In addition, certain of our businesses are subject to market-specific cycles.Furthermore, contract timing on projects, including those relating to communication technologies, transportation systems, aids to navigation products, and process cooling systems and towers may cause significant fluctuations in revenues and profits from period to period.The businesses of many of our customers are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced, and may continue to experience, periodic downturns. Cyclical changes and specific industry events could also affect sales of products in our other businesses. Downturns in the business cycles of our different operations may occur at the same time, which could exacerbate any adverse effects on our business. In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal and weather-related fluctuations, particularly within certain of our heating products businesses within our HVAC reportable segment. Historically, many of our key businesses generally have tended to have stronger performance in the second half of the year. See “MD&A - Results of Continuing Operations and Results of Reportable Segments.”Our business depends on capital investment and maintenance expenditures by our customers.Demand for most of our products and services depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by our customers. The level of capital expenditures by our customers fluctuates based on planned expansions, new builds and repairs, commodity prices, general economic conditions, availability of credit, and expectations of future market behavior. Although no one customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues, many of our businesses derive revenues from large projects or key customer relationships and any of the aforementioned factors, whether individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, in turn, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our customers have been and could be impacted by commodity availability and prices. A number of factors outside our control, including fluctuating commodity prices, impact the demand for our products. Increased commodity prices, including as a result of new or increased tariffs or the impact of new trade laws, may increase our customers’ cost of doing business, thus causing them to delay or cancel large capital projects.On the other hand, declining commodity prices may cause our customers to delay or cancel projects relating to the production of such commodities. Reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity, which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. Reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in the relevant market.We operate in highly competitive markets. Our failure to compete effectively could harm our business. We sell our products in highly competitive markets, which could result in pressure on our profit margins and limit our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products. We compete on a number of fronts, including on the basis of service, product performance, technical innovation and price. We have a number of competitors with substantial technological and financial resources, brand recognition and established relationships with global service providers. Some of our competitors have lower cost structures, support from local governments, or both. In addition, new competitors may enter the markets in which we participate. Competitors may be able to offer lower prices, additional products or services or a more attractive mix of products or services, or services or other incentives that we cannot or will not match. These competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new or emerging technologies and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns and make more attractive offers to potential customers, employees and strategic partners. In addition, competitive environments in slow-growth markets, to which some of our businesses have exposure, have been inherently more influenced by pricing and 7domestic and global economic conditions. To remain competitive, we need to invest in manufacturing, marketing, customer service and support, and our distribution networks. No assurances can be made that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make the investment required to maintain or increase our market share or that our investments will be successful. If we do not compete successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.Our business with various governments is subject to government contracting risks.Our business with government agencies, including sales to prime contractors that supply these agencies, is subject to government contracting risks. U.S. and other government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. In addition, if we or one of our divisions were charged with wrongdoing with respect to a U.S. government contract, the U.S. government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. If convicted or found liable, the U.S. government could subject us to fines, penalties, repayments and treble and other damages, and/or bar us from bidding on or receiving new awards of U.S. government contracts and void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. The U.S. government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct.Risks Related to our Suppliers and VendorsThe price and availability of raw materials and components has and may adversely affect our business. We are exposed to a variety of risks relating to the price and availability of raw materials and components. In recent years, we have faced volatility in the prices of many key raw materials (e.g., steel and oil) and key components (e.g., circuit boards), including price increases in response to trade laws and tariffs and shortages related to supply chain disruptions, including as a result of public health crises, geopolitical events or other factors. Increases in the prices of raw materials and components, including as a result of new or increased tariffs or the impact of new trade laws, or shortages or allocations of materials and components may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as there may be delays in our ability, or we may not be able, to pass cost increases on to our customers, or our sales may be reduced. We are subject to, or may enter into, long-term supplier contracts that may increase our exposure to pricing fluctuations.The fact that we outsource various elements of the products and services we sell subjects us to the business risks of our suppliers and subcontractors, which could have a material adverse impact on our operations.In areas where we depend on third-party suppliers and subcontractors for outsourced products, components or services, we are subject to the risk of customer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of the products or services we sell due to supplier or subcontractor failure. In addition, business difficulties experienced by a third-party supplier or subcontractor can lead to the interruption of our ability to obtain outsourced products or services and ultimately our inability to supply products or services to our customers. Third-party supplier and subcontractor business interruptions can include, but are not limited to, work stoppages, union negotiations and other labor disputes. Current economic conditions could also impact the ability of suppliers and subcontractors to access credit and, thus, impair their ability to provide us quality products or services in a timely manner, or at all.Risks Related to Our Manufacturing and OperationsCost overruns, inflation, delays and other risks could significantly impact our results, particularly with respect to fixed-price contracts.A portion of our revenues and earnings is generated through fixed-price contracts. We recognize revenues for certain of these contracts over time whereby revenues and expenses, and thereby profit, in a given period are determined based on our estimates as to the project status and the costs remaining to complete a particular project.Estimates of total revenues and cost at completion are subject to many variables, including the length of time to complete a contract. In addition, contract delays may negatively impact these estimates and our revenues and earnings results for affected periods.To the extent that we underestimate the remaining cost to complete a project, we may overstate the revenues and profit in a particular period. Further, certain of these contracts provide for penalties or liquidated damages for failure to timely perform our obligations under the contract, or require that we, at our expense, correct and remedy certain defects to the satisfaction of the 8other party. Because some of our contracts are at a fixed price, we face the risk that cost overruns or inflation may exceed, erode or eliminate our expected profit margin, or cause us to record a loss on our projects.Our operations are at risk of damage, destruction or disruption by natural disasters and other unexpected events.The loss of, or substantial damage to, one or more of our facilities, our information system infrastructure or the facilities of our suppliers could make it difficult to manufacture our products and fulfill customer orders. Severe weather events (such as flooding, tornadoes or hurricanes), earthquakes, tsunamis, fires, explosions, acts of war, terrorism, civil unrest, or outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics of infectious diseases (such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic) could adversely impact our operations.Risks Related to Acquisitions and DispositionsAcquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges.Our recent and future acquisitions involve a number of risks and may present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:•Adverse effects on our reported operating results due to charges to earnings, including potential impairment charges associated with goodwill and other intangibles;•Diversion of management attention from core business operations;•Integration of technology, operations, personnel and financial and other systems;•Increased expenses;•Increased foreign operations, often with unique issues relating to corporate culture, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and other challenges;•Assumption of known and unknown liabilities and exposure to litigation;•Increased levels of debt or dilution to existing stockholders;•Potential disputes with the sellers of acquired businesses; and•Potential cybersecurity risks, as acquired systems may not possess the appropriate security measures.We conduct operational, financial, tax, systems, and legal due diligence on all acquisitions; however, we cannot assure that all potential risks or liabilities are adequately discovered, disclosed, or understood in each instance.In addition, internal controls over financial reporting of acquired companies may not be compliant with required standards. Issues may exist that could rise to the level of significant deficiencies or, in some cases, material weaknesses, particularly with respect to foreign companies or non-public U.S. companies.Our integration activities may place substantial demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. Customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business, technology, service or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.Our failure to successfully complete acquisitions could negatively affect us.We may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions, which could materially impact our growth rate, results of operations, future cash flows and stock price. Our ability to achieve our goals depends upon, among other things, our ability to identify and successfully acquire companies, businesses and product lines, to effectively integrate them and to achieve cost savings. We may also be unable to raise additional funds necessary to consummate these acquisitions. In addition, decreases in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to consummate acquisitions. Competition for acquisitions in our business areas may be significant and result in higher prices for businesses, including businesses that we may target, which may also affect our acquisition rate or benefits achieved from our acquisitions.We may not achieve the expected cost savings and other benefits of our acquisitions.We strive for and expect to achieve cost savings in connection with our acquisitions, including: (i) manufacturing process and supply chain rationalization, (ii) streamlining redundant administrative overhead and support activities, (iii) restructuring and repositioning sales and marketing organizations to eliminate redundancies, and (iv) achieving anticipated revenue synergies. Cost savings expectations are estimates that are inherently difficult to predict and are necessarily speculative in nature, and we cannot assure you that we will achieve expected, or any, cost savings in connection with an acquisition. In addition, we cannot assure you that unforeseen factors will not offset the estimated cost savings or other benefits from our acquisitions. As a result, anticipated benefits could be delayed, differ significantly from our estimates and the other information contained in this report, or not be realized.9Dispositions or liabilities retained in connection with dispositions could negatively affect us.Our dispositions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from running our core businesses, increased expense associated with the dispositions, potential disputes with the customers or suppliers of the disposed businesses, potential disputes with the acquirers of the disposed businesses and a potential dilutive effect on our earnings per share.If dispositions are not completed in a timely manner, there may be a negative effect on our cash flows and/or our ability to execute our strategy. In addition, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of our dispositions. See “Business,” “MD&A - Results of Discontinued Operations,” and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for the status of our divestitures.We have divested a number of businesses, including the Spin-Off in 2015. With respect to some of these former businesses, we have contractually agreed to indemnify the counterparties against, or otherwise retain, certain liabilities, including certain lawsuits, tax liabilities, product liability claims, and environmental matters. Even without ongoing contractual indemnification obligations, we could be exposed to liabilities arising out of the businesses for certain activities prior to the divestitures. In addition, certain of the counterparties to those divestitures and/or the divested businesses have agreed to indemnify us or assume certain liabilities relating to those divestitures. However, there can be no assurance that the indemnity or assumption of liability by the counterparties or divested businesses will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of these liabilities, or that a counterparty or divested business will be able to fully satisfy its obligations. Third parties also could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that a counterparty or divested business agreed to assume. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering any amounts for which we were initially held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves.Risks Related to Macro-Economic, Domestic and World EventsGovernmental laws and regulations could negatively affect our business.Changes in laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject could have a significant negative impact on our business. In addition, we could face material costs and risks if it is determined that we have failed to comply with relevant laws and regulations. We are subject to U.S. Customs and Export Regulations, including U.S. International Traffic and Arms Regulations and similar laws, which collectively control import, export and sale of technologies by companies and various other aspects of the operation of our business; the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws, which prohibit companies from making improper payments to government officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business; the California Transparency in Supply Chain Act and similar laws and regulations, which relate to human trafficking and anti-slavery and impose new compliance requirements on our businesses and their suppliers; and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and the European General Data Protection Regulation, which establish data management requirements for the protection of personal information of individuals. While our policies and procedures mandate compliance with such laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees and agents will always act in strict compliance. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations may result in civil and criminal enforcement, including monetary fines and possible injunctions against shipment of product or other of our activities, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Several of our businesses are reliant on or may be directly impacted by government regulations. Changes to these regulations may have a significant negative impact on these businesses. For example, (i) a reduction of Federal Aviation Administration regulations mandating lighting of towers and buildings at height; (ii) increases in Department of Energy regulations on energy efficiency requirements for heating, and (iii) a reduction in regulations requiring 811 calls to be made before the commencement of a digging project, could have a significant negative impact on these businesses. While we monitor these regulations and our businesses’ plan for potential changes, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt in each circumstance. Failure to adapt if regulations change could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Difficulties presented by domestic economic, political, legal, accounting and business factors could negatively affect our business.In 2023, approximately 84% of our revenues were generated inside the United States. Our reliance on U.S. revenues and U.S. manufacturing bases exposes us to a number of risks, including:•Government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions such as antidumping duties, as well as the imposition of trade sanctions by the United States against a class of products imported from or sold and exported to, or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with, countries in which we conduct business, could significantly increase our cost of products imported into or exported from the United States or reduce our sales and harm our business and the relaxation of 10embargoes and foreign trade restrictions by the United States could adversely affect the market for our products in the United States;•Customs and tariffs may make it difficult or impossible for us to move our products or assets across borders in a cost-effective manner and may increase the cost of our raw materials, including raw materials sourced domestically;•Transportation and shipping expenses may add additional cost to our products;•Complications related to shipping, including delays due to weather, labor action, or customs, may impact our profit margins or lead to lost business;•Environmental and other laws and regulations could increase our costs or limit our ability to run our business; and•Our ability to obtain supplies from foreign vendors and ship products internationally may be impaired during times of crisis or otherwise.Any of the above factors or other factors affecting the movement of people and products into and from various countries to North America could have a significant negative effect on our operations. In addition, our concentration on U.S. business may make it difficult to enter new markets, making it more difficult for our businesses to grow.Worldwide economic conditions could negatively impact our businesses.Many of our customers historically have tended to delay capital projects, including expensive maintenance and upgrades, during economic downturns. Poor macroeconomic conditions could negatively impact our businesses by adversely affecting, among other things, our: •Revenues;•Margins;•Profits;•Cash flows;•Customers’ orders, including order cancellation activity or delays on existing orders;•Customers’ ability to access credit;•Customers’ ability to pay amounts due to us; and•Suppliers’ and distributors’ ability to perform and the availability and costs of materials and subcontracted services.Downturns in global economies could negatively impact our results of operations and prospects. In addition, economic instabilities resulting from geopolitical activities, including instabilities associated with the armed conflict in Ukraine, and the imposition of governmental sanctions in response thereto, and any conflict or threat of conflict that may affect Taiwan or any other nations, could negatively impact our results of operations and prospects. Our non-U.S. revenues and operations expose us to numerous risks that may negatively impact our business.To the extent we generate revenues outside of the United States, non-U.S. revenues and non-U.S. manufacturing bases expose us to a number of risks, including:•Significant competition could come from local or long-term participants in non-U.S. markets who may have significantly greater market knowledge and substantially greater resources than we do;•Local customers may have a preference for locally-produced products;•Credit risk or financial condition of local customers and distributors could affect our ability to market our products or collect receivables;•Regulatory or political systems or barriers may make it difficult or impossible to enter or remain in new markets. In addition, these barriers may impact our existing businesses, including making it more difficult for them to grow;•Local political, economic and social conditions, including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions, political instability, nationalization of private enterprises, or unexpected changes relating to currency could adversely impact our revenues and operations;•Customs, tariffs and trade restrictions may make it difficult or impossible for us to move our products or assets across borders in a cost-effective manner;•Transportation and shipping expenses may add additional cost to our products;•Complications related to shipping, including delays due to weather, labor action, or customs, may impact our profit margins or lead to lost business;•Local, regional or worldwide hostilities, including armed conflicts, could impact our operations;•Distance and language and cultural differences may make it more difficult to manage our business and employees and to effectively market our products and services; and•Public health crises, including the outbreak of a pandemic or other contagious disease.11Any of the above factors or other factors affecting social and economic activity in the United Kingdom and China or affecting the movement of people and products into and from these countries to our major markets, could have a significant negative effect on our operations.Climate change and legal or regulatory responses thereto may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.There is growing concern that increases in global average temperatures as a result of increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause significant adverse long-term climate changes, as well as more near-term changes in weather patterns that could adversely impact our operations. Moreover, growing concern over climate change may result in additional legal or regulatory requirements to disclose levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions or that are designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment. Many of our manufacturing plants and the products we manufacture, particularly in the HVAC reportable segment, use significant amounts of electricity generated by burning fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide. Additionally, many of the products we manufacture in the HVAC reportable segment use natural gas or oil as a fuel source and may be subject to increasing regulatory restrictions aimed at “de-carbonization” or the elimination of such fuel sources. Increased energy or compliance costs and expenses as a result of increased legal or regulatory requirements may cause disruptions in, or an increase in the costs associated with, the manufacturing and distribution of our products and we may be required to develop product improvements to satisfy developing energy-efficiency targets in order to remain competitive. In addition, the impacts of climate change and legal or regulatory initiatives to address climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. If we fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress on environmental and sustainability programs and initiatives or fail to develop product improvements to satisfy developing energy-efficiency targets, the results could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Failure to meet evolving expectations for reporting on environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) matters could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.Expectations from investors, customers, team members, government agencies and other third parties concerning ESG reporting have increased, and our ability to meet those expectations is dependent on a variety of factors, including cooperation from sourcing vendors and other third parties and having access to consistent and reliable data. Negative customer perceptions regarding the safety and sourcing of the products we sell and the sufficiency and transparency of our reporting on such matters and events that give rise to actual, potential, or perceived sustainability, social responsibility and similar concerns could hurt our reputation, result in lost sales, cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs and make it difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customers. Furthermore, costs associated with responding to ESG related laws, regulations, or customer requirements may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.Risks Related to Information, Technology and CybersecurityIf we are unable to protect our information systems and networks against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted. We are increasingly dependent on cloud-based and other information technology (“IT”) systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information. We depend on such IT infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and between our personnel and suppliers and customers. In addition, we rely on these IT systems to record, process, summarize, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including, among other things, our accounting and financial reporting processes; our manufacturing and supply chain processes; our sales and marketing efforts; and the data related to our research and development efforts. The failure of our IT systems or those of our business partners or third-party service providers to perform properly, or difficulties encountered in the development of new systems or the upgrade of existing systems, could disrupt our business and harm our reputation, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess or obsolete inventory, and product shortages, causing our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results to suffer. Upon expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third-party vendors, we may not be able to replace the services provided to us in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable to us, and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete.IT security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cyber-attacks on our IT systems and networks. Cyber-attacks may be random, coordinated, or targeted, including sophisticated computer crime threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, and those of our business partners and third-party service providers, and to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. Despite our implementation of security measures, cybersecurity threats, such as malicious software, ransomware, phishing attacks, computer viruses, and attempts to gain unauthorized access, cannot be completely mitigated. Our business, reputation, operating results, 12and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if, as a result of a significant cyber event or otherwise, our operations or industrial processes are disrupted or shutdown; our confidential, proprietary information is stolen or disclosed; the performance or security of our cloud-based product offerings is impacted; our intranet and internet sites are compromised; data is manipulated or destroyed; we incur costs or are required to pay fines in connection with stolen customer, employee, or other confidential information; we must dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection; or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs.In addition, newer generations of certain of our products include IT systems, including systems that are cloud-based and/or interconnect through the internet. These systems are subject to the same cybersecurity threats described above and the failure of these systems, including by cyber-attack, could disrupt our customers’ business, leading to potential exposure for us.Operation on multiple Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) information systems and other applications may negatively impact our operations and internal control environment.We are highly dependent on our information systems infrastructure to prepare customer quotes, process orders, purchase materials, track inventory, ship products in a timely manner, prepare invoices to our customers, maintain internal controls, produce financial data, and otherwise carry on our businesses in the ordinary course. From time to time we also undertake projects to implement new, or update existing, ERP systems and other applications. While we believe we have the experience, skill and management abilities, as well as access to the necessary experts and consultants, to plan and execute these projects without significant disruption to our businesses, ERP and other application implementations and updates are very complex and inherently subject to risks and uncertainty. There is no assurance that the projects will succeed or that failures in the design, programming, software or implementation of these projects will not cause significant disruption to our businesses. Such a disruption could cause project cost overruns, which may be significant, losses in revenue, increases in operating costs, and reduced customer satisfaction, all of which would lead to a decline in profitability over the short term and possibly the long term. In addition, as the Company continues to pursue inorganic growth opportunities through acquisitions, our inability to properly assess the acquired ERP systems and other applications and, where necessary, implement upgrades or replacements, may prevent us from maximizing the value and realizing the synergies of those newly acquired businesses and ensuring the operating effectiveness of our internal control processes.Our technology is important to our success, and failure to develop new products or make the appropriate investment in technology advancements may result in the loss of any sustainable competitive advantage in products, services and processes.We believe the development of our intellectual property rights is critical to the success of our business. In order to maintain our market positions and margins, we need to regularly develop and introduce high-quality, technologically advanced and cost-effective products on a timely basis, in many cases in multiple jurisdictions around the world. Information technology systems, platforms and products are critical to our operating environment, product offerings and competitive position. Certain digitalization initiatives important to our long-term success may require capital investment, have significant risks associated with their execution, and could take several years to implement. If we do not accurately predict, prepare and respond to new technology innovations, market developments and changing customer needs, our revenues, profitability and long-term competitiveness could be materially adversely affected.Failure to protect or unauthorized use of our intellectual property may harm our business.Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology or knowledge, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as in the United States. Costs incurred to defend our rights may be material.Risks Related to Contingent LiabilitiesOur current and planned products may contain defects or errors that are detected only after delivery to customers. If that occurs, our reputation may be harmed and we may face additional costs.We cannot assure you that our product development, manufacturing and integration testing will be adequate to detect all defects, errors, failures and quality issues that could impact customer satisfaction or result in claims against us with regard to our products. As a result, we may have, and from time to time have had, to replace certain components and/or provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects in products that are shipped. The occurrence of any defects, errors, failures or quality issues could result in cancellation of orders, product returns, diversion of our resources, legal actions by our customers or our customers’ end users and other losses to us or to any of our customers or end users, and could also result in the loss of or delay in 13market acceptance of our products and loss of sales, which would harm our business and adversely affect our revenues, profitability and cash flows.We are subject to potential liability relating to claims, complaints and proceedings, including those relating environmental, product liability and other matters.We are subject to various laws, ordinances, regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the United States and other nations. Additionally, changes in laws, ordinances, regulations, or other governmental policies may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities.Certain claims, complaints, and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business have been asserted or are pending against us or certain of our subsidiaries (collectively, “claims”). These claims relate to litigation matters, environmental matters, product liability matters, and other risk management matters (e.g., general liability, automobile, and workers’ compensation claims). Periodically, claims, complaints and proceedings arising other than in the ordinary course of business have been asserted or are pending against us or certain of our subsidiaries (e.g. patent infringement), including claims with respect to businesses that we have acquired for matters arising before the relevant date of the acquisition. From time to time, we face actions by governmental authorities, both in and outside the United States. Additionally, we may become subject to other claims of which we are currently unaware, which may be significant, or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring significantly greater loss than we anticipate. Our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable (e.g., because of insurer insolvency) to protect us against potential loss exposures.We face environmental exposures including, for example, those relating to discharges from and materials handled as part of our operations, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by petroleum products or hazardous substances or wastes, and the health and safety of our employees. We may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal, or remediation of hazardous substances or petroleum products on, under, or in our current or formerly owned or leased properties, or from third-party disposal facilities that we may have used, without regard to whether we knew of, or caused, the presence of the contaminants. The presence of, or failure to properly remediate, these substances may have adverse effects, including, for example, substantial investigative or remedial obligations and limitations on the ability to sell or rent affected property or to borrow funds using affected property as collateral. New or existing environmental matters or changes in environmental laws or policies could lead to material costs for environmental compliance or cleanup. In addition, environmentally related product regulations are growing globally in number and complexity and could contribute to increased costs with respect to disclosure requirements, product sales and distribution related costs, and post-sale recycling and disposal costs. There can be no assurance that these liabilities and costs will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.See “MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates - Contingent Liabilities” and Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Risks Related to Human Capital ResourcesThe loss of key personnel and an inability to attract and retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations.We are dependent on the continued services of our leadership teams. The loss of these personnel without adequate replacement could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience in many locations in order to operate our business successfully. From time to time, there may be a shortage of qualified managers or skilled labor, which may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain qualified employees. If we were unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals or our costs to do so were to increase significantly, our operations could be materially adversely affected.We are subject to work stoppages, union negotiations, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force, which may adversely impact our operations and cause us to incur incremental costs.At December 31, 2023, we had six domestic collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 460 of our over 4,100 employees. Four of these collective bargaining agreements expire in 2024 and are scheduled for negotiation and renewal. We also have various collective labor arrangements covering certain non-U.S. employee groups. We are subject to potential union campaigns, work stoppages, union negotiations and other potential labor disputes. Further, we may be subject to work stoppages, which are beyond our control, at our suppliers or customers.14Risks Related to Financial MattersWe may not be able to finance future needs or adapt our business plan to react to changes in economic or business conditions because of restrictions placed on us by our senior credit facilities and any existing or future instruments governing our other indebtedness.Our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain, or future or revised instruments may contain, various restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, and make investments unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied. We also must comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests. Our subsidiaries may also be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us. In addition, our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain or may contain additional affirmative and negative covenants. Material existing restrictions are described more fully in the “MD&A - Liquidity and Financial Condition - Senior Credit Facilities” and Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. Each of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities, such as acquisitions.If we do not comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness, we could default under those agreements, and the debt, together with accrued interest, could be declared due and payable. If we default under our senior credit facilities, the lenders could cause all our outstanding debt obligations under our senior credit facilities to become due and payable or require us to repay the indebtedness under these facilities. If our debt is accelerated, we may not be able to repay or refinance our debt. In addition, any default under our senior credit facilities or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. If the indebtedness under our senior credit facilities is accelerated, we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due under our senior credit facilities or other debt securities then outstanding. Our ability to comply with these provisions of our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness will be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control. Complying with our covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to us and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete, including against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.A significant portion of our debt accrues interest at variable rates and increases in applicable benchmark interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.Our profitability and cash flows may be adversely affected during any periods of unexpected or rapid increases in interest rates. We maintain a credit agreement with both term loan facilities and a revolving credit facility. Borrowings under these facilities accrue interest at either an alternate base rate or Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement. A significant increase in Term SOFR or the other benchmark rates used in determining the alternative base rate would significantly increase our cost of borrowings. Further, any changes in regulatory standards or industry practices, such as the discontinuation of the use of Term SOFR and/or the transition to alternative benchmark rates may result in the usage of higher interest rates under the credit agreement, and our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected. We are also exposed to risks if the U.S. Federal Reserve raises its benchmark interest rate, which may reduce the availability of, and increase the cost of, obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness.For additional information related to this risk, see Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”Currency conversion risk could have a material impact on our reported results of business operations. Our operating results are presented in U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in which we conduct business could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into U.S. dollars.Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, including countries utilizing the Euro, which may have a material adverse effect on sales or require us to lower our prices, and also decrease our reported revenues or margins related to sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent we are unable or determine not to increase local currency prices. Likewise, the increased strength of the U.S. dollar could allow competitors with foreign-based manufacturing costs to sell their products in the U.S. at lower prices. Alternatively, decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased overseas.Similarly, increased or decreased strength of the currencies of non-U.S. countries in which we manufacture will have a comparable effect against the currencies of other jurisdictions in which we sell. For example, our Radiodetection business manufactures a number of detection instruments in the United Kingdom and sells to customers in other countries, therefore increased strength of the British pound sterling will increase the effective price of these products sold in British pound sterling 15into other countries; and decreased strength of British pound sterling could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased outside of the United Kingdom.Credit and counterparty risks could harm our business.The financial condition of our customers and distributors could affect our ability to market our products or collect receivables. In addition, financial difficulties faced by our customers may lead to cancellations or delays of orders.Our customers may suffer financial difficulties that make them unable to pay for a project when completed, or they may decide not or be unable to pay us, either as a matter of corporate decision-making or in response to changes in local laws and regulations. We cannot assure you that expenses or losses for uncollectible amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows.Commodity, currency and interest rate hedging activities may adversely impact our financial performance as a result of changes in relevant commodity prices, interest rates and currency rates.We use derivative financial instruments in order to reduce the substantial effects of currency and commodity fluctuations and interest rate exposure on our cash flow and financial condition. These instruments may include foreign currency and commodity forward contracts, currency swap agreements and currency option contracts, as well as interest rate swap agreements. We have entered into, and may continue to enter into, such hedging arrangements. By utilizing hedging instruments, we may forgo benefits that might result from fluctuations in currency exchange, commodity and interest rates. We are also exposed to the risk that counterparties to hedging contracts will default on their obligations. A default by such counterparties in performing their obligations under these hedging instruments could have an adverse effect on us.Changes in tax laws and regulations or other factors could cause our income tax obligations to increase, potentially reducing our net income and adversely affecting our cash flows.We are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions around the world. In preparing our financial statements, we provide for income taxes based on current tax laws and regulations and the estimated taxable income within each of these jurisdictions. Our income tax obligations, however, may be higher due to numerous factors, including changes in tax laws or regulations and the outcome of audits and examinations of our tax returns.Officials in some of the jurisdictions in which we do business have proposed, or announced that they are reviewing, tax changes that could potentially increase taxes, and other revenue-raising laws and regulations, including those that may be enacted as a result of various OECD projects. Changes in applicable U.S. or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.As indicated in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements, certain of our income tax returns are currently under audit. In connection with these and any future audits, there is a risk that we could be challenged by tax authorities on certain of the tax positions we have taken, or will take, on our tax returns. Although we believe that current tax laws and regulations support our positions, there can be no assurance that tax authorities will agree with our positions. In the event tax authorities were to challenge one or more of our tax positions, an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. If the fair value of any of our reporting units is insufficient to recover the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets of the respective reporting unit, a material non-cash charge to earnings could result.At December 31, 2023, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net, of $1,385.6. We conduct annual impairment testing to determine if we will be able to recover all or a portion of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. In addition, we review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment more frequently if impairment indicators arise. If the fair value is insufficient to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we may be required to record a material non-cash charge to earnings.The fair values of our reporting units generally are based on discounted cash flow projections that are believed to be reasonable under current and forecasted circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of the reported net assets of our reporting units. Other considerations are also incorporated, including comparable price multiples. Many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets that they serve. Accordingly, we consider estimates and judgments that affect the future cash flow projections, including principal methods of competition such as volume, price, service, product performance and technical innovations and estimates associated with cost reduction initiatives, capacity utilization, and assumptions for inflation and foreign currency changes. We monitor impairment indicators across all of our businesses. Significant changes in market conditions and estimates or judgments used to determine expected future cash 16flows that indicate a reduction in carrying value may give, and have given, rise to impairments in the period that the change becomes known.Cost reduction actions may affect our business.Cost reduction actions often result in charges against earnings. These charges can vary significantly from period to period and, as a result, we may experience fluctuations in our reported net income and earnings per share due to the timing of cost reduction actions.Changes in key estimates and assumptions related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, such as discount rates, assumed long-term return on assets, assumed long-term trends of future cost, and accounting and legislative changes, as well as actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and other actuarial factors, could affect our results of operations and cash flows.We have defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, including both qualified and non-qualified plans, which cover a portion of our salaried and hourly employees and retirees, including a portion of our employees and retirees in foreign countries. As of December 31, 2023, our net liability to these plans was $100.1. The determination of funding requirements and pension expense or income associated with these plans involves significant judgment, particularly with respect to discount rates, long-term trends of future costs and other actuarial assumptions. If our assumptions change significantly due to changes in economic, legislative and/or demographic experience or circumstances, our pension and other benefit plans’ expense, funded status and our required cash contributions to such plans could be negatively impacted. In addition, returns on plan assets could have a material impact on our pension plans’ expense, funded status and our required contributions to the plans. Changes in regulations or law could also significantly impact our obligations. For example, see “MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates” for the impact that changes in certain assumptions used in the calculation of our costs and obligations associated with these plans could have on our results of operations and financial position.Our incurrence of additional indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.At December 31, 2023, we had $558.3 in total indebtedness. On that same date, we had $489.2 of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities, after giving effect to $10.8 reserved for outstanding letters of credit. In addition, at December 31, 2023, we had $13.4 of available issuance capacity under our foreign credit instrument facilities after giving effect to $11.6 reserved for outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2023, our cash and equivalents balance was $104.9. See “MD&A - Liquidity and Financial Condition - Borrowings” and Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance, or assumed in connection with, acquisitions. We may renegotiate or refinance our senior credit facilities or other debt facilities, or enter into additional agreements that have different or more stringent terms. Increases in the level of our indebtedness relative to our cash balances could:•Impact our ability to obtain new, or refinance existing, indebtedness, on favorable terms or at all;•Limit our ability to obtain, or obtain on favorable terms, additional debt financing for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions;•Limit our flexibility in reacting to competitive and other changes in the industry and economic conditions;•Limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock in the future;•Coupled with a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows due to economic developments or adverse developments in our business, make it difficult to meet debt service requirements; and•Expose us to interest rate fluctuations to the extent existing borrowings are, and any new borrowings may be, at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expense and interest payments in the event of increases in interest rates.Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal or pay interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors beyond our control. In addition, we cannot assure you that future borrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, whether in the ordinary course of business or upon an acceleration of such indebtedness, we may pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, revising implementation of or delaying strategic plans or seeking additional equity capital. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. In addition, we cannot assure that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements, or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements.Numerous banks in many countries are syndicate members in our credit facility. Failure of one or more of our larger lenders, or several of our smaller lenders, could significantly reduce availability of our credit, which could harm our liquidity.17Failure of our internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our business and financial results.Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud.  Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockProvisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company, and accordingly, we may not consummate a transaction that our stockholders consider favorable.Provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws may inhibit changes in control of our company not approved by our Board. These provisions include, for example: a classified board of directors with directors serving staggered three-year terms; a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent; a requirement that special stockholder meetings be called only by our Chairman, President or Board; advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations; limitations on stockholders’ ability to amend, alter or repeal the By-laws; enhanced voting requirements for certain business combinations involving substantial stockholders; the authority of our Board to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with terms determined in its discretion; and limitations on stockholders’ ability to remove directors. In addition, we are afforded the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could have similar effects. In general, Section 203 prohibits us from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” (each as defined in Section 203) for at least three years after the time the person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met. These protective provisions could result in our not consummating a transaction that our stockholders consider favorable or discourage entities from attempting to acquire us, potentially at a significant premium to our then-existing stock price.Increases in the number of shares of our outstanding common stock could adversely affect our common stock price or dilute our earnings per share.Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock into the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. As of December 31, 2023, we had the ability to issue up to an additional 3.597 shares as restricted stock units, performance stock units, or stock options under our 2019 Stock Compensation Plan. We also may issue a significant number of additional shares, in connection with acquisitions, through a registration statement, or otherwise. Additional shares issued would have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share"
10,SPXC,SPX CORP,2023-02-24,"ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
(All currency and share amounts are in millions)You should consider the risks described below and elsewhere in our documents filed with the SEC before investing in any of our securities. We may amend, supplement or add to the risk factors described below from time to time in future reports filed with the SEC.Risks Related to our Markets and CustomersMany of the markets in which we operate are cyclical or are subject to industry events, and our results have been and could be affected as a result.Many of the markets in which we operate are subject to general economic cycles or industry events. In addition, certain of our businesses are subject to market-specific cycles.Furthermore, contract timing on projects, including those relating to communication technologies, fare collection systems, obstruction lighting products, and process cooling systems and towers may cause significant fluctuations in revenues and profits from period to period.The businesses of many of our customers are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced, and may continue to experience, periodic downturns. Cyclical changes and specific industry events could also affect sales of products in our other businesses. Downturns in the business cycles of our different operations may occur at the same time, which could exacerbate any adverse effects on our business. In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal and weather-related fluctuations. Historically, many of our key businesses generally have tended to have stronger performance in the second half of the year. See “MD&A - Results of Continuing Operations and Results of Reportable Segments.”Our business depends on capital investment and maintenance expenditures by our customers.Demand for most of our products and services depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by our customers. The level of capital expenditures by our customers fluctuates based on planned expansions, new builds and repairs, commodity prices, general economic conditions, availability of credit, and expectations of future market behavior. Any of these factors, whether individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, in turn, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our customers have been and could be impacted by commodity availability and prices. A number of factors outside our control, including fluctuating commodity prices, impact the demand for our products. Increased commodity prices, including as a result of new or increased tariffs or the impact of new trade laws, may increase our customers’ cost of doing business, thus causing them to delay or cancel large capital projects.On the other hand, declining commodity prices may cause our customers to delay or cancel projects relating to the production of such commodities. Reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity, which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. Reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in the relevant market.We operate in highly competitive markets. Our failure to compete effectively could harm our business. We sell our products in highly competitive markets, which could result in pressure on our profit margins and limit our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products. We compete on a number of fronts, including on the basis of service, product performance, technical innovation and price. We have a number of competitors with substantial technological and financial resources, brand recognition and established relationships with global service providers. Some of our competitors have lower cost structures, support from local governments, or both. In addition, new competitors may enter the markets in which we participate. Competitors may be able to offer lower prices, additional products or services or a more attractive mix of products or services, or services or other incentives that we cannot or will not match. These competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new or emerging technologies and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns and make more attractive offers to potential customers, employees and strategic partners. In addition, competitive environments in slow-growth markets, to which some of our businesses have exposure, have been inherently more influenced by pricing and domestic and global economic conditions. To remain competitive, we need to invest in manufacturing, marketing, customer service and support, and our distribution networks. No assurances can be made that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make the investment required to maintain or increase our market share or that our investments will be successful. If we do not 7compete successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.Our business with various governments is subject to government contracting risks.Our business with government agencies, including sales to prime contractors that supply these agencies, is subject to government contracting risks. U.S. and other government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. In addition, if we or one of our divisions were charged with wrongdoing with respect to a U.S. government contract, the U.S. government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. If convicted or found liable, the U.S. government could subject us to fines, penalties, repayments and treble and other damages, and/or bar us from bidding on or receiving new awards of U.S. government contracts and void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. The U.S. government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct.Risks Related to our Suppliers and VendorsThe price and availability of raw materials and components has and may adversely affect our business. We are exposed to a variety of risks relating to the price and availability of raw materials and components. In recent years, we have faced volatility in the prices of many key raw materials (e.g., steel and oil) and key components (e.g., circuit boards), including price increases in response to trade laws and tariffs and shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Increases in the prices of raw materials and components, including as a result of new or increased tariffs or the impact of new trade laws, or shortages or allocations of materials and components may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as there may be delays in our ability, or we may not be able, to pass cost increases on to our customers, or our sales may be reduced. We are subject to, or may enter into, long-term supplier contracts that may increase our exposure to pricing fluctuations.The fact that we outsource various elements of the products and services we sell subjects us to the business risks of our suppliers and subcontractors, which could have a material adverse impact on our operations.In areas where we depend on third-party suppliers and subcontractors for outsourced products, components or services, we are subject to the risk of customer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of the products or services we sell due to supplier or subcontractor failure. In addition, business difficulties experienced by a third-party supplier or subcontractor can lead to the interruption of our ability to obtain outsourced products or services and ultimately our inability to supply products or services to our customers. Third-party supplier and subcontractor business interruptions can include, but are not limited to, work stoppages, union negotiations and other labor disputes. Current economic conditions could also impact the ability of suppliers and subcontractors to access credit and, thus, impair their ability to provide us quality products or services in a timely manner, or at all.Risks Related to Our Manufacturing and OperationsCost overruns, inflation, delays and other risks could significantly impact our results, particularly with respect to fixed-price contracts.A portion of our revenues and earnings is generated through fixed-price contracts. We recognize revenues for certain of these contracts over time whereby revenues and expenses, and thereby profit, in a given period are determined based on our estimates as to the project status and the costs remaining to complete a particular project.Estimates of total revenues and cost at completion are subject to many variables, including the length of time to complete a contract. In addition, contract delays may negatively impact these estimates and our revenues and earnings results for affected periods.To the extent that we underestimate the remaining cost to complete a project, we may overstate the revenues and profit in a particular period. Further, certain of these contracts provide for penalties or liquidated damages for failure to timely perform our obligations under the contract, or require that we, at our expense, correct and remedy certain defects to the satisfaction of the other party. Because some of our contracts are at a fixed price, we face the risk that cost overruns or inflation may exceed, erode or eliminate our expected profit margin, or cause us to record a loss on our projects.8Our current and planned products may contain defects or errors that are detected only after delivery to customers. If that occurs, our reputation may be harmed and we may face additional costs.We cannot assure you that our product development, manufacturing and integration testing will be adequate to detect all defects, errors, failures and quality issues that could impact customer satisfaction or result in claims against us with regard to our products. As a result, we may have, and from time to time have had, to replace certain components and/or provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects in products that are shipped. The occurrence of any defects, errors, failures or quality issues could result in cancellation of orders, product returns, diversion of our resources, legal actions by our customers or our customers’ end users and other losses to us or to any of our customers or end users, and could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and loss of sales, which would harm our business and adversely affect our revenues, profitability and cash flows.Risks Related to Contingent LiabilitiesOur South African subsidiary is subject to various claims, disputes, enforcement actions, litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings related to two large power projects in South Africa that could ultimately be resolved against it.Since 2008, DBT had been executing on two large power projects in South Africa (Kusile and Medupi), on which it has now substantially completed its scope of work. Over such time, the business environment surrounding these projects was difficult, as DBT, along with many other contractors on the projects, experienced delays, cost over-runs, and various other challenges associated with a complex set of contractual relationships among the end customer, prime contractors, various subcontractors (including DBT and its subcontractors), and various suppliers. DBT is currently involved in a number of claims relating to these challenges and may be subject to other claims, which could be significant. SPX has provided parent company guarantees to certain counterparties in connection with these projects. We cannot give assurance that these claims and the costs to assert DBT's claims and defend claims against DBT will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See “MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates - Contingent Liabilities” and Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. We are subject to potential liability relating to claims, complaints and proceedings, including those relating environmental, product liability and other matters.We are subject to various laws, ordinances, regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the United States and other nations. Additionally, changes in laws, ordinances, regulations, or other governmental policies may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities.Certain claims, complaints, and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business have been asserted or are pending against us or certain of our subsidiaries (collectively, “claims”). These claims relate to litigation matters, environmental matters, product liability matters, and other risk management matters (e.g., general liability, automobile, and workers’ compensation claims). Periodically, claims, complaints and proceedings arising other than in the ordinary course of business have been asserted or are pending against us or certain of our subsidiaries (e.g. patent infringement), including claims with respect to businesses that we have acquired for matters arising before the relevant date of the acquisition. From time to time, we face actions by governmental authorities, both in and outside the United States. Additionally, we may become subject to other claims of which we are currently unaware, which may be significant, or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring significantly greater loss than we anticipate. Our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable (e.g., because of insurer insolvency) to protect us against potential loss exposures.We face environmental exposures including, for example, those relating to discharges from and materials handled as part of our operations, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by petroleum products or hazardous substances or wastes, and the health and safety of our employees. We may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal, or remediation of hazardous substances or petroleum products on, under, or in our current or formerly owned or leased properties, or from third-party disposal facilities that we may have used, without regard to whether we knew of, or caused, the presence of the contaminants. The presence of, or failure to properly remediate, these substances may have adverse effects, including, for example, substantial investigative or remedial obligations and limitations on the ability to sell or rent affected property or to borrow funds using affected property as collateral. New or existing environmental matters or changes in environmental laws or policies could lead to material costs for environmental compliance or cleanup. In addition, environmentally related product regulations are growing globally in number and complexity and could contribute to increased costs with respect to disclosure requirements, product sales and distribution related costs, and post-sale recycling and disposal costs. There can be no assurance that these liabilities and costs will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.9See “MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates - Contingent Liabilities” and Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Risks Related to Macro-Economic, Domestic and World EventsGovernmental laws and regulations could negatively affect our business.Changes in laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject could have a significant negative impact on our business. In addition, we could face material costs and risks if it is determined that we have failed to comply with relevant laws and regulations. We are subject to U.S. Customs and Export Regulations, including U.S. International Traffic and Arms Regulations and similar laws, which collectively control import, export and sale of technologies by companies and various other aspects of the operation of our business; the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws, which prohibit companies from making improper payments to government officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business; the California Transparency in Supply Chain Act and similar laws and regulations, which relate to human trafficking and anti-slavery and impose new compliance requirements on our businesses and their suppliers; and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and the European General Data Protection Regulation, which establish data management requirements for the protection of personal information of individuals. While our policies and procedures mandate compliance with such laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees and agents will always act in strict compliance. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations may result in civil and criminal enforcement, including monetary fines and possible injunctions against shipment of product or other of our activities, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Several of our businesses are reliant on or may be directly impacted by government regulations. Changes to these regulations may have a significant negative impact on these businesses. For example, (i) a reduction of Federal Aviation Administration regulations mandating lighting of towers and buildings at height; (ii) increases in Department of Energy regulations on energy efficiency requirements for heating, and (iii) a reduction in regulations requiring 811 calls to be made before the commencement of a digging project, could have a significant negative impact on these businesses. While we monitor these regulations and our businesses’ plan for potential changes, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt in each circumstance. Failure to adapt if regulations change could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Difficulties presented by domestic economic, political, legal, accounting and business factors could negatively affect our business.In 2022, approximately 84% of our revenues were generated inside the United States. Our reliance on U.S. revenues and U.S. manufacturing bases exposes us to a number of risks, including:•Government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions such as antidumping duties, as well as the imposition of trade sanctions by the United States against a class of products imported from or sold and exported to, or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with, countries in which we conduct business, could significantly increase our cost of products imported into or exported from the United States or reduce our sales and harm our business and the relaxation of embargoes and foreign trade restrictions by the United States could adversely affect the market for our products in the United States;•Customs and tariffs may make it difficult or impossible for us to move our products or assets across borders in a cost-effective manner and may increase the cost of our raw materials, including raw materials sourced domestically;•Transportation and shipping expenses add cost to our products;•Complications related to shipping, including delays due to weather, labor action, or customs, may impact our profit margins or lead to lost business;•Environmental and other laws and regulations could increase our costs or limit our ability to run our business; and•Our ability to obtain supplies from foreign vendors and ship products internationally may be impaired during times of crisis or otherwise.Any of the above factors or other factors affecting the movement of people and products into and from various countries to North America could have a significant negative effect on our operations. In addition, our concentration on U.S. business may make it difficult to enter new markets, making it more difficult for our businesses to grow.10Worldwide economic conditions could negatively impact our businesses.Many of our customers historically have tended to delay capital projects, including expensive maintenance and upgrades, during economic downturns. Poor macroeconomic conditions could negatively impact our businesses by adversely affecting, among other things, our: •Revenues;•Margins;•Profits;•Cash flows;•Customers’ orders, including order cancellation activity or delays on existing orders;•Customers’ ability to access credit;•Customers’ ability to pay amounts due to us; and•Suppliers’ and distributors’ ability to perform and the availability and costs of materials and subcontracted services.Downturns in global economies could negatively impact our results of operations and prospects. In addition, economic instabilities resulting from geopolitical activities, including instabilities associated with the armed conflict in Ukraine, and the imposition of governmental sanctions in response thereto, and any conflict or threat of conflict that may affect Taiwan, could negatively impact our results of operations and prospects. Our non-U.S. revenues and operations expose us to numerous risks that may negatively impact our business.To the extent we generate revenues outside of the United States, non-U.S. revenues and non-U.S. manufacturing bases exposes us to a number of risks, including:•Significant competition could come from local or long-term participants in non-U.S. markets who may have significantly greater market knowledge and substantially greater resources than we do;•Local customers may have a preference for locally-produced products;•Credit risk or financial condition of local customers and distributors could affect our ability to market our products or collect receivables;•Regulatory or political systems or barriers may make it difficult or impossible to enter or remain in new markets. In addition, these barriers may impact our existing businesses, including making it more difficult for them to grow;•Local political, economic and social conditions, including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions, political instability, nationalization of private enterprises, or unexpected changes relating to currency could adversely impact our revenues and operations;•Customs, tariffs and trade restrictions may make it difficult or impossible for us to move our products or assets across borders in a cost-effective manner;•Transportation and shipping expenses add cost to our products;•Complications related to shipping, including delays due to weather, labor action, or customs, may impact our profit margins or lead to lost business;•Local, regional or worldwide hostilities, including armed conflicts, could impact our operations;•Distance and language and cultural differences may make it more difficult to manage our business and employees and to effectively market our products and services; and•Public health crises, including the outbreak of a pandemic or other contagious disease.Any of the above factors or other factors affecting social and economic activity in the United Kingdom and China or affecting the movement of people and products into and from these countries to our major markets, could have a significant negative effect on our operations.Climate change and legal or regulatory responses thereto may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.There is growing concern that increases in global average temperatures as a result of increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause significant adverse long-term climate changes, as well as more near-term changes in weather patterns that could adversely impact our operations. Moreover, growing concern over climate change may result in additional legal or regulatory requirements to disclose levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions or that are designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment. Many of our manufacturing plants and the products we manufacture, particularly in the HVAC reportable segment, use significant amounts of electricity generated by burning fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide. Additionally, many of the products we manufacture in the HVAC reportable segment use natural gas or oil as a fuel source and may be subject to 11increasing regulatory restrictions aimed at “de-carbonization” or the elimination of such fuel sources.  Increased energy or compliance costs and expenses as a result of increased legal or regulatory requirements may cause disruptions in, or an increase in the costs associated with, the manufacturing and distribution of our products and we may be required to develop product improvements to satisfy developing energy-efficiency targets in order to remain competitive. In addition, the impacts of climate change and legal or regulatory initiatives to address climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. If we fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress on environmental and sustainability programs and initiatives or fail to develop product improvements to satisfy developing energy-efficiency targets, the results could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Risks Related to Information, Technology and CybersecurityIf we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted. We are increasingly dependent on cloud-based and other information technology (“IT”) networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information. We depend on such IT infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and between our personnel and suppliers and customers. In addition, we rely on these IT systems to record, process, summarize, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including, among other things, our accounting and financial reporting processes; our manufacturing and supply chain processes; our sales and marketing efforts; and the data related to our research and development efforts. The failure of our IT systems or those of our business partners or third-party service providers to perform properly, or difficulties encountered in the development of new systems or the upgrade of existing systems, could disrupt our business and harm our reputation, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess or obsolete inventory, and product shortages, causing our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results to suffer. Upon expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third-party vendors, we may not be able to replace the services provided to us in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable to us, and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete.IT security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication and we have detected numerous attempts to compromise the security of our IT systems. Cyber-attacks may be random, coordinated, or targeted, including sophisticated computer crime threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, and those of our business partners and third-party service providers, and to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. Despite our implementation of security measures, cybersecurity threats, such as malicious software, ransomware, phishing attacks, computer viruses, and attempts to gain unauthorized access, cannot be completely mitigated. Our business, reputation, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if, as a result of a significant cyber event or otherwise, our operations or industrial processes are disrupted or shutdown; our confidential, proprietary information is stolen or disclosed; the performance or security of our cloud-based product offerings is impacted; our intranet and internet sites are compromised; data is manipulated or destroyed; we incur costs or are required to pay fines in connection with stolen customer, employee, or other confidential information; we must dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection; or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs.In addition, newer generations of certain of our products include IT systems, including systems that are cloud-based and/or interconnect through the internet. These systems are subject to the same cybersecurity threats described above and the failure of these systems, including by cyber-attack, could disrupt our customers’ business, leading to potential exposure for us.Our technology is important to our success, and failure to develop new products or make the appropriate investment in technology advancements may result in the loss of any sustainable competitive advantage in products, services and processes.We believe the development of our intellectual property rights is critical to the success of our business. In order to maintain our market positions and margins, we need to regularly develop and introduce high-quality, technologically advanced and cost-effective products on a timely basis, in many cases in multiple jurisdictions around the world. Information technology systems, platforms and products are critical to our operating environment, product offerings and competitive position. Certain digitalization initiatives important to our long-term success may require capital investment, have significant risks associated with their execution, and could take several years to implement. If we do not accurately predict, prepare and respond to new technology innovations, market developments and changing customer needs, our revenues, profitability and long-term competitiveness could be materially adversely affected.12Failure to protect or unauthorized use of our intellectual property may harm our business.Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology or knowledge, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as in the United States. Costs incurred to defend our rights may be material.Risks Related to Acquisitions and DispositionsAcquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges.Our recent and future acquisitions involve a number of risks and may present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:•Adverse effects on our reported operating results due to charges to earnings, including potential impairment charges associated with goodwill and other intangibles;•Diversion of management attention from core business operations;•Integration of technology, operations, personnel and financial and other systems;•Increased expenses;•Increased foreign operations, often with unique issues relating to corporate culture, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and other challenges;•Assumption of known and unknown liabilities and exposure to litigation;•Increased levels of debt or dilution to existing stockholders;•Potential disputes with the sellers of acquired businesses; and•Potential cybersecurity risks, as acquired systems may not possess the appropriate security measures.We conduct operational, financial, tax, systems, and legal due diligence on all acquisitions; however, we cannot assure that all potential risks or liabilities are adequately discovered, disclosed, or understood in each instance.In addition, internal controls over financial reporting of acquired companies may not be compliant with required standards. Issues may exist that could rise to the level of significant deficiencies or, in some cases, material weaknesses, particularly with respect to foreign companies or non-public U.S. companies.Our integration activities may place substantial demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. Customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business, technology, service or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.Our failure to successfully complete acquisitions could negatively affect us.We may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions, which could materially impact our growth rate, results of operations, future cash flows and stock price. Our ability to achieve our goals depends upon, among other things, our ability to identify and successfully acquire companies, businesses and product lines, to effectively integrate them and to achieve cost savings. We may also be unable to raise additional funds necessary to consummate these acquisitions. In addition, decreases in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to consummate acquisitions. Competition for acquisitions in our business areas may be significant and result in higher prices for businesses, including businesses that we may target, which may also affect our acquisition rate or benefits achieved from our acquisitions.We may not achieve the expected cost savings and other benefits of our acquisitions.We strive for and expect to achieve cost savings in connection with our acquisitions, including: (i) manufacturing process and supply chain rationalization, (ii) streamlining redundant administrative overhead and support activities, (iii) restructuring and repositioning sales and marketing organizations to eliminate redundancies, and (iv) achieving anticipated revenue synergies. Cost savings expectations are estimates that are inherently difficult to predict and are necessarily speculative in nature, and we cannot assure you that we will achieve expected, or any, cost savings in connection with an acquisition. In addition, we cannot assure you that unforeseen factors will not offset the estimated cost savings or other benefits from our acquisitions. As a result, anticipated benefits could be delayed, differ significantly from our estimates and the other information contained in this report, or not be realized.13Dispositions or liabilities retained in connection with dispositions could negatively affect us.Our dispositions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from running our core businesses, increased expense associated with the dispositions, potential disputes with the customers or suppliers of the disposed businesses, potential disputes with the acquirers of the disposed businesses and a potential dilutive effect on our earnings per share.If dispositions are not completed in a timely manner, there may be a negative effect on our cash flows and/or our ability to execute our strategy. In addition, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of our dispositions. See “Business,” “MD&A - Results of Discontinued Operations,” and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for the status of our divestitures.We have divested a number of businesses, including the Spin-Off in 2015. With respect to some of these former businesses, we have contractually agreed to indemnify the counterparties against, or otherwise retain, certain liabilities, including, certain lawsuits, tax liabilities, product liability claims, and environmental matters. Even without ongoing contractual indemnification obligations, we could be exposed to liabilities arising out of the businesses for certain activities prior to the divestitures. In addition, certain of the counterparties to those divestitures and/or the divested businesses have agreed to indemnify us or assume certain liabilities relating to those divestitures. However, there can be no assurance that the indemnity or assumption of liability by the counterparties or divested businesses will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of these liabilities, or that a counterparty or divested business will be able to fully satisfy its obligations. Third parties also could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that a counterparty or divested business agreed to assume. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering any amounts for which we were initially held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves.Risks Related to the COVID-19 PandemicThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our business.The COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations in the first half of 2020, with diminishing impacts during the second half of 2020 and during 2021 and 2022. The COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse impact on our business and consolidated financial results during 2023 and we are unable to determine the extent, duration, or nature at this time. The intensity, duration and governmental responses to the pandemic, as well as the pace of vaccination efforts and the emergence of new variants of the virus that cause COVID-19, are all highly uncertain and could contribute to the ultimate impact on our business. Specifically, the COVID-19 pandemic could impact:•Our suppliers’ ability to perform and the availability of materials and subcontractors’ services;•Our customers’ ability to access credit and to pay amounts due to us;•Our distributors’ ability to perform; and•Our ability to:◦Access credit;◦Meet contractual deadlines with customers, which could result in delays in payments from customers and customers possibly seeking delay damages;◦Complete acquisitions due to potential adverse impacts on targeted businesses or product lines; and◦Meet the financial covenants under our senior credit and other debt agreements.The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted, and could continue to result, in:•Disruptions in our supply chain or increased costs for certain components or commodities;•Labor shortages and difficulties filling the positions within our organization;•A prolonged reduction in the demand for certain of our products;•A prolonged shut-down of one or more of our facilities either due to exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic or to further restrictive government orders;•Asset impairment charges;•A loss of productivity, greater cybersecurity risk and other fraud risks, and difficulties in maintaining internal controls over financial reporting due to the impact of employees working remotely;•An adverse impact to the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans, which could result in additional funding requirements for the plans;14•The diversion of management’s attention from core business operations; and•Restructuring charges if we decide to reduce headcount as a result of a decline in customer demand.Any of the above risks could have a material adverse impact on our business and consolidated financial results.Risks Related to Human Capital ResourcesThe loss of key personnel and an inability to attract and retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations.We are dependent on the continued services of our leadership team. The loss of these personnel without adequate replacement could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience in many locations in order to operate our business successfully. From time to time, there may be a shortage of qualified managers or skilled labor, which may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain qualified employees. If we were unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals or our costs to do so were to increase significantly, our operations could be materially adversely affected.We are subject to work stoppages, union negotiations, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force, which may adversely impact our operations and cause us to incur incremental costs.At December 31, 2022, we had six domestic collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 340 of our over 3,300 employees. Three of these collective bargaining agreements expire in 2023 and are scheduled for negotiation and renewal. We also have various collective labor arrangements covering certain non-U.S. employee groups. We are subject to potential union campaigns, work stoppages, union negotiations and other potential labor disputes. Further, we may be subject to work stoppages, which are beyond our control, at our suppliers or customers.Risks Related to Financial MattersWe may not be able to finance future needs or adapt our business plan to react to changes in economic or business conditions because of restrictions placed on us by our senior credit facilities and any existing or future instruments governing our other indebtedness.Our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain, or future or revised instruments may contain, various restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied. We also must comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests. Our subsidiaries may also be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us. In addition, our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain or may contain additional affirmative and negative covenants. Material existing restrictions are described more fully in the “MD&A - Liquidity and Financial Condition - Senior Credit Facilities” and Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. Each of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities, such as acquisitions.If we do not comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness, we could default under those agreements, and the debt, together with accrued interest, could be declared due and payable. If we default under our senior credit facilities, the lenders could cause all our outstanding debt obligations under our senior credit facilities to become due and payable or require us to repay the indebtedness under these facilities. If our debt is accelerated, we may not be able to repay or refinance our debt. In addition, any default under our senior credit facilities or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. If the indebtedness under our senior credit facilities is accelerated, we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due under our senior credit facilities or other debt securities then outstanding. Our ability to comply with these provisions of our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness will be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control. Complying with our covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to us and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete, including against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.Currency conversion risk could have a material impact on our reported results of business operations. Our operating results are presented in U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in which we conduct business could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into U.S. dollars.15Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, including countries utilizing the Euro, which may have a material adverse effect on sales or require us to lower our prices, and also decrease our reported revenues or margins related to sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent we are unable or determine not to increase local currency prices. Likewise, the increased strength of the U.S. dollar could allow competitors with foreign-based manufacturing costs to sell their products in the U.S. at lower prices. Alternatively, decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased overseas.Similarly, increased or decreased strength of the currencies of non-U.S. countries in which we manufacture will have a comparable effect against the currencies of other jurisdictions in which we sell. For example, our Radiodetection business manufactures a number of detection instruments in the United Kingdom and sells to customers in other countries, therefore increased strength of the British pound sterling will increase the effective price of these products sold in British pound sterling into other countries; and decreased strength of British pound sterling could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased outside of the United Kingdom.Credit and counterparty risks could harm our business.The financial condition of our customers and distributors could affect our ability to market our products or collect receivables. In addition, financial difficulties faced by our customers may lead to cancellations or delays of orders.Our customers may suffer financial difficulties that make them unable to pay for a project when completed, or they may decide not or be unable to pay us, either as a matter of corporate decision-making or in response to changes in local laws and regulations. We cannot assure you that expenses or losses for uncollectible amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows.Changes in tax laws and regulations or other factors could cause our income tax obligations to increase, potentially reducing our net income and adversely affecting our cash flows.We are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions around the world. In preparing our financial statements, we provide for income taxes based on current tax laws and regulations and the estimated taxable income within each of these jurisdictions. Our income tax obligations, however, may be higher due to numerous factors, including changes in tax laws or regulations and the outcome of audits and examinations of our tax returns.Officials in some of the jurisdictions in which we do business have proposed, or announced that they are reviewing, tax changes that could potentially increase taxes, and other revenue-raising laws and regulations, including those that may be enacted as a result of various OECD projects. Changes in applicable U.S. or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.As indicated in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements, certain of our income tax returns are currently under audit. In connection with these and any future audits, there is a risk that we could be challenged by tax authorities on certain of the tax positions we have taken, or will take, on our tax returns. Although we believe that current tax laws and regulations support our positions, there can be no assurance that tax authorities will agree with our positions. In the event tax authorities were to challenge one or more of our tax positions, an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. If the fair value of any of our reporting units is insufficient to recover the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets of the respective reporting unit, a material non-cash charge to earnings could result.At December 31, 2022, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net, of $856.9. We conduct annual impairment testing to determine if we will be able to recover all or a portion of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. In addition, we review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment more frequently if impairment indicators arise. If the fair value is insufficient to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, we may be required to record a material non-cash charge to earnings.The fair values of our reporting units generally are based on discounted cash flow projections that are believed to be reasonable under current and forecasted circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of the reported net assets of our reporting units. Other considerations are also incorporated, including comparable price multiples. Many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets that they serve. Accordingly, we consider estimates and judgments that affect the future cash flow projections, including principal methods of competition such as volume, price, service, product performance and technical innovations and estimates associated with cost reduction initiatives, capacity utilization, and assumptions for inflation and foreign currency changes. We monitor impairment indicators across all of 16our businesses. Significant changes in market conditions and estimates or judgments used to determine expected future cash flows that indicate a reduction in carrying value may give, and have given, rise to impairments in the period that the change becomes known.Cost reduction actions may affect our business.Cost reduction actions often result in charges against earnings. These charges can vary significantly from period to period and, as a result, we may experience fluctuations in our reported net income and earnings per share due to the timing of cost reduction actions.Changes in key estimates and assumptions related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, such as discount rates, assumed long-term return on assets, assumed long-term trends of future cost, and accounting and legislative changes, as well as actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and other actuarial factors, could affect our results of operations and cash flows.We have defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, including both qualified and non-qualified plans, which cover a portion of our salaried and hourly employees and retirees, including a portion of our employees and retirees in foreign countries. As of December 31, 2022, our net liability to these plans was $95.8. The determination of funding requirements and pension expense or income associated with these plans involves significant judgment, particularly with respect to discount rates, long-term trends of future costs and other actuarial assumptions. If our assumptions change significantly due to changes in economic, legislative and/or demographic experience or circumstances, our pension and other benefit plans’ expense, funded status and our required cash contributions to such plans could be negatively impacted. In addition, returns on plan assets could have a material impact on our pension plans’ expense, funded status and our required contributions to the plans. Changes in regulations or law could also significantly impact our obligations. For example, see “MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates” for the impact that changes in certain assumptions used in the calculation of our costs and obligations associated with these plans could have on our results of operations and financial position.Our incurrence of additional indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.At December 31, 2022, we had $246.8 in total indebtedness. On that same date, we had $489.0 of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities, after giving effect to $11.0 reserved for outstanding letters of credit. In addition, at December 31, 2022, we had $10.2 of available issuance capacity under our foreign credit instrument facilities after giving effect to $14.8 reserved for outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2022, our cash and equivalents balance was $157.1. See “MD&A - Liquidity and Financial Condition - Borrowings” and Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance, or assumed in connection with, acquisitions. We may renegotiate or refinance our senior credit facilities or other debt facilities, or enter into additional agreements that have different or more stringent terms. Increases in the level of our indebtedness relative to our cash balances could:•Impact our ability to obtain new, or refinance existing, indebtedness, on favorable terms or at all;•Limit our ability to obtain, or obtain on favorable terms, additional debt financing for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions;•Limit our flexibility in reacting to competitive and other changes in the industry and economic conditions;•Limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock in the future;•Coupled with a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows due to economic developments or adverse developments in our business, make it difficult to meet debt service requirements; and•Expose us to interest rate fluctuations to the extent existing borrowings are, and any new borrowings may be, at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expense and interest payments in the event of increases in interest rates.Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal or pay interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors beyond our control. In addition, we cannot assure you that future borrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, whether in the ordinary course of business or upon an acceleration of such indebtedness, we may pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, revising implementation of or delaying strategic plans or seeking additional equity capital. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. In addition, we cannot assure that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements, or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements.Numerous banks in many countries are syndicate members in our credit facility. Failure of one or more of our larger lenders, or several of our smaller lenders, could significantly reduce availability of our credit, which could harm our liquidity.17Failure of our internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our business and financial results.Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud.  Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockProvisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company, and accordingly, we may not consummate a transaction that our stockholders consider favorable.Provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws may inhibit changes in control of our company not approved by our Board. These provisions include, for example: a classified board of directors with directors serving staggered three-year terms; a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent; a requirement that special stockholder meetings be called only by our Chairman, President or Board; advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations; limitations on stockholders’ ability to amend, alter or repeal the By-laws; enhanced voting requirements for certain business combinations involving substantial stockholders; the authority of our Board to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with terms determined in its discretion; and limitations on stockholders’ ability to remove directors. In addition, we are afforded the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could have similar effects. In general, Section 203 prohibits us from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” (each as defined in Section 203) for at least three years after the time the person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met. These protective provisions could result in our not consummating a transaction that our stockholders consider favorable or discourage entities from attempting to acquire us, potentially at a significant premium to our then-existing stock price.Increases in the number of shares of our outstanding common stock could adversely affect our common stock price or dilute our earnings per share.Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock into the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. As of December 31, 2022, we had the ability to issue up to an additional 3.851 shares as restricted stock units, performance stock units, or stock options under our 2019 Stock Compensation Plan. We also may issue a significant number of additional shares, in connection with acquisitions, through a registration statement, or otherwise. Additional shares issued would have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share"
5,SPXC,SPX CORP,2022-02-25,"ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
(All currency and share amounts are in millions)You should consider the risks described below and elsewhere in our documents filed with the SEC before investing in any of our securities. We may amend, supplement or add to the risk factors described below from time to time in future reports filed with the SEC.Risks Related to the COVID-19 PandemicThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our business.The COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations in the first half of 2020, with diminishing impacts during the second half of 2020 and during 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse impact on our business and consolidated financial results during 2022 and we are unable to determine the extent, duration, or nature at this time. The intensity, duration and governmental responses to the pandemic, as well as the pace of vaccination efforts and the emergence of new variants of the virus that cause COVID-19, are all highly uncertain and could contribute to the ultimate impact on our business. Specifically, the COVID-19 pandemic could impact:•Our suppliers’ ability to perform and the availability of materials and subcontractors’ services;•Our customers’ ability to access credit and to pay amounts due to us;•Our distributors’ ability to perform; and•Our ability to:◦Access credit;◦Meet contractual deadlines with customers, which could result in delays in payments from customers and customers possibly seeking delay damages;◦Complete acquisitions due to potential adverse impacts on targeted businesses or product lines; and◦Meet the financial covenants under our senior credit and other debt agreements.The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted, and could continue to result, in:•Disruptions in our supply chain or increased costs for certain components or commodities;•Labor shortages and difficulties filling the positions within our organization;•A prolonged reduction in the demand for certain of our products;•A prolonged shut-down of one or more of our facilities either due to exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic or to further restrictive government orders;•Asset impairment charges;•A loss of productivity, greater cybersecurity risk and other fraud risks, and difficulties in maintaining internal controls over financial reporting due to the impact of employees working remotely;•An adverse impact to the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans, which could result in (i) a material charge during the fourth quarter of 2022 and (ii) on a longer-term, additional funding requirements for the plans;•The diversion of management’s attention from core business operations; and•Restructuring charges if we decide to reduce headcount as a result of a decline in customer demand.Any of the above risks could have a material adverse impact on our business and consolidated financial results.Risks Related to Contingent LiabilitiesOur South African subsidiary is subject to various claims, disputes, enforcement actions, litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings related to two large power projects in South Africa that could ultimately be resolved against it.Since 2008, DBT had been executing on two large power projects in South Africa (Kusile and Medupi), on which it has now substantially completed its scope of work. Over such time, the business environment surrounding these projects was difficult, as DBT, along with many other contractors on the projects, experienced delays, cost over-runs, and various other challenges associated with a complex set of contractual relationships among the end customer, prime contractors, various 6subcontractors (including DBT and its subcontractors), and various suppliers. DBT is currently involved in a number of claims relating to these challenges and may be subject to other claims, which could be significant. SPX has provided parent company guarantees to certain counterparties in connection with these projects. We cannot give assurance that these claims and the costs to assert DBT's claims and defend claims against DBT will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See “MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates - Contingent Liabilities” and Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. We are subject to potential liability relating to claims, complaints and proceedings, including those relating to asbestos, environmental, product liability and other matters.We are subject to various laws, ordinances, regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the United States and other nations. Additionally, changes in laws, ordinances, regulations, or other governmental policies may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities.Numerous claims, complaints, and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business have been asserted or are pending against us or certain of our subsidiaries (collectively, “claims”). These claims relate to litigation matters (e.g., class actions and contracts, intellectual property, and competitive claims), environmental matters, product liability matters (predominately associated with alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials), and other risk management matters (e.g., general liability, automobile, and workers’ compensation claims). Periodically, claims, complaints and proceedings arising other than in the ordinary course of business have been asserted or are pending against us or certain of our subsidiaries (e.g. patent infringement), including claims with respect to businesses that we have acquired for matters arising before the relevant date of the acquisition. From time to time, we face actions by governmental authorities, both in and outside the United States. Additionally, we may become subject to other claims of which we are currently unaware, which may be significant, or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring significantly greater loss than we anticipate. Our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable (e.g., because of insurer insolvency) to protect us against potential loss exposures.The liabilities we record for asbestos product liability matters are based on a number of assumptions, including historical claims and payment experience and actuarial estimates of the future period during which additional claims are reasonably foreseeable.  While we base our assumptions on facts currently known to us, they entail inherently subjective judgments and uncertainties.  As a result, our current assumptions for estimating these liabilities may not prove accurate, and we may be required to adjust these liabilities in the future, including as a result of our change in relevant assumptions, which could result in material charges to earnings.  In addition, a significant increase in claims, costs, and/or issues with existing insurance coverage could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We face environmental exposures including, for example, those relating to discharges from and materials handled as part of our operations, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by petroleum products or hazardous substances or wastes, and the health and safety of our employees. We may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal, or remediation of hazardous substances or petroleum products on, under, or in our current or formerly owned or leased properties, or from third-party disposal facilities that we may have used, without regard to whether we knew of, or caused, the presence of the contaminants. The presence of, or failure to properly remediate, these substances may have adverse effects, including, for example, substantial investigative or remedial obligations and limitations on the ability to sell or rent affected property or to borrow funds using affected property as collateral. New or existing environmental matters or changes in environmental laws or policies could lead to material costs for environmental compliance or cleanup. In addition, environmentally related product regulations are growing globally in number and complexity and could contribute to increased costs with respect to disclosure requirements, product sales and distribution related costs, and post-sale recycling and disposal costs. There can be no assurance that these liabilities and costs will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.We devote significant time and expense to defend against the various claims, complaints, and proceedings brought against us. In addition, from time to time, we bring actions to enforce our rights against customers, suppliers, insurers, and other third parties. We cannot assure you that the expenses or distractions from operating our businesses arising from these defenses and actions will not increase materially.We cannot assure you that our accruals and right to indemnity and insurance will be sufficient, that recoveries from insurance or indemnification claims will be available or that any of our current or future claims or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.See “MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates - Contingent Liabilities” and Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.7Risks Related to our Markets and CustomersMany of the markets in which we operate are cyclical or are subject to industry events, and our results have been and could be affected as a result.Many of the markets in which we operate are subject to general economic cycles or industry events. In addition, certain of our businesses are subject to market-specific cycles.Furthermore, contract timing on projects, including those relating to communication technologies, fare collection systems, and process cooling systems and towers may cause significant fluctuations in revenues and profits from period to period.The businesses of many of our customers are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced, and may continue to experience, periodic downturns. Cyclical changes and specific industry events could also affect sales of products in our other businesses. Downturns in the business cycles of our different operations may occur at the same time, which could exacerbate any adverse effects on our business. In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal and weather-related fluctuations. Historically, many of our key businesses generally have tended to have stronger performance in the second half of the year. See “MD&A - Results of Continuing Operations and Results of Reportable Segments.”Our business depends on capital investment and maintenance expenditures by our customers.Demand for most of our products and services depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by our customers. The level of capital expenditures by our customers fluctuates based on planned expansions, new builds and repairs, commodity prices, general economic conditions, availability of credit, and expectations of future market behavior. Any of these factors, whether individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, in turn, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our customers have been and could be impacted by commodity availability and prices. A number of factors outside our control, including fluctuating commodity prices, impact the demand for our products. Increased commodity prices, including as a result of new or increased tariffs or the impact of new trade laws, may increase our customers’ cost of doing business, thus causing them to delay or cancel large capital projects.On the other hand, declining commodity prices may cause our customers to delay or cancel projects relating to the production of such commodities. Reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity, which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. Reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in the relevant market.We operate in highly competitive markets. Our failure to compete effectively could harm our business. We sell our products in highly competitive markets, which could result in pressure on our profit margins and limit our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products. We compete on a number of fronts, including on the basis of service, product performance, technical innovation and price. We have a number of competitors with substantial technological and financial resources, brand recognition and established relationships with global service providers. Some of our competitors have lower cost structures, support from local governments, or both. In addition, new competitors may enter the markets in which we participate. Competitors may be able to offer lower prices, additional products or services or a more attractive mix of products or services, or services or other incentives that we cannot or will not match. These competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new or emerging technologies and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns and make more attractive offers to potential customers, employees and strategic partners. In addition, competitive environments in slow-growth markets, to which some of our businesses have exposure, have been inherently more influenced by pricing and domestic and global economic conditions. To remain competitive, we need to invest in manufacturing, marketing, customer service and support, and our distribution networks. No assurances can be made that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make the investment required to maintain or increase our market share or that our investments will be successful. If we do not compete successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.8Risks Related to our Suppliers and VendorsThe price and availability of raw materials and components has and may adversely affect our business. We are exposed to a variety of risks relating to the price and availability of raw materials and components. In recent years, we have faced volatility in the prices of many key raw materials (e.g., steel and oil) and key components (e.g. circuit boards), including price increases in response to trade laws and tariffs and shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Increases in the prices of raw materials and components, including as a result of new or increased tariffs or the impact of new trade laws, or shortages or allocations of materials and components may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as there may be delays in our ability, or we may not be able, to pass cost increases on to our customers, or our sales may be reduced. We are subject to, or may enter into, long-term supplier contracts that may increase our exposure to pricing fluctuations.The fact that we outsource various elements of the products and services we sell subjects us to the business risks of our suppliers and subcontractors, which could have a material adverse impact on our operations.In areas where we depend on third-party suppliers and subcontractors for outsourced products, components or services, we are subject to the risk of customer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of the products or services we sell due to supplier or subcontractor failure. In addition, business difficulties experienced by a third-party supplier or subcontractor can lead to the interruption of our ability to obtain outsourced products or services and ultimately our inability to supply products or services to our customers. Third-party supplier and subcontractor business interruptions can include, but are not limited to, work stoppages, union negotiations and other labor disputes. Current economic conditions could also impact the ability of suppliers and subcontractors to access credit and, thus, impair their ability to provide us quality products or services in a timely manner, or at all.Risks Related to Information, Technology and CybersecurityIf we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted. We are increasingly dependent on cloud-based and other information technology (“IT”) networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information. We depend on such IT infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and between our personnel and suppliers and customers. In addition, we rely on these IT systems to record, process, summarize, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including, among other things, our accounting and financial reporting processes; our manufacturing and supply chain processes; our sales and marketing efforts; and the data related to our research and development efforts. The failure of our IT systems or those of our business partners or third-party service providers to perform properly, or difficulties encountered in the development of new systems or the upgrade of existing systems, could disrupt our business and harm our reputation, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess or obsolete inventory, and product shortages, causing our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results to suffer. Upon expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third-party vendors, we may not be able to replace the services provided to us in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable to us, and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete.IT security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication and we have detected numerous attempts to compromise the security of our IT systems. Cyber-attacks may be random, coordinated, or targeted, including sophisticated computer crime threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, and those of our business partners and third-party service providers, and to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. Despite our implementation of security measures, cybersecurity threats, such as malicious software, ransomware, phishing attacks, computer viruses, and attempts to gain unauthorized access, cannot be completely mitigated. Our business, reputation, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if, as a result of a significant cyber event or otherwise, our operations or industrial processes are disrupted or shutdown; our confidential, proprietary information is stolen or disclosed; the performance or security of our cloud-based product offerings is impacted; our intranet and internet sites are compromised; data is manipulated or destroyed; we incur costs or are required to pay fines in connection with stolen customer, employee, or other confidential information; we must dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection; or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs.9In addition, newer generations of certain of our products include IT systems, including systems that are cloud-based and/or interconnect through the internet. These systems are subject to the same cybersecurity threats described above and the failure of these systems, including by cyber-attack, could disrupt our customers’ business, leading to potential exposure for us.Our technology is important to our success, and failure to develop new products or make the appropriate investment in technology advancements may result in the loss of any sustainable competitive advantage in products, services and processes.We believe the development of our intellectual property rights is critical to the success of our business. In order to maintain our market positions and margins, we need to regularly develop and introduce high-quality, technologically advanced and cost-effective products on a timely basis, in many cases in multiple jurisdictions around the world. Information technology systems, platforms and products are critical to our operating environment, product offerings and competitive position. Certain digitalization initiatives important to our long-term success may require capital investment, have significant risks associated with their execution, and could take several years to implement. If we do not accurately predict, prepare and respond to new technology innovations, market developments and changing customer needs, our revenues, profitability and long-term competitiveness could be materially adversely affected.Failure to protect or unauthorized use of our intellectual property may harm our business.Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology or knowledge, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as in the United States. Costs incurred to defend our rights may be material.Risks Related to Our Manufacturing and OperationsCost overruns, inflation, delays and other risks could significantly impact our results, particularly with respect to fixed-price contracts.A portion of our revenues and earnings is generated through fixed-price contracts, particularly within our HVAC reportable segment. We recognize revenues for certain of these contracts over-time whereby revenues and expenses, and thereby profit, in a given period are determined based on our estimates as to the project status and the costs remaining to complete a particular project.Estimates of total revenues and cost at completion are subject to many variables, including the length of time to complete a contract. In addition, contract delays may negatively impact these estimates and our revenues and earnings results for affected periods.To the extent that we underestimate the remaining cost to complete a project, we may overstate the revenues and profit in a particular period. Further, certain of these contracts provide for penalties or liquidated damages for failure to timely perform our obligations under the contract, or require that we, at our expense, correct and remedy certain defects to the satisfaction of the other party. Because some of our contracts are at a fixed price, we face the risk that cost overruns or inflation may exceed, erode or eliminate our expected profit margin, or cause us to record a loss on our projects.Our current and planned products may contain defects or errors that are detected only after delivery to customers. If that occurs, our reputation may be harmed and we may face additional costs.We cannot assure you that our product development, manufacturing and integration testing will be adequate to detect all defects, errors, failures and quality issues that could impact customer satisfaction or result in claims against us with regard to our products. As a result, we may have, and from time to time have had, to replace certain components and/or provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects in products that are shipped. The occurrence of any defects, errors, failures or quality issues could result in cancellation of orders, product returns, diversion of our resources, legal actions by our customers or our customers’ end users and other losses to us or to any of our customers or end users, and could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and loss of sales, which would harm our business and adversely affect our revenues, profitability and cash flows.10Risks Related to Macro-Economic, Domestic and World EventsGovernmental laws and regulations could negatively affect our business.Changes in laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject could have a significant negative impact on our business. In addition, we could face material costs and risks if it is determined that we have failed to comply with relevant laws and regulations. We are subject to U.S. Customs and Export Regulations, including U.S. International Traffic and Arms Regulations and similar laws, which collectively control import, export and sale of technologies by companies and various other aspects of the operation of our business; the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws, which prohibit companies from making improper payments to government officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business; the California Transparency in Supply Chain Act and similar laws and regulations, which relate to human trafficking and anti-slavery and impose new compliance requirements on our businesses and their suppliers; and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and the European General Data Protection Regulation, which establish data management requirements for the protection of personal information of individuals. While our policies and procedures mandate compliance with such laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees and agents will always act in strict compliance. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations may result in civil and criminal enforcement, including monetary fines and possible injunctions against shipment of product or other of our activities, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Several of our businesses are reliant on or may be directly impacted by government regulations. Changes to these regulations may have a significant negative impact on these businesses. For example, (i) a reduction of Federal Aviation Administration regulations mandating lighting of towers and buildings at height; (ii) increases in Department of Energy regulations on energy efficiency requirements for heating, and (iii) a reduction in regulations requiring 811 calls to be made before the commencement of a digging project, could have a significant negative impact on these businesses. While we monitor these regulations and our businesses plan for potential changes, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt in each circumstance. Failure to adapt if regulations change could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Difficulties presented by domestic economic, political, legal, accounting and business factors could negatively affect our business.In 2021, approximately 81% of our revenues were generated inside the United States. Our reliance on U.S. revenues and U.S. manufacturing bases exposes us to a number of risks, including:•Government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions such as antidumping duties, as well as the imposition of trade sanctions by the United States against a class of products imported from or sold and exported to, or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with, countries in which we conduct business, could significantly increase our cost of products imported into or exported from the United States or reduce our sales and harm our business and the relaxation of embargoes and foreign trade restrictions, by the United States could adversely affect the market for our products in the United States;•Customs and tariffs may make it difficult or impossible for us to move our products or assets across borders in a cost-effective manner and may increase the cost of our raw materials, including raw materials sourced domestically;•Transportation and shipping expenses add cost to our products;•Complications related to shipping, including delays due to weather, labor action, or customs, may impact our profit margins or lead to lost business;•Environmental and other laws and regulations could increase our costs or limit our ability to run our business; and•Our ability to obtain supplies from foreign vendors and ship products internationally may be impaired during times of crisis or otherwise.Any of the above factors or other factors affecting the movement of people and products into and from various countries to North America could have a significant negative effect on our operations. In addition, our concentration on U.S. business may make it difficult to enter new markets, making it more difficult for our businesses to grow.Worldwide economic conditions could negatively impact our businesses.Many of our customers historically have tended to delay capital projects, including expensive maintenance and upgrades, during economic downturns. Poor macroeconomic conditions could negatively impact our businesses by adversely affecting, among other things, our: •Revenues;•Margins;•Profits;11•Cash flows;•Customers’ orders, including order cancellation activity or delays on existing orders;•Customers’ ability to access credit;•Customers’ ability to pay amounts due to us; and•Suppliers’ and distributors’ ability to perform and the availability and costs of materials and subcontracted services.Downturns in global economies could negatively impact our performance or any expectations in reporting performance. Our non-U.S. revenues and operations expose us to numerous risks that may negatively impact our business.To the extent we generate revenues outside of the United States, non-U.S. revenues and non-U.S. manufacturing bases exposes us to a number of risks, including:•Significant competition could come from local or long-term participants in non-U.S. markets who may have significantly greater market knowledge and substantially greater resources than we do;•Local customers may have a preference for locally-produced products;•Credit risk or financial condition of local customers and distributors could affect our ability to market our products or collect receivables;•Regulatory or political systems or barriers may make it difficult or impossible to enter or remain in new markets. In addition, these barriers may impact our existing businesses, including making it more difficult for them to grow;•Local political, economic and social conditions, including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions, political instability, nationalization of private enterprises, or unexpected changes relating to currency could adversely impact our revenues and operations;•The United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) has contributed to, and may continue to contribute to, economic, currency, market and regulatory uncertainty in the United Kingdom and European Union and could adversely affect economic, currency, market, regulatory, or political conditions both in those regions and worldwide;•Customs, tariffs and trade restrictions may make it difficult or impossible for us to move our products or assets across borders in a cost-effective manner;•Transportation and shipping expenses add cost to our products;•Complications related to shipping, including delays due to weather, labor action, or customs, may impact our profit margins or lead to lost business;•Local, regional or worldwide hostilities, including armed conflicts, could impact our operations;•Distance and language and cultural differences may make it more difficult to manage our business and employees and to effectively market our products and services; and•Public health crises, including the outbreak of a pandemic or contagious disease.Any of the above factors or other factors affecting social and economic activity in the United Kingdom, China, and South Africa or affecting the movement of people and products into and from these countries to our major markets, could have a significant negative effect on our operations.Climate change and legal or regulatory responses thereto may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.There is growing concern that increases in global average temperatures as a result of increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause significant adverse long-term climate changes, as well as more near-term changes in weather patterns that could adversely impact our operations. Moreover, growing concern over climate change may result in additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment. Many of our manufacturing plants and the products we manufacture, particularly in the HVAC reportable segment, use significant amounts of electricity generated by burning fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide. Additionally, many of the products we manufacture in the HVAC reportable segment use natural gas or oil as a fuel source and may be subject to increasing regulatory restrictions aimed at “de-carbonization” or the elimination of such fuel sources.  Increased energy or compliance costs and expenses as a result of increased legal or regulatory requirements may cause disruptions in, or an increase in the costs associated with, the manufacturing and distribution of our products and we may be required to develop product improvements to satisfy developing energy-efficiency targets in order to remain competitive. In addition, the impacts of climate change and legal or regulatory initiatives to address climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. If we fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress on environmental and sustainability programs and initiatives or fail to develop product improvements to satisfy developing energy-efficiency targets, the results could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.12Risks Related to Acquisitions and DispositionsAcquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges.Our acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:•Adverse effects on our reported operating results due to charges to earnings, including potential impairment charges associated with goodwill and other intangibles;•Diversion of management attention from core business operations;•Integration of technology, operations, personnel and financial and other systems;•Increased expenses;•Increased foreign operations, often with unique issues relating to corporate culture, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and other challenges;•Assumption of known and unknown liabilities and exposure to litigation;•Increased levels of debt or dilution to existing stockholders;•Potential disputes with the sellers of acquired businesses; and•Potential cybersecurity risks, as acquired systems may not possess the appropriate security measures.We conduct operational, financial, tax, systems, and legal due diligence on all acquisitions; however, we cannot assure that all potential risks or liabilities are adequately discovered, disclosed, or understood in each instance.In addition, internal controls over financial reporting of acquired companies may not be compliant with required standards. Issues may exist that could rise to the level of significant deficiencies or, in some cases, material weaknesses, particularly with respect to foreign companies or non-public U.S. companies.Our integration activities may place substantial demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. Customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business, technology, service or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.Our failure to successfully complete acquisitions could negatively affect us.We may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions, which could materially impact our growth rate, results of operations, future cash flows and stock price. Our ability to achieve our goals depends upon, among other things, our ability to identify and successfully acquire companies, businesses and product lines, to effectively integrate them and to achieve cost savings. We may also be unable to raise additional funds necessary to consummate these acquisitions. In addition, decreases in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to consummate acquisitions. Competition for acquisitions in our business areas may be significant and result in higher prices for businesses, including businesses that we may target, which may also affect our acquisition rate or benefits achieved from our acquisitions.We may not achieve the expected cost savings and other benefits of our acquisitions.We strive for and expect to achieve cost savings in connection with our acquisitions, including: (i) manufacturing process and supply chain rationalization, (ii) streamlining redundant administrative overhead and support activities, (iii) restructuring and repositioning sales and marketing organizations to eliminate redundancies, and (iv) achieving anticipated revenue synergies. Cost savings expectations are estimates that are inherently difficult to predict and are necessarily speculative in nature, and we cannot assure you that we will achieve expected, or any, cost savings in connection with an acquisition. In addition, we cannot assure you that unforeseen factors will not offset the estimated cost savings or other benefits from our acquisitions. As a result, anticipated benefits could be delayed, differ significantly from our estimates and the other information contained in this report, or not be realized.Dispositions or liabilities retained in connection with dispositions could negatively affect us.Our dispositions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from running our core businesses, increased expense associated with the dispositions, potential disputes with the customers or suppliers of the disposed businesses, potential disputes with the acquirers of the disposed businesses and a potential dilutive effect on our earnings per share. In addition, we have agreed to retain certain liabilities in connection with the disposition of certain businesses. These liabilities may be significant and could negatively impact our business.If dispositions are not completed in a timely manner, there may be a negative effect on our cash flows and/or our ability to execute our strategy. In addition, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of our dispositions. See “Business,” 13“MD&A - Results of Discontinued Operations,” and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for the status of our divestitures.Risks Related to Human Capital ResourcesThe loss of key personnel and an inability to attract and retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations.We are dependent on the continued services of our leadership team. The loss of these personnel without adequate replacement could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience in many locations in order to operate our business successfully. From time to time, there may be a shortage of qualified managers or skilled labor, which may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain qualified employees. If we were unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals or our costs to do so were to increase significantly, our operations could be materially adversely affected.We are subject to work stoppages, union negotiations, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force, which may adversely impact our operations and cause us to incur incremental costs.At December 31, 2021, we had six domestic collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 300 of our over 3,100 employees. Three of these collective bargaining agreements expire in 2022 and are scheduled for negotiation and renewal. We also have various collective labor arrangements covering certain non-U.S. employee groups. We are subject to potential union campaigns, work stoppages, union negotiations and other potential labor disputes. Further, we may be subject to work stoppages, which are beyond our control, at our suppliers or customers.Risks Related to Financial MattersWe may not be able to finance future needs or adapt our business plan to react to changes in economic or business conditions because of restrictions placed on us by our senior credit facilities and any existing or future instruments governing our other indebtedness.Our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain, or future or revised instruments may contain, various restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied. We also must comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests. Our subsidiaries may also be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us. In addition, our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain or may contain additional affirmative and negative covenants. Material existing restrictions are described more fully in the “MD&A - Liquidity and Financial Condition - Senior Credit Facilities” and Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. Each of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities, such as acquisitions.If we do not comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness, we could default under those agreements, and the debt, together with accrued interest, could be declared due and payable. If we default under our senior credit facilities, the lenders could cause all our outstanding debt obligations under our senior credit facilities to become due and payable or require us to repay the indebtedness under these facilities. If our debt is accelerated, we may not be able to repay or refinance our debt. In addition, any default under our senior credit facilities or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. If the indebtedness under our senior credit facilities is accelerated, we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due under our senior credit facilities or other debt securities then outstanding. Our ability to comply with these provisions of our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness will be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control. Complying with our covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to us and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete, including against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.Currency conversion risk could have a material impact on our reported results of business operations. Our operating results are presented in U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in which we conduct business could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into U.S. dollars.Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, including countries utilizing the Euro, which may have a material adverse effect on sales or require us to lower our 14prices, and also decrease our reported revenues or margins related to sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent we are unable or determine not to increase local currency prices. Likewise, the increased strength of the U.S. dollar could allow competitors with foreign-based manufacturing costs to sell their products in the U.S. at lower prices. Alternatively, decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased overseas.Similarly, increased or decreased strength of the currencies of non-U.S. countries in which we manufacture will have a comparable effect against the currencies of other jurisdictions in which we sell. For example, our Radiodetection business manufactures a number of detection instruments in the United Kingdom and sells to customers in other countries, therefore increased strength of the British pound sterling will increase the effective price of these products sold in British pound sterling into other countries; and decreased strength of British pound sterling could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased outside of the United Kingdom.Credit and counterparty risks could harm our business.The financial condition of our customers and distributors could affect our ability to market our products or collect receivables. In addition, financial difficulties faced by our customers may lead to cancellations or delays of orders.Our customers may suffer financial difficulties that make them unable to pay for a project when completed, or they may decide not or be unable to pay us, either as a matter of corporate decision-making or in response to changes in local laws and regulations. We cannot assure you that expenses or losses for uncollectible amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows.Changes in tax laws and regulations or other factors could cause our income tax obligations to increase, potentially reducing our net income and adversely affecting our cash flows.We are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions around the world. In preparing our financial statements, we provide for income taxes based on current tax laws and regulations and the estimated taxable income within each of these jurisdictions. Our income tax obligations, however, may be higher due to numerous factors, including changes in tax laws or regulations and the outcome of audits and examinations of our tax returns.Officials in some of the jurisdictions in which we do business have proposed, or announced that they are reviewing, tax changes that could potentially increase taxes, and other revenue-raising laws and regulations, including those that may be enacted as a result of various OECD projects. Changes in applicable U.S. or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.As indicated in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements, certain of our income tax returns are currently under audit. In connection with these and any future audits, there is a risk that we could be challenged by tax authorities on certain of the tax positions we have taken, or will take, on our tax returns. Although we believe that current tax laws and regulations support our positions, there can be no assurance that tax authorities will agree with our positions. In the event tax authorities were to challenge one or more of our tax positions, an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. If the fair value of any of our reporting units is insufficient to recover the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangibles of the respective reporting unit, a material non-cash charge to earnings could result.At December 31, 2021, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net, of $872.8. We conduct annual impairment testing to determine if we will be able to recover all or a portion of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. In addition, we review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment more frequently if impairment indicators arise. If the fair value is insufficient to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, we may be required to record a material non-cash charge to earnings.The fair values of our reporting units generally are based on discounted cash flow projections that are believed to be reasonable under current and forecasted circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of the reported net assets of our reporting units. Other considerations are also incorporated, including comparable price multiples. Many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets that they serve. Accordingly, we consider estimates and judgments that affect the future cash flow projections, including principal methods of competition such as volume, price, service, product performance and technical innovations and estimates associated with cost reduction initiatives, capacity utilization, and assumptions for inflation and foreign currency changes. We monitor impairment indicators across all of our businesses. Significant changes in market conditions and estimates or judgments used to determine expected 15future cash flows that indicate a reduction in carrying value may give, and have given, rise to impairments in the period that the change becomes known.Cost reduction actions may affect our business.Cost reduction actions often result in charges against earnings. These charges can vary significantly from period to period and, as a result, we may experience fluctuations in our reported net income and earnings per share due to the timing of cost reduction actions.Changes in key estimates and assumptions related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, such as discount rates, assumed long-term return on assets, assumed long-term trends of future cost, and accounting and legislative changes, as well as actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and other actuarial factors, could affect our results of operations and cash flows.We have defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, including both qualified and non-qualified plans, which cover a portion of our salaried and hourly employees and retirees, including a portion of our employees and retirees in foreign countries. As of December 31, 2021, our net liability to these plans was $115.5. The determination of funding requirements and pension expense or income associated with these plans involves significant judgment, particularly with respect to discount rates, long-term trends of future costs and other actuarial assumptions. If our assumptions change significantly due to changes in economic, legislative and/or demographic experience or circumstances, our pension and other benefit plans’ expense, funded status and our required cash contributions to such plans could be negatively impacted. In addition, returns on plan assets could have a material impact on our pension plans’ expense, funded status and our required contributions to the plans. Changes in regulations or law could also significantly impact our obligations. For example, see “MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates” for the impact that changes in certain assumptions used in the calculation of our costs and obligations associated with these plans could have on our results of operations and financial position.Our incurrence of additional indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.At December 31, 2021, we had $246.0 in total indebtedness. On that same date, we had $437.8 of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities, after giving effect to $12.2 reserved for outstanding letters of credit. In addition, at December 31, 2021, we had $30.3 of available issuance capacity under our foreign credit instrument facilities after giving effect to $24.7 reserved for outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2021, our cash and equivalents balance was $396.0. See “MD&A - Liquidity and Financial Condition - Borrowings” and Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance, or assumed in connection with, acquisitions. We may renegotiate or refinance our senior credit facilities or other debt facilities, or enter into additional agreements that have different or more stringent terms. Increases in the level of our indebtedness relative to our cash balances could:•Impact our ability to obtain new, or refinance existing, indebtedness, on favorable terms or at all;•Limit our ability to obtain, or obtain on favorable terms, additional debt financing for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions;•Limit our flexibility in reacting to competitive and other changes in the industry and economic conditions;•Limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock in the future;•Coupled with a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows due to economic developments or adverse developments in our business, make it difficult to meet debt service requirements; and•Expose us to interest rate fluctuations to the extent existing borrowings are, and any new borrowings may be, at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expense and interest payments in the event of increases in interest rates.Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal or pay interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors beyond our control. In addition, we cannot assure you that future borrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, whether in the ordinary course of business or upon an acceleration of such indebtedness, we may pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, revising implementation of or delaying strategic plans or seeking additional equity capital. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. In addition, we cannot assure that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements, or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements.Numerous banks in many countries are syndicate members in our credit facility. Failure of one or more of our larger lenders, or several of our smaller lenders, could significantly reduce availability of our credit, which could harm our liquidity.16Failure of our internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our business and financial results.Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud.  Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud.  The identification of a material weakness could indicate a lack of controls adequate to generate accurate financial statements that, in turn, could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to timely remediate any material weaknesses that may be identified in future periods or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If this material weakness is not remediated, our failure to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and a failure to meet our reporting and financial obligations, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock.Management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the available insurance coverage for liabilities associated with alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.As discussed in Item 9A. “Controls and Procedures” of this filing, management has evaluated its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that they were not effective as of December 31, 2021.We are committed to remediating the material weakness as promptly as possible, and management is in the process of implementing the remediation plan; however, there can be no assurance as to when the material weaknesses will be remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to record, process and report financial information timely and accurately could be adversely affected.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockProvisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company, and accordingly, we may not consummate a transaction that our stockholders consider favorable.Provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws may inhibit changes in control of our company not approved by our Board. These provisions include, for example: a staggered board of directors; a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent; a requirement that special stockholder meetings be called only by our Chairman, President or Board; advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations; limitations on stockholders’ ability to amend, alter or repeal the By-laws; enhanced voting requirements for certain business combinations involving substantial stockholders; the authority of our Board to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with terms determined in its discretion; and limitations on stockholders’ ability to remove directors. In addition, we are afforded the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could have similar effects. In general, Section 203 prohibits us from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” (each as defined in Section 203) for at least three years after the time the person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met. These protective provisions could result in our not consummating a transaction that our stockholders consider favorable or discourage entities from attempting to acquire us, potentially at a significant premium to our then-existing stock price.Increases in the number of shares of our outstanding common stock could adversely affect our common stock price or dilute our earnings per share.Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock into the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. As of December 31, 2021, we had the ability to issue up to an additional 4.074 shares as restricted stock shares, restricted stock units, performance stock units, or stock options under our 2019 Stock Compensation Plan, and 0.027 under our 2006 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Incentive Plan. We also may issue a significant number of additional shares, in connection with acquisitions, through a registration statement, or otherwise. Additional shares issued would have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share.17"
8,SPXC,SPX CORP,2021-02-26,"ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
(All currency and share amounts are in millions)You should consider the risks described below and elsewhere in our documents filed with the SEC before investing in any of our securities. We may amend, supplement or add to the risk factors described below from time to time in future reports filed with the SEC.Risks Related to the COVID-19 PandemicThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our business.During March 2020, our business began to experience the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including a modest impact on our consolidated financial results for year ended December 31, 2020. In response, we have taken a number steps to protect our employees, customers, and business, including:•The implementation of a COVID-19 task force, which, among other things, is monitoring the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on a regular basis;•The adoption of practices that promote social distancing and prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., visitor access restrictions at our facilities, the use of masks and, in most cases, temperature checks at our facilities, remote work arrangements where feasible, staggered work shifts, travel restrictions, etc.);•Enhanced workplace hygiene and sanitary processes at our facilities; and•Modified/enhanced employee benefits to better support employee needs in the current environment.The COVID-19 pandemic could continue to have an adverse impact on our business and consolidated financial results during 2021 and we are unable to determine the extent, duration, or nature at this time. The intensity, duration and governmental response to the pandemic, as well as the pace of vaccination efforts, are all highly uncertain and could contribute to the ultimate impact on our business. Specifically, the COVID-19 pandemic could impact:•Our customers’ ability to access credit and to pay amounts due to us;•Our distributors’ ability to perform;•Our suppliers’ ability to perform and the availability of materials and subcontractors’ services; and•Our ability to:◦Access credit;◦Meet contractual deadlines with customers, which could result in delays in payments from customers and customers possibly seeking delay damages;◦Complete acquisitions due to potential adverse impacts on targeted businesses or product lines; and◦Meet the financial covenants under our senior credit and other debt agreements.The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could also result in:•A prolonged reduction in the demand for certain of our products;•A prolonged shut-down of one or more of our facilities either due to exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic or to further restrictive government orders;•Disruptions in our supply chain or increased costs for certain components or commodities;•Asset impairment charges;•A loss of productivity, greater cybersecurity risk and other fraud risks, and difficulties in maintaining internal controls over financial reporting due to the impact of employees working remotely;•An adverse impact to the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans, which could result in (i) a material charge during the fourth quarter of 2021 and (ii) on a longer-term, additional funding requirements for the plans;•The diversion of management’s attention from core business operations; and•Restructuring charges if we decide to reduce headcount as a result of a decline in customer demand.Any of the above risks could have a material adverse impact on our business and consolidated financial results.6Risks Related to Contingent LiabilitiesWe are subject to various claims, disputes, enforcement actions, litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings related to two large power projects in South Africa that could ultimately be resolved against us.Since 2008, DBT has been executing contracts on two large power projects in South Africa (Kusile and Medupi). Over such time, the business environment surrounding these projects has been difficult, as DBT, along with many other contractors on the projects, have experienced delays, cost over-runs, and various other challenges associated with a complex set of contractual relationships among the end customer, prime contractors, various subcontractors (including DBT and its subcontractors), and various suppliers. DBT is currently involved in a number of claims relating to these challenges and may be subject to other claims, which could be significant. We cannot give assurance that these claims and the costs to assert our claims and defend claims against us will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See “MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates - Contingent Liabilities” and Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. We are subject to potential liability relating to claims, complaints and proceedings, including those relating to asbestos, environmental, product liability and other matters.We are subject to various laws, ordinances, regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the United States and other nations. Additionally, changes in laws, ordinances, regulations, or other governmental policies may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities.Numerous claims, complaints, and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business have been asserted or are pending against us or certain of our subsidiaries (collectively, “claims”). These claims relate to litigation matters (e.g., class actions and contracts, intellectual property, and competitive claims), environmental matters, product liability matters (predominately associated with alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials), and other risk management matters (e.g., general liability, automobile, and workers’ compensation claims). Periodically, claims, complaints and proceedings arising other than in the ordinary course of business have been asserted or are pending against us or certain of our subsidiaries (e.g. patent infringement), including claims with respect to businesses that we have acquired for matters arising before the relevant date of the acquisition. From time to time, we face actions by governmental authorities, both in and outside the United States. Additionally, we may become subject to other claims of which we are currently unaware, which may be significant, or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring significantly greater loss than we anticipate. Our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable (e.g., because of insurer insolvency) to protect us against potential loss exposures.The liabilities we record for asbestos product liability matters are based on a number of assumptions, including historical claims and payment experience and actuarial estimates of the future period during which additional claims are reasonably foreseeable.  While we base our assumptions on facts currently known to us, they entail inherently subjective judgments and uncertainties.  As a result, our current assumptions for estimating these liabilities may not prove accurate, and we may be required to adjust these liabilities in the future, including as a result of our change in relevant assumptions, which could result in material charges to earnings.  In addition, a significant increase in claims, costs, and/or issues with existing insurance coverage could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We face environmental exposures including, for example, those relating to discharges from and materials handled as part of our operations, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by petroleum products or hazardous substances or wastes, and the health and safety of our employees. We may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal, or remediation of hazardous substances or petroleum products on, under, or in our current or formerly owned or leased properties, or from third-party disposal facilities that we may have used, without regard to whether we knew of, or caused, the presence of the contaminants. The presence of, or failure to properly remediate, these substances may have adverse effects, including, for example, substantial investigative or remedial obligations and limitations on the ability to sell or rent affected property or to borrow funds using affected property as collateral. New or existing environmental matters or changes in environmental laws or policies could lead to material costs for environmental compliance or cleanup. In addition, environmentally related product regulations are growing globally in number and complexity and could contribute to increased costs with respect to disclosure requirements, product sales and distribution related costs, and post-sale recycling and disposal costs. There can be no assurance that these liabilities and costs will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.We devote significant time and expense to defend against the various claims, complaints, and proceedings brought against us. In addition, from time to time, we bring actions to enforce our rights against customers, suppliers, insurers, and other third 7parties. We cannot assure you that the expenses or distractions from operating our businesses arising from these defenses and actions will not increase materially.We cannot assure you that our accruals and right to indemnity and insurance will be sufficient, that recoveries from insurance or indemnification claims will be available or that any of our current or future claims or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.See “MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates - Contingent Liabilities” and Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Risks Related to our Markets and CustomersMany of the markets in which we operate are cyclical or are subject to industry events, and our results have been and could be affected as a result.Many of the markets in which we operate are subject to general economic cycles or industry events. In addition, certain of our businesses are subject to market-specific cycles.Furthermore, contract timing on projects, including those relating to power transmission and distribution systems, communication technologies, fare collection systems, and process cooling systems and towers may cause significant fluctuations in revenues and profits from period to period.The businesses of many of our customers are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced, and may continue to experience, periodic downturns. Cyclical changes and specific industry events could also affect sales of products in our other businesses. Downturns in the business cycles of our different operations may occur at the same time, which could exacerbate any adverse effects on our business. In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal and weather-related fluctuations. Historically, many of our key businesses generally have tended to have stronger performance in the second half of the year. See “MD&A - Results of Continuing Operations and Results of Reportable Segments and Other Operating Segment.”Our business depends on capital investment and maintenance expenditures by our customers.Demand for most of our products and services depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by our customers. The level of capital expenditures by our customers fluctuates based on planned expansions, new builds and repairs, commodity prices, general economic conditions, availability of credit, and expectations of future market behavior. Any of these factors, whether individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, in turn, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our customers have been and could be impacted by commodity availability and prices. A number of factors outside our control, including fluctuating commodity prices, impact the demand for our products. Increased commodity prices, including as a result of new or increased tariffs or the impact of new trade laws, may increase our customers’ cost of doing business, thus causing them to delay or cancel large capital projects.On the other hand, declining commodity prices may cause our customers to delay or cancel projects relating to the production of such commodities. Reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity, which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. Reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in the relevant market.We operate in highly competitive markets. Our failure to compete effectively could harm our business. We sell our products in highly competitive markets, which could result in pressure on our profit margins and limit our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products. We compete on a number of fronts, including on the basis of service, product performance, technical innovation and price. We have a number of competitors with substantial technological and financial resources, brand recognition and established relationships with global service providers. Some of our competitors have lower cost structures, support from local governments, or both. In addition, new competitors may enter the markets in which we participate. Competitors may be able to offer lower prices, additional products or services or a more attractive mix of products or services, or services or other incentives that we cannot or will not match. These competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new or emerging technologies and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns and make more attractive offers to potential customers, employees and strategic partners. In addition, competitive environments in slow-growth markets, to which some of our businesses have exposure, have been inherently more influenced by pricing and domestic and global economic conditions. To remain competitive, we need to invest in manufacturing, 8marketing, customer service and support, and our distribution networks. No assurances can be made that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make the investment required to maintain or increase our market share or that our investments will be successful. If we do not compete successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.Risks Related to our Suppliers and VendorsThe price and availability of raw materials and components has and may adversely affect our business. We are exposed to a variety of risks relating to the price and availability of raw materials and components. In recent years, we have faced volatility in the prices of many key raw materials (e.g., copper, steel and oil) and key components (e.g. circuit boards), including price increases in response to trade laws and tariffs. Increases in the prices of raw materials and components, including as a result of new or increased tariffs or the impact of new trade laws, or shortages or allocations of materials and components may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as there may be delays in our ability, or we may not be able, to pass cost increases on to our customers, or our sales may be reduced. We are subject to, or may enter into, long-term supplier contracts that may increase our exposure to pricing fluctuations.The fact that we outsource various elements of the products and services we sell subjects us to the business risks of our suppliers and subcontractors, which could have a material adverse impact on our operations.In areas where we depend on third-party suppliers and subcontractors for outsourced products, components or services, we are subject to the risk of customer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of the products or services we sell due to supplier or subcontractor failure. In addition, business difficulties experienced by a third-party supplier or subcontractor can lead to the interruption of our ability to obtain outsourced products or services and ultimately our inability to supply products or services to our customers. Third-party supplier and subcontractor business interruptions can include, but are not limited to, work stoppages, union negotiations and other labor disputes. Current economic conditions could also impact the ability of suppliers and subcontractors to access credit and, thus, impair their ability to provide us quality products or services in a timely manner, or at all.Risks Related to Information, Technology and CybersecurityIf we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted. We are increasingly dependent on cloud-based and other information technology (“IT”) networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information. We depend on such IT infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and between our personnel and suppliers and customers. In addition, we rely on these IT systems to record, process, summarize, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including, among other things, our accounting and financial reporting processes; our manufacturing and supply chain processes; our sales and marketing efforts; and the data related to our research and development efforts. The failure of our IT systems or those of our business partners or third-party service providers to perform properly, or difficulties encountered in the development of new systems or the upgrade of existing systems, could disrupt our business and harm our reputation, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess or obsolete inventory, and product shortages, causing our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results to suffer. Upon expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third-party vendors, we may not be able to replace the services provided to us in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable to us, and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete.IT security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication and we have detected numerous attempts to compromise the security of our IT systems. Cyber-attacks may be random, coordinated, or targeted, including sophisticated computer crime threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, and those of our business partners and third-party service providers, and to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. Despite our implementation of security measures, cybersecurity threats, such as malicious software, phishing attacks, computer viruses, and attempts to gain unauthorized access, cannot be completely mitigated. Our business, reputation, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if, as a result of a significant cyber event or otherwise, our operations are disrupted or shutdown; our confidential, proprietary information is stolen or disclosed; the performance or security of our cloud-based product offerings is impacted; our intranet and internet sites are compromised; data is manipulated or destroyed; we incur costs or are required to pay fines in connection with stolen customer, employee, or other confidential information; we must dedicate 9significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection; or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs.In addition, newer generations of certain of our products include IT systems, including systems that are cloud-based and/or interconnect through the internet. These systems are subject to the same cybersecurity threats described above and the failure of these systems, including by cyber-attack, could disrupt our customers’ business, leading to potential exposure for us.Our technology is important to our success, and failure to develop new products or make the appropriate investment in technology advancements may result in the loss of any sustainable competitive advantage in products, services and processes.We believe the development of our intellectual property rights is critical to the success of our business. In order to maintain our market positions and margins, we need to regularly develop and introduce high-quality, technologically advanced and cost-effective products on a timely basis, in many cases in multiple jurisdictions around the world. Information technology systems, platforms and products are critical to our operating environment, product offerings and competitive position. Certain digitalization initiatives important to our long-term success may require capital investment, have significant risks associated with their execution, and could take several years to implement. If we do not accurately predict, prepare and respond to new technology innovations, market developments and changing customer needs, our revenues, profitability and long-term competitiveness could be materially adversely affected.Failure to protect or unauthorized use of our intellectual property may harm our business.Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology or knowledge, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as in the United States. Costs incurred to defend our rights may be material.Risks Related to Our Manufacturing and OperationsCost overruns, inflation, delays and other risks could significantly impact our results, particularly with respect to fixed-price contracts.A portion of our revenues and earnings is generated through fixed-price contracts, particularly within our Engineered Solutions reportable segment. We recognize revenues for certain of these contracts over-time whereby revenues and expenses, and thereby profit, in a given period are determined based on our estimates as to the project status and the costs remaining to complete a particular project.Estimates of total revenues and cost at completion are subject to many variables, including the length of time to complete a contract. In addition, contract delays may negatively impact these estimates and our revenues and earnings results for affected periods.To the extent that we underestimate the remaining cost to complete a project, we may overstate the revenues and profit in a particular period. Further, certain of these contracts provide for penalties or liquidated damages for failure to timely perform our obligations under the contract, or require that we, at our expense, correct and remedy certain defects to the satisfaction of the other party. Because some of our contracts are at a fixed price, we face the risk that cost overruns or inflation may exceed, erode or eliminate our expected profit margin, or cause us to record a loss on our projects.Our current and planned products may contain defects or errors that are detected only after delivery to customers. If that occurs, our reputation may be harmed and we may face additional costs.We cannot assure you that our product development, manufacturing and integration testing will be adequate to detect all defects, errors, failures and quality issues that could impact customer satisfaction or result in claims against us with regard to our products. As a result, we may have, and from time to time have had, to replace certain components and/or provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects in products that are shipped. The occurrence of any defects, errors, failures or quality issues could result in cancellation of orders, product returns, diversion of our resources, legal actions by our customers or our customers’ end users and other losses to us or to any of our customers or end users, and could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and loss of sales, which would harm our business and adversely affect our revenues, profitability and cash flows.10Risks Related to Macro-Economic, Domestic and World Political EventsGovernmental laws and regulations could negatively affect our business.Changes in laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject could have a significant negative impact on our business. In addition, we could face material costs and risks if it is determined that we have failed to comply with relevant laws and regulations. We are subject to U.S. Customs and Export Regulations, including U.S. International Traffic and Arms Regulations and similar laws, which collectively control import, export and sale of technologies by companies and various other aspects of the operation of our business; the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws, which prohibit companies from making improper payments to government officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business; the California Transparency in Supply Chain Act and similar laws and regulations, which relate to human trafficking and anti-slavery and impose new compliance requirements on our businesses and their suppliers; and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and the European General Data Protection Regulation, which establish data management requirements for the protection of personal information of individuals. While our policies and procedures mandate compliance with such laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees and agents will always act in strict compliance. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations may result in civil and criminal enforcement, including monetary fines and possible injunctions against shipment of product or other of our activities, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Several of our businesses are reliant on or may be directly impacted by government regulations. Changes to these regulations may have a significant negative impact on these businesses. For example, (i) a reduction of Federal Aviation Administration regulations mandating lighting of towers and buildings at height; (ii) increases in Department of Energy regulations on energy efficiency requirements for heating, and (iii) a reduction in regulations requiring 811 calls to be made before the commencement of a digging project, could have a significant negative impact on these businesses. While we monitor these regulations and our businesses plan for potential changes, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt in each circumstance. Failure to adapt if regulations change could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Difficulties presented by domestic economic, political, legal, accounting and business factors could negatively affect our business.In 2020, approximately 87% of our revenues were generated inside the United States. Our reliance on U.S. revenues and U.S. manufacturing bases exposes us to a number of risks, including:•Government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions such as antidumping duties, as well as the imposition of trade sanctions by the United States against a class of products imported from or sold and exported to, or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with, countries in which we conduct business, could significantly increase our cost of products imported into or exported from the United States or reduce our sales and harm our business and the relaxation of embargoes and foreign trade restrictions, including antidumping duties on transformers, by the United States could adversely affect the market for our products in the United States;•Customs and tariffs may make it difficult or impossible for us to move our products or assets across borders in a cost-effective manner and may increase the cost of our raw materials, including raw materials sourced domestically;•Transportation and shipping expenses add cost to our products;•Complications related to shipping, including delays due to weather, labor action, or customs, may impact our profit margins or lead to lost business;•Environmental and other laws and regulations could increase our costs or limit our ability to run our business; and•Our ability to obtain supplies from foreign vendors and ship products internationally may be impaired during times of crisis or otherwise.Any of the above factors or other factors affecting the movement of people and products into and from various countries to North America could have a significant negative effect on our operations. In addition, our concentration on U.S. business may make it difficult to enter new markets, making it more difficult for our businesses to grow.Worldwide economic conditions could negatively impact our businesses.Many of our customers historically have tended to delay capital projects, including expensive maintenance and upgrades, during economic downturns. Poor macroeconomic conditions could negatively impact our businesses by adversely affecting, among other things, our: •Revenues;•Margins;•Profits;11•Cash flows;•Customers’ orders, including order cancellation activity or delays on existing orders;•Customers’ ability to access credit;•Customers’ ability to pay amounts due to us; and•Suppliers’ and distributors’ ability to perform and the availability and costs of materials and subcontracted services.Downturns in global economies could negatively impact our performance or any expectations in reporting performance. Our non-U.S. revenues and operations expose us to numerous risks that may negatively impact our business.To the extent we generate revenues outside of the United States, non-U.S. revenues and non-U.S. manufacturing bases exposes us to a number of risks, including:•Significant competition could come from local or long-term participants in non-U.S. markets who may have significantly greater market knowledge and substantially greater resources than we do;•Local customers may have a preference for locally-produced products;•Credit risk or financial condition of local customers and distributors could affect our ability to market our products or collect receivables;•Regulatory or political systems or barriers may make it difficult or impossible to enter or remain in new markets. In addition, these barriers may impact our existing businesses, including making it more difficult for them to grow;•Local political, economic and social conditions, including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions, political instability, nationalization of private enterprises, or unexpected changes relating to currency could adversely impact our revenues and operations;•The United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) has contributed to, and may continue to contribute to, economic, currency, market and regulatory uncertainty in the United Kingdom and European Union and could adversely affect economic, currency, market, regulatory, or political conditions both in those regions and worldwide;•Customs, tariffs and trade restrictions may make it difficult or impossible for us to move our products or assets across borders in a cost-effective manner;•Transportation and shipping expenses add cost to our products;•Complications related to shipping, including delays due to weather, labor action, or customs, may impact our profit margins or lead to lost business;•Local, regional or worldwide hostilities could impact our operations;•Distance and language and cultural differences may make it more difficult to manage our business and employees and to effectively market our products and services; and•Public health crises, including the outbreak of a pandemic or contagious disease.Any of the above factors or other factors affecting social and economic activity in the United Kingdom, China, and South Africa or affecting the movement of people and products into and from these countries to our major markets, could have a significant negative effect on our operations.Risks Related to Acquisitions and DispositionsAcquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges.Our acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:•Adverse effects on our reported operating results due to charges to earnings, including potential impairment charges associated with goodwill and other intangibles;•Diversion of management attention from core business operations;•Integration of technology, operations, personnel and financial and other systems;•Increased expenses;•Increased foreign operations, often with unique issues relating to corporate culture, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and other challenges;•Assumption of known and unknown liabilities and exposure to litigation;•Increased levels of debt or dilution to existing stockholders;•Potential disputes with the sellers of acquired businesses; and•Potential cybersecurity risks, as acquired systems may not possess the appropriate security measures.12We conduct operational, financial, tax, systems, and legal due diligence on all acquisitions; however, we cannot assure that all potential risks or liabilities are adequately discovered, disclosed, or understood in each instance.In addition, internal controls over financial reporting of acquired companies may not be compliant with required standards. Issues may exist that could rise to the level of significant deficiencies or, in some cases, material weaknesses, particularly with respect to foreign companies or non-public U.S. companies.Our integration activities may place substantial demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. Customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business, technology, service or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.Our failure to successfully complete acquisitions could negatively affect us.We may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions, which could materially impact our growth rate, results of operations, future cash flows and stock price. Our ability to achieve our goals depends upon, among other things, our ability to identify and successfully acquire companies, businesses and product lines, to effectively integrate them and to achieve cost savings. We may also be unable to raise additional funds necessary to consummate these acquisitions. In addition, decreases in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to consummate acquisitions. Competition for acquisitions in our business areas may be significant and result in higher prices for businesses, including businesses that we may target, which may also affect our acquisition rate or benefits achieved from our acquisitions.We may not achieve the expected cost savings and other benefits of our acquisitions.We strive for and expect to achieve cost savings in connection with our acquisitions, including: (i) manufacturing process and supply chain rationalization, (ii) streamlining redundant administrative overhead and support activities, (iii) restructuring and repositioning sales and marketing organizations to eliminate redundancies, and (iv) achieving anticipated revenue synergies. Cost savings expectations are estimates that are inherently difficult to predict and are necessarily speculative in nature, and we cannot assure you that we will achieve expected, or any, cost savings in connection with an acquisition. In addition, we cannot assure you that unforeseen factors will not offset the estimated cost savings or other benefits from our acquisitions. As a result, anticipated benefits could be delayed, differ significantly from our estimates and the other information contained in this report, or not be realized.Dispositions or liabilities retained in connection with dispositions could negatively affect us.Our dispositions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from running our core businesses, increased expense associated with the dispositions, potential disputes with the customers or suppliers of the disposed businesses, potential disputes with the acquirers of the disposed businesses and a potential dilutive effect on our earnings per share. In addition, we have agreed to retain certain liabilities in connection with the disposition of certain businesses, including the Balcke Dürr business. These liabilities may be significant and could negatively impact our business.If dispositions are not completed in a timely manner, there may be a negative effect on our cash flows and/or our ability to execute our strategy. In addition, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of our dispositions. See “Business,” “MD&A - Results of Discontinued Operations,” and Notes 4 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements for the status of our divestitures, including liabilities retained in connection with such dispositions.Risks Related to Human Capital ResourcesThe loss of key personnel and an inability to attract and retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations.We are dependent on the continued services of our leadership team. The loss of these personnel without adequate replacement could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience in many locations in order to operate our business successfully. From time to time, there may be a shortage of qualified managers or skilled labor, which may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain qualified employees. If we were unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals or our costs to do so were to increase significantly, our operations could be materially adversely affected.13We are subject to work stoppages, union negotiations, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force, which may adversely impact our operations and cause us to incur incremental costs.At December 31, 2020, we had eight domestic collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 1,100 of our over 4,500 employees. Three of these collective bargaining agreements expire in 2021 and are scheduled for negotiation and renewal. We also have various collective labor arrangements covering certain non-U.S. employee groups. We are subject to potential union campaigns, work stoppages, union negotiations and other potential labor disputes. Further, we may be subject to work stoppages, which are beyond our control, at our suppliers or customers.Risks Related to Financial MattersOur indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.At December 31, 2020, we had $412.4 in total indebtedness. On that same date, we had $302.9 of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities, after giving effect to $17.3 reserved for outstanding letters of credit and $129.8 of borrowings under the revolving credit agreement, and $11.5 of available borrowing capacity under our trade receivables financing arrangement. In addition, at December 31, 2020, we had $11.0 of available issuance capacity under our foreign credit instrument facilities after giving effect to $89.0 reserved for outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2020, our cash and equivalents balance was $68.3. See MD&A and Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance, or assumed in connection with, acquisitions. We may renegotiate or refinance our senior credit facilities or other debt facilities, or enter into additional agreements that have different or more stringent terms. The level of our indebtedness could:•Impact our ability to obtain new, or refinance existing, indebtedness, on favorable terms or at all;•Limit our ability to obtain, or obtain on favorable terms, additional debt financing for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions;•Limit our flexibility in reacting to competitive and other changes in the industry and economic conditions;•Limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock in the future;•Coupled with a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows due to economic developments or adverse developments in our business, make it difficult to meet debt service requirements; and•Expose us to interest rate fluctuations to the extent existing borrowings are, and any new borrowings may be, at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expense and interest payments in the event of increases in interest rates.Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal or pay interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors beyond our control. In addition, we cannot assure you that future borrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, whether in the ordinary course of business or upon an acceleration of such indebtedness, we may pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, revising implementation of or delaying strategic plans or seeking additional equity capital. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. In addition, we cannot assure that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements, or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements.Numerous banks in many countries are syndicate members in our credit facility. Failure of one or more of our larger lenders, or several of our smaller lenders, could significantly reduce availability of our credit, which could harm our liquidity.We may not be able to finance future needs or adapt our business plan to react to changes in economic or business conditions because of restrictions placed on us by our senior credit facilities and any existing or future instruments governing our other indebtedness.Our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain, or future or revised instruments may contain, various restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied. We also must comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests. Our subsidiaries may also be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us. In addition, our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain or may contain additional affirmative and negative covenants. Material existing restrictions are described more fully in the MD&A and Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. Each of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities, such as acquisitions.14If we do not comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness, we could default under those agreements, and the debt, together with accrued interest, could be declared due and payable. If we default under our senior credit facilities, the lenders could cause all our outstanding debt obligations under our senior credit facilities to become due and payable or require us to repay the indebtedness under these facilities. If our debt is accelerated, we may not be able to repay or refinance our debt. In addition, any default under our senior credit facilities or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. If the indebtedness under our senior credit facilities is accelerated, we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due under our senior credit facilities or other debt securities then outstanding. Our ability to comply with these provisions of our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness will be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control. Complying with our covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to us and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete, including against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.Currency conversion risk could have a material impact on our reported results of business operations. Our operating results are presented in U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in which we conduct business could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into U.S. dollars.Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, including countries utilizing the Euro, which may have a material adverse effect on sales or require us to lower our prices, and also decrease our reported revenues or margins related to sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent we are unable or determine not to increase local currency prices. Likewise, the increased strength of the U.S. dollar could allow competitors with foreign-based manufacturing costs to sell their products in the U.S. at lower prices. Alternatively, decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased overseas.Similarly, increased or decreased strength of the currencies of non-U.S. countries in which we manufacture will have a comparable effect against the currencies of other jurisdictions in which we sell. For example, our Radiodetection business manufactures a number of detection instruments in the United Kingdom and sells to customers in other countries, therefore increased strength of the British pound sterling will increase the effective price of these products sold in British pound sterling into other countries; and decreased strength of British pound sterling could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased outside of the United Kingdom.Credit and counterparty risks could harm our business.The financial condition of our customers and distributors could affect our ability to market our products or collect receivables. In addition, financial difficulties faced by our customers may lead to cancellations or delays of orders.Our customers may suffer financial difficulties that make them unable to pay for a project when completed, or they may decide not or be unable to pay us, either as a matter of corporate decision-making or in response to changes in local laws and regulations. We cannot assure you that expenses or losses for uncollectible amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows.Changes in tax laws and regulations or other factors could cause our income tax obligations to increase, potentially reducing our net income and adversely affecting our cash flows.We are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions around the world. In preparing our financial statements, we provide for income taxes based on current tax laws and regulations and the estimated taxable income within each of these jurisdictions. Our income tax obligations, however, may be higher due to numerous factors, including changes in tax laws or regulations and the outcome of audits and examinations of our tax returns.Officials in some of the jurisdictions in which we do business have proposed, or announced that they are reviewing, tax changes that could potentially increase taxes, and other revenue-raising laws and regulations, including those that may be enacted as a result of various OECD projects. Changes in applicable U.S. or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.As indicated in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements, certain of our income tax returns are currently under audit. In connection with these and any future audits, there is a risk that we could be challenged by tax authorities on certain of the tax positions we have taken, or will take, on our tax returns. Although we believe that current tax laws and regulations support our positions, there can be no assurance that tax authorities will agree with our positions. In the event tax authorities 15were to challenge one or more of our tax positions, an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. If the fair value of any of our reporting units is insufficient to recover the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangibles of the respective reporting unit, a material non-cash charge to earnings could result.At December 31, 2020, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net, of $804.9. We conduct annual impairment testing to determine if we will be able to recover all or a portion of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. In addition, we review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment more frequently if impairment indicators arise. If the fair value is insufficient to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, we may be required to record a material non-cash charge to earnings.The fair values of our reporting units generally are based on discounted cash flow projections that are believed to be reasonable under current and forecasted circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of the reported net assets of our reporting units. Other considerations are also incorporated, including comparable price multiples. Many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets that they serve. Accordingly, we consider estimates and judgments that affect the future cash flow projections, including principal methods of competition such as volume, price, service, product performance and technical innovations and estimates associated with cost reduction initiatives, capacity utilization, and assumptions for inflation and foreign currency changes. We monitor impairment indicators across all of our businesses. Significant changes in market conditions and estimates or judgments used to determine expected future cash flows that indicate a reduction in carrying value may give, and have given, rise to impairments in the period that the change becomes known.Cost reduction actions may affect our business.Cost reduction actions often result in charges against earnings. These charges can vary significantly from period to period and, as a result, we may experience fluctuations in our reported net income and earnings per share due to the timing of cost reduction actions.Changes in key estimates and assumptions related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, such as discount rates, assumed long-term return on assets, assumed long-term trends of future cost, and accounting and legislative changes, as well as actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and other actuarial factors, could affect our results of operations and cash flows.We have defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, including both qualified and non-qualified plans, which cover a portion of our salaried and hourly employees and retirees, including a portion of our employees and retirees in foreign countries. As of December 31, 2020, our net liability to these plans was $139.3. The determination of funding requirements and pension expense or income associated with these plans involves significant judgment, particularly with respect to discount rates, long-term trends of future costs and other actuarial assumptions. If our assumptions change significantly due to changes in economic, legislative and/or demographic experience or circumstances, our pension and other benefit plans’ expense, funded status and our required cash contributions to such plans could be negatively impacted. In addition, returns on plan assets could have a material impact on our pension plans’ expense, funded status and our required contributions to the plans. Changes in regulations or law could also significantly impact our obligations. For example, see “MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates” for the impact that changes in certain assumptions used in the calculation of our costs and obligations associated with these plans could have on our results of operations and financial position.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockProvisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company, and accordingly, we may not consummate a transaction that our stockholders consider favorable.Provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws may inhibit changes in control of our company not approved by our Board. These provisions include, for example: a staggered board of directors; a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent; a requirement that special stockholder meetings be called only by our Chairman, President or Board; advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations; limitations on stockholders’ ability to amend, alter or repeal the By-laws; enhanced voting requirements for certain business combinations involving substantial stockholders; the authority of our Board to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with terms determined in its discretion; and limitations on stockholders’ ability to remove directors. In addition, we are afforded the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could have similar effects. In general, Section 203 prohibits us from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” (each as defined in Section 203) for at least three years after the time the person 16became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met. These protective provisions could result in our not consummating a transaction that our stockholders consider favorable or discourage entities from attempting to acquire us, potentially at a significant premium to our then-existing stock price.Increases in the number of shares of our outstanding common stock could adversely affect our common stock price or dilute our earnings per share.Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock into the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. As of December 31, 2020, we had the ability to issue up to an additional 4.407 shares as restricted stock shares, restricted stock units, performance stock units, or stock options under our 2019 Stock Compensation Plan, and 0.027 under our 2006 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Incentive Plan. We also may issue a significant number of additional shares, in connection with acquisitions, through a registration statement, or otherwise. Additional shares issued would have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share.The Spin-Off of SPX FLOW could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders.In connection with the Spin-Off of SPX FLOW, we received opinions of tax counsel satisfactory to us as to the tax-free treatment of the Spin-Off and certain related transactions. However, if the factual assumptions or representations upon which the opinions are based are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, we will not be able to rely on the opinions. Furthermore, the opinions are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or the courts. Accordingly, the IRS may challenge the conclusions set forth in the opinions and any such challenge could prevail. If, notwithstanding the opinions, the Spin-Off or a related transaction is determined to be taxable, we could be subject to a substantial tax liability. In addition, if the Spin-Off is determined to be taxable, each holder of our common stock who received shares of SPX FLOW would generally be treated as having received a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received.The Spin-Off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements.The Spin-Off is subject to review under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. Fraudulent conveyance laws generally provide that an entity engages in a constructive fraudulent conveyance when (1) the entity transfers assets and does not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in return, and (2) the entity (a) is insolvent at the time of the transfer or is rendered insolvent by the transfer, (b) has unreasonably small capital with which to carry on its business, or (c) intends to incur or believes it will incur debts beyond its ability to repay its debts as they mature. An unpaid creditor or an entity acting on behalf of a creditor (including, without limitation, a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy by us or SPX FLOW or any of our respective subsidiaries) may bring a lawsuit alleging that the Spin-Off or any of the related transactions constituted a constructive fraudulent conveyance. If a court accepts these allegations, it could impose a number of remedies, including, without limitation, voiding the distribution and returning SPX FLOW’s assets or SPX FLOW’s shares and subject us to liability.The measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws will vary depending on which jurisdiction’s law is applied. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if (1) the present fair salable value of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (including contingent liabilities); (2) the present fair salable value of its assets is less than its probable liabilities on its debts as such debts become absolute and matured; (3) it cannot pay its debts and other liabilities (including contingent liabilities and other commitments) as they mature; or (4) it has unreasonably small capital for the business in which it is engaged. We cannot assure you what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that we, SPX FLOW or any of our respective subsidiaries were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the Spin-Off.The distribution of SPX FLOW common stock is also subject to review under state corporate distribution statutes. Under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”), a corporation may only pay dividends to its stockholders either (1) out of its surplus (net assets) or (2) if there is no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year.Although we believe that we and SPX FLOW were each solvent at the time of the Spin-Off (including immediately after the distribution of shares of SPX FLOW common stock), that we are able to repay our debts as they mature and have sufficient capital to carry on our businesses, and that the distribution was made entirely out of surplus in accordance with Section 170 of the DGCL, we cannot assure you that a court would reach the same conclusions in determining whether SPX FLOW or we were insolvent at the time of, or after giving effect to, the Spin-Off, or whether lawful funds were available for the separation and the distribution to our stockholders.17"
17,SPXC,SPX CORP,2020-02-14,"ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
(All currency and share amounts are in millions)You should consider the risks described below and elsewhere in our documents filed with the SEC before investing in any of our securities. We may amend, supplement or add to the risk factors described below from time to time in future reports filed with the SEC.Many of the markets in which we operate are cyclical or are subject to industry events, and our results have been and could be affected as a result.Many of the markets in which we operate are subject to general economic cycles or industry events. In addition, certain of our businesses are subject to market-specific cycles and weather-related fluctuations.Furthermore, contract timing on projects, including those relating to power transmission and distribution systems, communication technologies, fare collection systems, and process cooling systems and towers may cause significant fluctuations in revenues and profits from period to period.The businesses of many of our customers are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced, and may continue to experience, periodic downturns. Cyclical changes and specific industry events could also affect sales of products in our other businesses. Downturns in the business cycles of our different operations may occur at the same time, which could exacerbate any adverse effects on our business. In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal and weather-related fluctuations. Historically, many of our key businesses generally have tended to have stronger performance in the second half of the year. See “MD&A - Results of Continuing Operations and Results of Reportable and Other Operating Segments.”We are subject to various claims, disputes, enforcement actions, litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings related to two large power projects in South Africa that could ultimately be resolved against us.Since 2008, DBT has been executing contracts on two large power projects in South Africa (Kusile and Medupi). Over such time, the business environment surrounding these projects has been difficult, as DBT, along with many other contractors on the projects, have experienced delays, cost over-runs, and various other challenges associated with a complex set of contractual relationships among the end customer, prime contractors, various subcontractors (including DBT and its subcontractors), and various suppliers. DBT is currently involved in a number of claims relating to these challenges and may be subject to other claims, which could be significant. We cannot give assurance that these claims and the costs to assert our claims and defend claims against us will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See “MD&A - Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates - Contingent Liabilities” and Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. We are subject to laws, regulations and potential liability relating to claims, complaints and proceedings, including those relating to asbestos, environmental, product liability and other matters.We are subject to various laws, ordinances, regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the United States and other nations. Additionally, changes in laws, ordinances, regulations, or other governmental policies may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities.Numerous claims, complaints, and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business have been asserted or are pending against us or certain of our subsidiaries (collectively, “claims”). These claims relate to litigation matters (e.g., class actions and contracts, intellectual property, and competitive claims), environmental matters, product liability matters (predominately associated with alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials), and other risk management matters (e.g., general liability, automobile, and workers’ compensation claims). Periodically, claims, complaints and proceedings arising other than in the ordinary course of business have been asserted or are pending against us or certain of our subsidiaries (e.g. patent infringement and disputes with subsidiary shareholder(s)), including claims with respect to businesses that we have acquired for matters arising before the relevant date of the acquisition. From time to time, we face actions by governmental authorities, both in and outside the United States. Additionally, we may become subject to other claims of which we are currently unaware, which may be significant, or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring significantly greater loss than we anticipate. Our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable (e.g., because of insurer insolvency) to protect us against potential loss exposures.The liabilities we record for asbestos product liability matters are based on a number of assumptions, including historical claims and payment experience and actuarial estimates of the future period during which additional claims are reasonably foreseeable.  While we base our assumptions on facts currently known to us, they entail inherently subjective judgments and 6uncertainties.  As a result, our current assumptions for estimating these liabilities may not prove accurate, and we may be required to adjust these liabilities in the future, which could result in material charges to earnings.  In addition, a significant increase in claims, costs, and/or issues with existing insurance coverage could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We face environmental exposures including, for example, those relating to discharges from and materials handled as part of our operations, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by petroleum products or hazardous substances or wastes, and the health and safety of our employees. We may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal, or remediation of hazardous substances or petroleum products on, under, or in our current or formerly owned or leased properties, or from third-party disposal facilities that we may have used, without regard to whether we knew of, or caused, the presence of the contaminants. The presence of, or failure to properly remediate, these substances may have adverse effects, including, for example, substantial investigative or remedial obligations and limitations on the ability to sell or rent affected property or to borrow funds using affected property as collateral. New or existing environmental matters or changes in environmental laws or policies could lead to material costs for environmental compliance or cleanup. In addition, environmentally related product regulations are growing globally in number and complexity and could contribute to increased costs with respect to disclosure requirements, product sales and distribution related costs, and post-sale recycling and disposal costs. There can be no assurance that these liabilities and costs will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.We devote significant time and expense to defend against the various claims, complaints, and proceedings brought against us. In addition, from time to time, we bring actions to enforce our rights against customers, suppliers, insurers, and other third parties. We cannot assure you that the expenses or distractions from operating our businesses arising from these defenses and actions will not increase materially.We cannot assure you that our accruals and right to indemnity and insurance will be sufficient, that recoveries from insurance or indemnification claims will be available or that any of our current or future claims or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.See “MD&A - Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates - Contingent Liabilities” and Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.The price and availability of raw materials and components has and may adversely affect our business. We are exposed to a variety of risks relating to the price and availability of raw materials and components. In recent years, we have faced volatility in the prices of many key raw materials (e.g., copper, steel and oil) and key components (e.g. circuit boards), including price increases in response to trade laws and tariffs. Increases in the prices of raw materials and components, including as a result of new or increased tariffs or the impact of new trade laws, or shortages or allocations of materials and components may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as there may be delays in our ability, or we may not be able, to pass cost increases on to our customers, or our sales may be reduced. We are subject to, or may enter into, long-term supplier contracts that may increase our exposure to pricing fluctuations.If we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted. We are increasingly dependent on cloud-based and other information technology (“IT”) networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information. We depend on such IT infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and between our personnel and suppliers and customers. In addition, we rely on these IT systems to record, process, summarize, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including, among other things, our accounting and financial reporting processes; our manufacturing and supply chain processes; our sales and marketing efforts; and the data related to our research and development efforts. The failure of our IT systems or those of our business partners or third-party service providers to perform properly, or difficulties encountered in the development of new systems or the upgrade of existing systems, could disrupt our business and harm our reputation, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess or obsolete inventory, and product shortages, causing our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results to suffer. Upon expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third-party vendors, we may not be able to replace the services provided to us in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable to us, and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete.7IT security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication and we have detected numerous attempts to compromise the security of our IT systems. Cyber-attacks may be random, coordinated, or targeted, including sophisticated computer crime threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, and those of our business partners and third-party service providers, and to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. Despite our implementation of security measures, cybersecurity threats, such as malicious software, phishing attacks, computer viruses, and attempts to gain unauthorized access, cannot be completely mitigated. Our business, reputation, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if, as a result of a significant cyber event or otherwise, our operations are disrupted or shutdown; our confidential, proprietary information is stolen or disclosed; the performance or security of our cloud-based product offerings is impacted; our intranet and internet sites are compromised; data is manipulated or destroyed; we incur costs or are required to pay fines in connection with stolen customer, employee, or other confidential information; we must dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection; or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs.In addition, newer generations of certain of our products include IT systems, including systems that are cloud-based and/or interconnect through the internet. These systems are subject to the same cybersecurity threats described above and the failure of these systems, including by cyber-attack, could disrupt our customers’ business, leading to potential exposure for us.Our technology is important to our success, and failure to develop new products or make the appropriate investment in technology advancements may result in the loss of any sustainable competitive advantage in products, services and processes.We believe the development of our intellectual property rights is critical to the success of our business. In order to maintain our market positions and margins, we need to regularly develop and introduce high-quality, technologically advanced and cost-effective products on a timely basis, in many cases in multiple jurisdictions around the world. Information technology systems, platforms and products are critical to our operating environment, product offerings and competitive position. Certain digitalization initiatives important to our long-term success may require capital investment, have significant risks associated with their execution, and could take several years to implement. If we do not accurately predict, prepare and respond to new technology innovations, market developments and changing customer needs, our revenues, profitability and long-term competitiveness could be materially adversely affected.Our business depends on capital investment and maintenance expenditures by our customers.Demand for most of our products and services depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by our customers. The level of capital expenditures by our customers fluctuates based on planned expansions, new builds and repairs, commodity prices, general economic conditions, availability of credit, and expectations of future market behavior. Any of these factors, whether individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, in turn, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The fact that we outsource various elements of the products and services we sell subjects us to the business risks of our suppliers and subcontractors, which could have a material adverse impact on our operations.In areas where we depend on third-party suppliers and subcontractors for outsourced products, components or services, we are subject to the risk of customer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of the products or services we sell due to supplier or subcontractor failure. In addition, business difficulties experienced by a third-party supplier or subcontractor can lead to the interruption of our ability to obtain outsourced products or services and ultimately our inability to supply products or services to our customers. Third-party supplier and subcontractor business interruptions can include, but are not limited to, work stoppages, union negotiations and other labor disputes. Current economic conditions could also impact the ability of suppliers and subcontractors to access credit and, thus, impair their ability to provide us quality products or services in a timely manner, or at all.Cost overruns, inflation, delays and other risks could significantly impact our results, particularly with respect to fixed-price contracts.A portion of our revenues and earnings is generated through fixed-price contracts, particularly within our Engineered Solutions reportable segment. We recognize revenues for certain of these contracts over-time whereby revenues and expenses, and thereby profit, in a given period are determined based on our estimates as to the project status and the costs remaining to complete a particular project.8Estimates of total revenues and cost at completion are subject to many variables, including the length of time to complete a contract. In addition, contract delays may negatively impact these estimates and our revenues and earnings results for affected periods.To the extent that we underestimate the remaining cost to complete a project, we may overstate the revenues and profit in a particular period. Further, certain of these contracts provide for penalties or liquidated damages for failure to timely perform our obligations under the contract, or require that we, at our expense, correct and remedy to the satisfaction of the other party certain defects. Because some of our contracts are at a fixed price, we face the risk that cost overruns or inflation may exceed, erode or eliminate our expected profit margin, or cause us to record a loss on our projects.Failure to protect or unauthorized use of our intellectual property may harm our business.Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology or knowledge, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as in the United States. Costs incurred to defend our rights may be material.Acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges.Our acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:•Adverse effects on our reported operating results due to charges to earnings, including potential impairment charges associated with goodwill and other intangibles;•Diversion of management attention from core business operations;•Integration of technology, operations, personnel and financial and other systems;•Increased expenses;•Increased foreign operations, often with unique issues relating to corporate culture, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and other challenges;•Assumption of known and unknown liabilities and exposure to litigation;•Increased levels of debt or dilution to existing stockholders; and•Potential disputes with the sellers of acquired businesses.We conduct operational, financial, tax, and legal due diligence on all acquisitions; however, we cannot assure that all potential risks or liabilities are adequately discovered, disclosed, or understood in each instance.In addition, internal controls over financial reporting of acquired companies may not be compliant with required standards. Issues may exist that could rise to the level of significant deficiencies or, in some cases, material weaknesses, particularly with respect to foreign companies or non-public U.S. companies.Our integration activities may place substantial demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. Customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business, technology, service or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.Our failure to successfully complete acquisitions could negatively affect us.We may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions, which could materially impact our growth rate, results of operations, future cash flows and stock price. Our ability to achieve our goals depends upon, among other things, our ability to identify and successfully acquire companies, businesses and product lines, to effectively integrate them and to achieve cost savings. We may also be unable to raise additional funds necessary to consummate these acquisitions. In addition, decreases in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to consummate acquisitions. Competition for acquisitions in our business areas may be significant and result in higher prices for businesses, including businesses that we may target, which may also affect our acquisition rate or benefits achieved from our acquisitions.We may not achieve the expected cost savings and other benefits of our acquisitions.We strive for and expect to achieve cost savings in connection with our acquisitions, including: (i) manufacturing process and supply chain rationalization, (ii) streamlining redundant administrative overhead and support activities, (iii) restructuring and repositioning sales and marketing organizations to eliminate redundancies, and (iv) achieving anticipated revenue synergies. Cost savings expectations are estimates that are inherently difficult to predict and are necessarily speculative in nature, and we cannot assure you that we will achieve expected, or any, cost savings in connection with an acquisition. In 9addition, we cannot assure you that unforeseen factors will not offset the estimated cost savings or other benefits from our acquisitions. As a result, anticipated benefits could be delayed, differ significantly from our estimates and the other information contained in this report, or not be realized.Dispositions or liabilities retained in connection with dispositions could negatively affect us.Our dispositions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from running our core businesses, increased expense associated with the dispositions, potential disputes with the customers or suppliers of the disposed businesses, potential disputes with the acquirers of the disposed businesses and a potential dilutive effect on our earnings per share. In addition, we have agreed to retain certain liabilities in connection with the disposition of certain businesses, including the Balcke Dürr business. These liabilities may be significant and could negatively impact our business.If dispositions are not completed in a timely manner, there may be a negative effect on our cash flows and/or our ability to execute our strategy. In addition, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of our dispositions. See “Business,” “MD&A - Results of Discontinued Operations,” and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for the status of our divestitures.Governmental laws and regulations could negatively affect our business.Changes in laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject could have a significant negative impact on our business. In addition, we could face material costs and risks if it is determined that we have failed to comply with relevant law and regulation. We are subject to U.S. Customs and Export Regulations, including U.S. International Traffic and Arms Regulations and similar laws, which collectively control import, export and sale of technologies by companies and various other aspects of the operation of our business; the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws, which prohibit companies from making improper payments to government officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business; the California Transparency in Supply Chain Act and similar laws and regulations, which relate to human trafficking and anti-slavery and impose new compliance requirements on our businesses and their suppliers; and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and the European General Data Protection Regulation, which establish data management requirements for the protection of personal information of individuals. While our policies and procedures mandate compliance with such laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees and agents will always act in strict compliance. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations may result in civil and criminal enforcement, including monetary fines and possible injunctions against shipment of product or other of our activities, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Several of our businesses are reliant on or may be directly impacted by government regulations. Changes to these regulations may have a significant negative impact on these businesses. For example, (i) a reduction of Federal Aviation Administration regulations mandating lighting of towers and buildings at height; (ii) increases in Department of Energy regulations on energy efficiency requirements for heating, and (iii) a reduction in regulations requiring 811 calls to be made before the commencement of a digging project, could have a significant negative impact on these businesses. While we monitor these regulations and our businesses plan for potential changes, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt in each circumstance. Failure to adapt if regulations change could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Difficulties presented by domestic economic, political, legal, accounting and business factors could negatively affect our business.In 2019, approximately 91% of our revenues were generated inside the United States. Our reliance on U.S. revenues and U.S. manufacturing bases exposes us to a number of risks, including:•Government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions such as antidumping duties, as well as the imposition of trade sanctions by the United States against a class of products imported from or sold and exported to, or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with, countries in which we conduct business, could significantly increase our cost of products imported into or exported from the United States or reduce our sales and harm our business and the relaxation of embargoes and foreign trade restrictions, including antidumping duties on transformers, by the United States could adversely affect the market for our products in the United States;•Customs and tariffs may make it difficult or impossible for us to move our products or assets across borders in a cost-effective manner and may increase the cost of our raw materials, including raw materials sourced domestically;•Transportation and shipping expenses add cost to our products;•Complications related to shipping, including delays due to weather, labor action, or customs, may impact our profit margins or lead to lost business;10•Environmental and other laws and regulations could increase our costs or limit our ability to run our business; and•Our ability to obtain supplies from foreign vendors and ship products internationally may be impaired during times of crisis or otherwise.Any of the above factors or other factors affecting the movement of people and products into and from various countries to North America could have a significant negative effect on our operations. In addition, our concentration on U.S. business may make it difficult to enter new markets, making it more difficult for our businesses to grow.Worldwide economic conditions could negatively impact our businesses.Many of our customers historically have tended to delay capital projects, including expensive maintenance and upgrades, during economic downturns. Poor macroeconomic conditions could negatively impact our businesses by adversely affecting, among other things, our: •Revenues;•Margins;•Profits;•Cash flows;•Customers’ orders, including order cancellation activity or delays on existing orders;•Customers’ ability to access credit;•Customers’ ability to pay amounts due to us; and•Suppliers’ and distributors’ ability to perform and the availability and costs of materials and subcontracted services.Downturns in global economies could negatively impact our performance or any expectations in reporting performance. Our non-U.S. revenues and operations expose us to numerous risks that may negatively impact our business.To the extent we generate revenues outside of the United States, non-U.S. revenues and non-U.S. manufacturing bases exposes us to a number of risks, including:•Significant competition could come from local or long-term participants in non-U.S. markets who may have significantly greater market knowledge and substantially greater resources than we do;•Local customers may have a preference for locally-produced products;•Credit risk or financial condition of local customers and distributors could affect our ability to market our products or collect receivables;•Regulatory or political systems or barriers may make it difficult or impossible to enter or remain in new markets. In addition, these barriers may impact our existing businesses, including making it more difficult for them to grow;•Local political, economic and social conditions, including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions, political instability, nationalization of private enterprises, or unexpected changes relating to currency could adversely impact our revenues and operations;•The United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) has contributed to, and may continue to contribute to, economic, currency, market and regulatory uncertainty in the United Kingdom and European Union and could adversely affect economic, currency, market, regulatory, or political conditions both in those regions and worldwide;•Customs, tariffs and trade restrictions may make it difficult or impossible for us to move our products or assets across borders in a cost-effective manner;•Transportation and shipping expenses add cost to our products;•Complications related to shipping, including delays due to weather, labor action, or customs, may impact our profit margins or lead to lost business;•Local, regional or worldwide hostilities could impact our operations;•Distance and language and cultural differences may make it more difficult to manage our business and employees and to effectively market our products and services; and•Public health crises, including the outbreak of a pandemic or contagious disease.Any of the above factors or other factors affecting social and economic activity in the United Kingdom, China, and South Africa or affecting the movement of people and products into and from these countries to our major markets, could have a significant negative effect on our operations.11Our customers have been and could be impacted by commodity availability and prices. A number of factors outside our control, including fluctuating commodity prices, impact the demand for our products. Increased commodity prices, including as a result of new or increased tariffs or the impact of new trade laws, may increase our customers’ cost of doing business, thus causing them to delay or cancel large capital projects.On the other hand, declining commodity prices may cause our customers to delay or cancel projects relating to the production of such commodities. Reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity, which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. Reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in the relevant market.The loss of key personnel and an inability to attract and retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations.We are dependent on the continued services of our leadership team. The loss of these personnel without adequate replacement could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience in many locations in order to operate our business successfully. From time to time, there may be a shortage of qualified managers or skilled labor, which may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain qualified employees. If we were unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals or our costs to do so were to increase significantly, our operations could be materially adversely affected.Our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.At December 31, 2019, we had $393.5 in total indebtedness. On that same date, we had $292.7 of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities, after giving effect to $17.3 reserved for outstanding letters of credit and $140.0 of borrowings under the revolving credit agreement, and $36.8 of available borrowing capacity under our trade receivables financing arrangement. In addition, at December 31, 2019, we had $2.2 of available issuance capacity under our foreign credit instrument facilities after giving effect to $97.8 reserved for outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2019, our cash and equivalents balance was $54.7. See MD&A and Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance, or assumed in connection with, acquisitions. We may renegotiate or refinance our senior credit facilities or other debt facilities, or enter into additional agreements that have different or more stringent terms. The level of our indebtedness could:•Impact our ability to obtain new, or refinance existing, indebtedness, on favorable terms or at all;•Limit our ability to obtain, or obtain on favorable terms, additional debt financing for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions;•Limit our flexibility in reacting to competitive and other changes in the industry and economic conditions;•Limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock in the future;•Coupled with a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows due to economic developments or adverse developments in our business, make it difficult to meet debt service requirements; and•Expose us to interest rate fluctuations to the extent existing borrowings are, and any new borrowings may be, at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expense and interest payments in the event of increases in interest rates.Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal or pay interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors beyond our control. In addition, we cannot assure you that future borrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, whether in the ordinary course of business or upon an acceleration of such indebtedness, we may pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, revising implementation of or delaying strategic plans or seeking additional equity capital. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. In addition, we cannot assure that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements, or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements.Numerous banks in many countries are syndicate members in our credit facility. Failure of one or more of our larger lenders, or several of our smaller lenders, could significantly reduce availability of our credit, which could harm our liquidity.12We may not be able to finance future needs or adapt our business plan to react to changes in economic or business conditions because of restrictions placed on us by our senior credit facilities and any existing or future instruments governing our other indebtedness.Our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain, or future or revised instruments may contain, various restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied. We also must comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests. Our subsidiaries may also be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us. In addition, our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain or may contain additional affirmative and negative covenants. Material existing restrictions are described more fully in the MD&A and Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. Each of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities, such as acquisitions.If we do not comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness, we could default under those agreements, and the debt, together with accrued interest, could be declared due and payable. If we default under our senior credit facilities, the lenders could cause all our outstanding debt obligations under our senior credit facilities to become due and payable or require us to repay the indebtedness under these facilities. If our debt is accelerated, we may not be able to repay or refinance our debt. In addition, any default under our senior credit facilities or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. If the indebtedness under our senior credit facilities is accelerated, we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due under our senior credit facilities or other debt securities then outstanding. Our ability to comply with these provisions of our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness will be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control. Complying with our covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to us and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete, including against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.Currency conversion risk could have a material impact on our reported results of business operations. Our operating results are presented in U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in which we conduct business could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into U.S. dollars.Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, including countries utilizing the Euro, which may have a material adverse effect on sales or require us to lower our prices, and also decrease our reported revenues or margins related to sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent we are unable or determine not to increase local currency prices. Likewise, the increased strength of the U.S. dollar could allow competitors with foreign-based manufacturing costs to sell their products in the U.S. at lower prices. Alternatively, decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased overseas.Similarly, increased or decreased strength of the currencies of non-U.S. countries in which we manufacture will have a comparable effect against the currencies of other jurisdictions in which we sell. For example, our Radiodetection business manufactures a number of detection instruments in the United Kingdom and sells to customers in other countries, therefore increased strength of the British pound sterling will increase the effective price of these products sold in British pound sterling into other countries; and decreased strength of British pound sterling could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased outside of the United Kingdom.Credit and counterparty risks could harm our business.The financial condition of our customers and distributors could affect our ability to market our products or collect receivables. In addition, financial difficulties faced by our customers may lead to cancellations or delays of orders.Our customers may suffer financial difficulties that make them unable to pay for a project when completed, or they may decide not or be unable to pay us, either as a matter of corporate decision-making or in response to changes in local laws and regulations. We cannot assure you that expenses or losses for uncollectible amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows.We operate in highly competitive markets. Our failure to compete effectively could harm our business. We sell our products in highly competitive markets, which could result in pressure on our profit margins and limit our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products. We compete on a number of fronts, including on the basis of 13service, product performance, technical innovation and price. We have a number of competitors with substantial technological and financial resources, brand recognition and established relationships with global service providers. Some of our competitors have lower cost structures, support from local governments, or both. In addition, new competitors may enter the markets in which we participate. Competitors may be able to offer lower prices, additional products or services or a more attractive mix of products or services, or services or other incentives that we cannot or will not match. These competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new or emerging technologies and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns and make more attractive offers to potential customers, employees and strategic partners. In addition, competitive environments in slow-growth markets, to which some of our businesses have exposure, have been inherently more influenced by pricing and domestic and global economic conditions. To remain competitive, we need to invest in manufacturing, marketing, customer service and support, and our distribution networks. No assurances can be made that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make the investment required to maintain or increase our market share or that our investments will be successful. If we do not compete successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.Changes in tax laws and regulations or other factors could cause our income tax obligations to increase, potentially reducing our net income and adversely affecting our cash flows.We are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions around the world. In preparing our financial statements, we provide for income taxes based on current tax laws and regulations and the estimated taxable income within each of these jurisdictions. Our income tax obligations, however, may be higher due to numerous factors, including changes in tax laws or regulations and the outcome of audits and examinations of our tax returns.Officials in some of the jurisdictions in which we do business have proposed, or announced that they are reviewing, tax changes that could potentially increase taxes, and other revenue-raising laws and regulations, including those that may be enacted as a result of the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project. Changes in applicable U.S. or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.As indicated in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements, certain of our income tax returns are currently under audit. In connection with these and any future audits, there is a risk that we could be challenged by tax authorities on certain of the tax positions we have taken, or will take, on our tax returns. Although we believe that current tax laws and regulations support our positions, there can be no assurance that tax authorities will agree with our positions. In the event tax authorities were to challenge one or more of our tax positions, an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. If the fair value of any of our reporting units is insufficient to recover the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangibles of the respective reporting unit, a material non-cash charge to earnings could result.At December 31, 2019, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net, of $701.0. We conduct annual impairment testing to determine if we will be able to recover all or a portion of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. In addition, we review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment more frequently if impairment indicators arise. If the fair value is insufficient to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, we may be required to record a material non-cash charge to earnings.The fair values of our reporting units generally are based on discounted cash flow projections that are believed to be reasonable under current and forecasted circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of the reported net assets of our reporting units. Other considerations are also incorporated, including comparable price multiples. Many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets that they serve. Accordingly, we consider estimates and judgments that affect the future cash flow projections, including principal methods of competition such as volume, price, service, product performance and technical innovations and estimates associated with cost reduction initiatives, capacity utilization, and assumptions for inflation and foreign currency changes. We monitor impairment indicators across all of our businesses. Significant changes in market conditions and estimates or judgments used to determine expected future cash flows that indicate a reduction in carrying value may give, and have given, rise to impairments in the period that the change becomes known.Cost reduction actions may affect our business.Cost reduction actions often result in charges against earnings. These charges can vary significantly from period to period and, as a result, we may experience fluctuations in our reported net income and earnings per share due to the timing of restructuring actions.14Our current and planned products may contain defects or errors that are detected only after delivery to customers. If that occurs, our reputation may be harmed and we may face additional costs.We cannot assure you that our product development, manufacturing and integration testing will be adequate to detect all defects, errors, failures and quality issues that could impact customer satisfaction or result in claims against us with regard to our products. As a result, we may have, and from time to time have had, to replace certain components and/or provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects in products that are shipped. The occurrence of any defects, errors, failures or quality issues could result in cancellation of orders, product returns, diversion of our resources, legal actions by our customers or our customers’ end users and other losses to us or to any of our customers or end users, and could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and loss of sales, which would harm our business and adversely affect our revenues, profitability and cash flows.Changes in key estimates and assumptions related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, such as discount rates, assumed long-term return on assets, assumed long-term trends of future cost, and accounting and legislative changes, as well as actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and other actuarial factors, could affect our results of operations and cash flows.We have defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, including both qualified and non-qualified plans, which cover a portion of our salaried and hourly employees and retirees, including a portion of our employees and retirees in foreign countries. As of December 31, 2019, our net liability to these plans was $145.1. The determination of funding requirements and pension expense or income associated with these plans involves significant judgment, particularly with respect to discount rates, long-term trends of future costs and other actuarial assumptions. If our assumptions change significantly due to changes in economic, legislative and/or demographic experience or circumstances, our pension and other benefit plans’ expense, funded status and our required cash contributions to such plans could be negatively impacted. In addition, returns on plan assets could have a material impact on our pension plans’ expense, funded status and our required contributions to the plans. Changes in regulations or law could also significantly impact our obligations. For example, see “MD&A - Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates” for the impact that changes in certain assumptions used in the calculation of our costs and obligations associated with these plans could have on our results of operations and financial position.We are subject to work stoppages, union negotiations, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force, which may adversely impact our operations and cause us to incur incremental costs.At December 31, 2019, we had eight domestic collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 1,150 of our over 4,500 employees. One of these collective bargaining agreements expires in 2020 and is scheduled for negotiation and renewal. We also have various collective labor arrangements covering certain non-U.S. employee groups. We are subject to potential union campaigns, work stoppages, union negotiations and other potential labor disputes. Further, we may be subject to work stoppages, which are beyond our control, at our suppliers or customers.Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company, and accordingly, we may not consummate a transaction that our stockholders consider favorable.Provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws may inhibit changes in control of our company not approved by our Board. These provisions include, for example: a staggered board of directors; a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent; a requirement that special stockholder meetings be called only by our Chairman, President or Board; advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations; limitations on stockholders’ ability to amend, alter or repeal the By-laws; enhanced voting requirements for certain business combinations involving substantial stockholders; the authority of our Board to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with terms determined in its discretion; and limitations on stockholders’ ability to remove directors. In addition, we are afforded the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could have similar effects. In general, Section 203 prohibits us from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” (each as defined in Section 203) for at least three years after the time the person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met. These protective provisions could result in our not consummating a transaction that our stockholders consider favorable or discourage entities from attempting to acquire us, potentially at a significant premium to our then-existing stock price.Increases in the number of shares of our outstanding common stock could adversely affect our common stock price or dilute our earnings per share.Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock into the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. As of December 31, 2019, we had the ability to issue up to an additional 4.917 shares as restricted stock shares, restricted stock units, performance stock units, or stock options under our 152019 Stock Compensation Plan, and 0.027 under our 2006 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Incentive Plan. We also may issue a significant number of additional shares, in connection with acquisitions, through a registration statement, or otherwise. Additional shares issued would have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share.The Spin-Off of SPX FLOW could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders.In connection with the Spin-Off of SPX FLOW we received opinions of tax counsel satisfactory to us as to the tax-free treatment of the Spin-Off and certain related transactions. However, if the factual assumptions or representations upon which the opinions are based are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, we will not be able to rely on the opinions. Furthermore, the opinions are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or the courts. Accordingly, the IRS may challenge the conclusions set forth in the opinions and any such challenge could prevail. If, notwithstanding the opinions, the Spin-Off or a related transaction is determined to be taxable, we could be subject to a substantial tax liability. In addition, if the Spin-Off is determined to be taxable, each holder of our common stock who received shares of SPX FLOW would generally be treated as having received a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received.The Spin-Off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements.The Spin-Off is subject to review under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. Fraudulent conveyance laws generally provide that an entity engages in a constructive fraudulent conveyance when (1) the entity transfers assets and does not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in return, and (2) the entity (a) is insolvent at the time of the transfer or is rendered insolvent by the transfer, (b) has unreasonably small capital with which to carry on its business, or (c) intends to incur or believes it will incur debts beyond its ability to repay its debts as they mature. An unpaid creditor or an entity acting on behalf of a creditor (including, without limitation, a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy by us or SPX FLOW or any of our respective subsidiaries) may bring a lawsuit alleging that the Spin-Off or any of the related transactions constituted a constructive fraudulent conveyance. If a court accepts these allegations, it could impose a number of remedies, including, without limitation, voiding the distribution and returning SPX FLOW’s assets or SPX FLOW’s shares and subject us to liability.The measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws will vary depending on which jurisdiction’s law is applied. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if (1) the present fair salable value of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (including contingent liabilities); (2) the present fair salable value of its assets is less than its probable liabilities on its debts as such debts become absolute and matured; (3) it cannot pay its debts and other liabilities (including contingent liabilities and other commitments) as they mature; or (4) it has unreasonably small capital for the business in which it is engaged. We cannot assure you what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that we, SPX FLOW or any of our respective subsidiaries were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the Spin-Off.The distribution of SPX FLOW common stock is also subject to review under state corporate distribution statutes. Under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”), a corporation may only pay dividends to its stockholders either (1) out of its surplus (net assets) or (2) if there is no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year.Although we believe that we and SPX FLOW were each solvent at the time of the Spin-Off (including immediately after the distribution of shares of SPX FLOW common stock), that we are able to repay our debts as they mature and have sufficient capital to carry on our businesses, and that the distribution was made entirely out of surplus in accordance with Section 170 of the DGCL, we cannot assure you that a court would reach the same conclusions in determining whether SPX FLOW or we were insolvent at the time of, or after giving effect to, the Spin-Off, or whether lawful funds were available for the separation and the distribution to our stockholders.16"
7,SPXC,SPX CORP,2019-02-15,"ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
(All currency and share amounts are in millions)You should consider the risks described below and elsewhere in our documents filed with the SEC before investing in any of our securities. We may amend, supplement or add to the risk factors described below from time to time in future reports filed with the SEC.Many of the markets in which we operate are cyclical or are subject to industry events, and our results have been and could be affected as a result.Many of the markets in which we operate are subject to general economic cycles or industry events. In addition, certain of our businesses are subject to market-specific cycles and weather-related fluctuations.Furthermore, contract timing on projects, including those relating to power transmission and distribution systems, communication technologies, fare collection systems, and process cooling systems and towers may cause significant fluctuations in revenues and profits from period to period.The businesses of many of our customers are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced, and may continue to experience, periodic downturns. Cyclical changes and specific industry events could also affect sales of products in our other businesses. Downturns in the business cycles of our different operations may occur at the same time, which could exacerbate any adverse effects on our business. In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal and weather-related fluctuations. Historically, many of our key businesses generally have tended to have stronger performance in the second half of the year. See ""MD&A - Results of Continuing Operations and Results of Reportable and Other Operating Segments.""The price and availability of raw materials and components has and may adversely affect our business. We are exposed to a variety of risks relating to the price and availability of raw materials and components. In recent years, we have faced volatility in the prices of many key raw materials (e.g., copper, steel and oil) and key components (e.g. circuit boards), including price increases in response to trade laws and tariffs. Increases in the prices of raw materials and components, including as a result of new or increased tariffs or the impact of new trade laws, or shortages or allocations of materials and components may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as there may be delays in our ability, or we may not be able, to pass cost increases on to our customers, or our sales may be reduced. We are subject to, or may enter into, long-term supplier contracts that may increase our exposure to pricing fluctuations.Our business depends on capital investment and maintenance expenditures by our customers.Demand for most of our products and services depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by our customers. The level of capital expenditures by our customers fluctuates based on planned expansions, new builds and repairs, commodity prices, general economic conditions, availability of credit, and expectations of future market behavior. Any of these factors, whether individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, in turn, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The fact that we outsource various elements of the products and services we sell subjects us to the business risks of our suppliers and subcontractors, which could have a material adverse impact on our operations.In areas where we depend on third-party suppliers and subcontractors for outsourced products, components or services, we are subject to the risk of customer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of the products or services we sell due to supplier or subcontractor failure. In addition, business difficulties experienced by a third-party supplier or subcontractor can lead to the interruption of our ability to obtain outsourced products or services and ultimately our inability to supply products or services to our customers. Third-party supplier and subcontractor business interruptions can include, but are not limited to, work stoppages, union negotiations and other labor disputes. Current economic conditions could also impact the ability of suppliers and subcontractors to access credit and, thus, impair their ability to provide us quality products or services in a timely manner, or at all.Cost overruns, inflation, delays and other risks could significantly impact our results, particularly with respect to fixed-price contracts.A portion of our revenues and earnings is generated through fixed-price contracts, particularly within our Engineered Solutions reportable segment and our “All Other” group of operating segments. We recognize revenues for certain of these contracts over-6time whereby revenues and expenses, and thereby profit, in a given period are determined based on our estimates as to the project status and the costs remaining to complete a particular project.Estimates of total revenues and cost at completion are subject to many variables, including the length of time to complete a contract. In addition, contract delays may negatively impact these estimates and our revenues and earnings results for affected periods.To the extent that we underestimate the remaining cost to complete a project, we may overstate the revenues and profit in a particular period. Further, certain of these contracts provide for penalties or liquidated damages for failure to timely perform our obligations under the contract, or require that we, at our expense, correct and remedy to the satisfaction of the other party certain defects. Because some of our contracts are at a fixed price, we face the risk that cost overruns or inflation may exceed, erode or eliminate our expected profit margin, or cause us to record a loss on our projects.DBT’s contracts on two large power projects in South Africa highlight these types of contract-related risks. The business environment surrounding these projects has been difficult, as DBT has experienced delays, cost over-runs, and various other challenges associated with a complex set of contractual relationships among the end customer, prime contractors, various subcontractors (including DBT and its subcontractors), and various suppliers. These challenges have resulted in (i) significant adjustments to our revenue and cost estimates for the projects and (ii) various claims and disputes between DBT and other parties involved with the projects (e.g., prime contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, etc.).  We may become subject to other claims, which could be significant.  Our future financial position, operating results, and cash flows could be impacted by the resolution of current and any future claims, as well as potential changes to revenue and cost estimates relating to the execution of DBT’s remaining scope.Although we believe that our current estimates of revenues and costs relating to our long-term contracts are reasonable, it is possible that future revisions of such estimates could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.If we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted. We are increasingly dependent on cloud-based and other information technology (“IT”) networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information. We depend on such IT infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and between our personnel and suppliers and customers. In addition, we rely on these IT systems to record, process, summarize, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including, among other things, our accounting and financial reporting processes; our manufacturing and supply chain processes; our sales and marketing efforts; and the data related to our research and development efforts. The failure of our IT systems or those of our business partners or third-party service providers to perform properly, or difficulties encountered in the development of new systems or the upgrade of existing systems, could disrupt our business and harm our reputation, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess or obsolete inventory, and product shortages, causing our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results to suffer. Upon expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third-party vendors, we may not be able to replace the services provided to us in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable to us, and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete.IT security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication and we have detected numerous attempts to compromise the security of our IT systems. Cyber-attacks may be random, coordinated, or targeted, including sophisticated computer crime threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, and those of our business partners and third-party service providers, and to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. Despite our implementation of security measures, cybersecurity threats, such as malicious software, phishing attacks, computer viruses, and attempts to gain unauthorized access, cannot be completely mitigated. Our business, reputation, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if, as a result of a significant cyber event or otherwise, our operations are disrupted or shutdown; our confidential, proprietary information is stolen or disclosed; the performance or security of our cloud-based product offerings is impacted; our intranet and internet sites are compromised; data is manipulated or destroyed; we incur costs or are required to pay fines in connection with stolen customer, employee, or other confidential information; we must dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection; or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs.In addition, newer generations of certain of our products include IT systems, including systems that are cloud-based and/or interconnect through the internet. These systems are subject to the same cybersecurity threats described above and the failure of these systems, including by cyber-attack, could disrupt our customers’ business, leading to potential exposure for us.7Failure to protect or unauthorized use of our intellectual property may harm our business.Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology or knowledge, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as in the United States. Costs incurred to defend our rights may be material.We are subject to laws, regulations and potential liability relating to claims, complaints and proceedings, including those relating to asbestos, environmental, product liability and other matters.We are subject to various laws, ordinances, regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the United States and other nations. Additionally, changes in laws, ordinances, regulations, or other governmental policies may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities.Numerous claims, complaints, and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business have been asserted or are pending against us or certain of our subsidiaries (collectively, “claims”). These claims relate to litigation matters (e.g., class actions and contracts, intellectual property, and competitive claims), environmental matters, product liability matters (predominately associated with alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials), and other risk management matters (e.g., general liability, automobile, and workers’ compensation claims). Periodically, claims, complaints and proceedings arising other than in the ordinary course of business have been asserted or are pending against us or certain of our subsidiaries (e.g. patent infringement and disputes with subsidiary shareholder(s)), including claims with respect to businesses that we have acquired for matters arising before the relevant date of the acquisition. From time to time, we face actions by governmental authorities, both in and outside the United States. Additionally, we may become subject to other claims of which we are currently unaware, which may be significant, or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring significantly greater loss than we anticipate. Our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable (e.g., because of insurer insolvency) to protect us against potential loss exposures.On the two large power projects in South Africa, DBT has experienced delays, cost over-runs, and various other challenges associated with a complex set of contractual relationships among the end customer, prime contractors, various subcontractors (including DBT and its subcontractors), and various suppliers. DBT is currently involved in a number of claims relating to these challenges and may be subject to other claims, which could be significant. We cannot assure you that that these claims and the costs to assert our claims and defend claims made against us will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We face environmental exposures including, for example, those relating to discharges from and materials handled as part of our operations, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by petroleum products or hazardous substances or wastes, and the health and safety of our employees. We may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal, or remediation of hazardous substances or petroleum products on, under, or in our current or formerly owned or leased properties, or from third-party disposal facilities that we may have used, without regard to whether we knew of, or caused, the presence of the contaminants. The presence of, or failure to properly remediate, these substances may have adverse effects, including, for example, substantial investigative or remedial obligations and limitations on the ability to sell or rent affected property or to borrow funds using affected property as collateral. New or existing environmental matters or changes in environmental laws or policies could lead to material costs for environmental compliance or cleanup. In addition, environmentally related product regulations are growing globally in number and complexity and could contribute to increased costs with respect to disclosure requirements, product sales and distribution related costs, and post-sale recycling and disposal costs. There can be no assurance that these liabilities and costs will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.We devote significant time and expense to defend against the various claims, complaints, and proceedings brought against us. In addition, from time to time, we bring actions to enforce our rights against customers, suppliers, insurers, and other third parties. We cannot assure you that the expenses or distractions from operating our businesses arising from these defenses and actions will not increase materially.We cannot assure you that our accruals and right to indemnity and insurance will be sufficient, that recoveries from insurance or indemnification claims will be available or that any of our current or future claims or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.See “MD&A - Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates - Contingent Liabilities” and Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.8Our failure to successfully complete acquisitions could negatively affect us.We may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions, which could materially impact our growth rate, results of operations, future cash flows and stock price. Our ability to achieve our goals depends upon, among other things, our ability to identify and successfully acquire companies, businesses and product lines, to effectively integrate them and to achieve cost savings. We may also be unable to raise additional funds necessary to consummate these acquisitions. In addition, decreases in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to consummate acquisitions. Competition for acquisitions in our business areas may be significant and result in higher prices for businesses, including businesses that we may target, which may also affect our acquisition rate or benefits achieved from our acquisitions.We may not achieve the expected cost savings and other benefits of our acquisitions.We strive for and expect to achieve cost savings in connection with our acquisitions, including: (i) manufacturing process and supply chain rationalization, (ii) streamlining redundant administrative overhead and support activities, (iii) restructuring and repositioning sales and marketing organizations to eliminate redundancies, and (iv) achieving anticipated revenue synergies. Cost savings expectations are estimates that are inherently difficult to predict and are necessarily speculative in nature, and we cannot assure you that we will achieve expected, or any, cost savings in connection with an acquisition. In addition, we cannot assure you that unforeseen factors will not offset the estimated cost savings or other benefits from our acquisitions. As a result, anticipated benefits could be delayed, differ significantly from our estimates and the other information contained in this report, or not be realized.Acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges.Our acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:•Adverse effects on our reported operating results due to charges to earnings, including impairment charges associated with goodwill and other intangibles;•Diversion of management attention from core business operations;•Integration of technology, operations, personnel and financial and other systems;•Increased expenses;•Increased foreign operations, often with unique issues relating to corporate culture, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and other challenges;•Assumption of known and unknown liabilities and exposure to litigation;•Increased levels of debt or dilution to existing stockholders; and•Potential disputes with the sellers of acquired businesses.We conduct operational, financial, tax, and legal due diligence on all acquisitions; however, we cannot assure that all potential risks or liabilities are adequately discovered, disclosed, or understood in each instance.In addition, internal controls over financial reporting of acquired companies may not be compliant with required standards. Issues may exist that could rise to the level of significant deficiencies or, in some cases, material weaknesses, particularly with respect to foreign companies or non-public U.S. companies.Our integration activities may place substantial demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. Customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business, technology, service or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.Dispositions or liabilities retained in connection with dispositions could negatively affect us.Our dispositions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from running our core businesses, increased expense associated with the dispositions, potential disputes with the customers or suppliers of the disposed businesses, potential disputes with the acquirers of the disposed businesses and a potential dilutive effect on our earnings per share. In addition, we have agreed to retain certain liabilities in connection with the disposition of certain businesses, including the Balcke Dürr business. These liabilities may be significant and could negatively impact our business.If dispositions are not completed in a timely manner, there may be a negative effect on our cash flows and/or our ability to execute our strategy. In addition, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of our dispositions. See “Business,” “MD&A - Results of Discontinued Operations,” and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for the status of our divestitures.9Our technology is important to our success, and failure to develop new products may result in a significant competitive disadvantage.We believe the development of our intellectual property rights is critical to the success of our business. In order to maintain our market positions and margins, we need to continually develop and introduce high-quality, technologically advanced and cost-effective products on a timely basis, in many cases in multiple jurisdictions around the world. The failure to do so could result in a significant competitive disadvantage.Governmental laws and regulations could negatively affect our business.Changes in laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject could have a significant negative impact on our business. In addition, we could face material costs and risks if it is determined that we have failed to comply with relevant law and regulation. We are subject to U.S. Customs and Export Regulations, including U.S. International Traffic and Arms Regulations and similar laws, which collectively control import, export and sale of technologies by companies and various other aspects of the operation of our business; the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws, which prohibit companies from making improper payments to government officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business; the California Transparency in Supply Chain Act and similar laws and regulations, which relate to human trafficking and anti-slavery and impose new compliance requirements on our businesses and their suppliers; and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and the European General Data Protection Regulation, which establish data management requirements for the protection of personal information of individuals. While our policies and procedures mandate compliance with such laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees and agents will always act in strict compliance. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations may result in civil and criminal enforcement, including monetary fines and possible injunctions against shipment of product or other of our activities, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Several of our businesses are reliant on or may be directly impacted by government regulations. Changes to these regulations may have a significant negative impact on these businesses. For example, (i) a reduction of Federal Aviation Administration regulations mandating lighting of towers and buildings at height; (ii) increases in Department of Energy regulations on energy efficiency requirements for heating, and (iii) a reduction in regulations requiring 811 calls to be made before the commencement of a digging project, could have a significant negative impact on these businesses. While we monitor these regulations and our businesses plan for potential changes, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt in each circumstance. Failure to adapt if regulations change could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Difficulties presented by domestic economic, political, legal, accounting and business factors could negatively affect our business.In 2018, approximately 86% of our revenues were generated inside the United States. Our reliance on U.S. revenues and U.S. manufacturing bases exposes us to a number of risks, including:•Government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions such as antidumping duties, as well as the imposition of trade sanctions by the United States against a class of products imported from or sold and exported to, or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with, countries in which we conduct business, could significantly increase our cost of products imported into or exported from the United States or reduce our sales and harm our business and the relaxation of embargoes and foreign trade restrictions, including antidumping duties on transformers, by the United States could adversely affect the market for our products in the United States;•Customs and tariffs may make it difficult or impossible for us to move our products or assets across borders in a cost-effective manner and may increase the cost of our raw materials, including raw materials sourced domestically;•Transportation and shipping expenses add cost to our products;•Complications related to shipping, including delays due to weather, labor action, or customs, may impact our profit margins or lead to lost business;•Environmental and other laws and regulations could increase our costs or limit our ability to run our business; and•Our ability to obtain supplies from foreign vendors and ship products internationally may be impaired during times of crisis or otherwise.Any of the above factors or other factors affecting the movement of people and products into and from various countries to North America could have a significant negative effect on our operations. In addition, our concentration on U.S. business may make it difficult to enter new markets, making it more difficult for our businesses to grow.10Worldwide economic conditions could negatively impact our businesses.Many of our customers historically have tended to delay capital projects, including expensive maintenance and upgrades, during economic downturns. Poor macroeconomic conditions could negatively impact our businesses by adversely affecting, among other things, our: •Revenues;•Margins;•Profits;•Cash flows;•Customers’ orders, including order cancellation activity or delays on existing orders;•Customers’ ability to access credit;•Customers’ ability to pay amounts due to us; and•Suppliers’ and distributors’ ability to perform and the availability and costs of materials and subcontracted services.Downturns in global economies could negatively impact our performance or any expectations in reporting performance. Our non-U.S. revenues and operations expose us to numerous risks that may negatively impact our business.To the extent we generate revenues outside of the United States, non-U.S. revenues and non-U.S. manufacturing bases exposes us to a number of risks, including:•Significant competition could come from local or long-term participants in non-U.S. markets who may have significantly greater market knowledge and substantially greater resources than we do;•Local customers may have a preference for locally-produced products;•Credit risk or financial condition of local customers and distributors could affect our ability to market our products or collect receivables;•Regulatory or political systems or barriers may make it difficult or impossible to enter or remain in new markets. In addition, these barriers may impact our existing businesses, including making it more difficult for them to grow;•Local political, economic and social conditions, including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions, political instability, nationalization of private enterprises, or unexpected changes relating to currency could adversely impact our revenues and operations;•The United Kingdom’s decision to exit from the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) has contributed to, and may continue to contribute to, economic, currency, market and regulatory uncertainty in the United Kingdom and European Union and could adversely affect economic, currency, market, regulatory, or political conditions both in those regions and worldwide;•Customs, tariffs and trade restrictions may make it difficult or impossible for us to move our products or assets across borders in a cost-effective manner;•Transportation and shipping expenses add cost to our products;•Complications related to shipping, including delays due to weather, labor action, or customs, may impact our profit margins or lead to lost business;•Local, regional or worldwide hostilities could impact our operations; and•Distance and language and cultural differences may make it more difficult to manage our business and employees and to effectively market our products and services.Any of the above factors or other factors affecting social and economic activity in the United Kingdom, China, and South Africa or affecting the movement of people and products into and from these countries to our major markets, could have a significant negative effect on our operations.Our customers have been and could be impacted by commodity availability and prices. A number of factors outside our control, including fluctuating commodity prices, impact the demand for our products. Increased commodity prices, including as a result of new or increased tariffs or the impact of new trade laws, may increase our customers’ cost of doing business, thus causing them to delay or cancel large capital projects.On the other hand, declining commodity prices may cause our customers to delay or cancel projects relating to the production of such commodities. Reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity, which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. Reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in the relevant market.11We may not be able to finance future needs or adapt our business plan to react to changes in economic or business conditions because of restrictions placed on us by our senior credit facilities and any existing or future instruments governing our other indebtedness.Our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain, or future or revised instruments may contain, various restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied. We also must comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests. Our subsidiaries may also be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us. In addition, our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain or may contain additional affirmative and negative covenants. Material existing restrictions are described more fully in the MD&A and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. Each of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities, such as acquisitions.If we do not comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness, we could default under those agreements, and the debt, together with accrued interest, could be declared due and payable. If we default under our senior credit facilities, the lenders could cause all our outstanding debt obligations under our senior credit facilities to become due and payable or require us to repay the indebtedness under these facilities. If our debt is accelerated, we may not be able to repay or refinance our debt. In addition, any default under our senior credit facilities or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. If the indebtedness under our senior credit facilities is accelerated, we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due under our senior credit facilities or other debt securities then outstanding. Our ability to comply with these provisions of our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness will be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control. Complying with our covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to us and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete, including against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.Our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.At December 31, 2018, we had $381.8 in total indebtedness. On that same date, we had $311.6 of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities, after giving effect to $32.0 reserved for outstanding letters of credit and $6.4 of borrowings under the revolving credit agreement, and $27.0 of available borrowing capacity under our trade receivables financing arrangement. In addition, at December 31, 2018, we had $30.1 of available issuance capacity under our foreign credit instrument facilities after giving effect to $119.9 reserved for outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2018, our cash and equivalents balance was $68.8. See MD&A and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance, or assumed in connection with, acquisitions. We may renegotiate or refinance our senior credit facilities or other debt facilities, or enter into additional agreements that have different or more stringent terms. The level of our indebtedness could:•Impact our ability to obtain new, or refinance existing, indebtedness, on favorable terms or at all;•Limit our ability to obtain, or obtain on favorable terms, additional debt financing for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions;•Limit our flexibility in reacting to competitive and other changes in the industry and economic conditions;•Limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock in the future;•Coupled with a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows due to economic developments or adverse developments in our business, make it difficult to meet debt service requirements; and•Expose us to interest rate fluctuations to the extent existing borrowings are, and any new borrowings may be, at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expense and interest payments in the event of increases in interest rates.Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal or pay interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors beyond our control. In addition, we cannot assure you that future borrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, whether in the ordinary course of business or upon an acceleration of such indebtedness, we may pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, revising implementation of or delaying strategic plans or seeking additional equity capital. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. In addition, we cannot assure that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements, or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements.12Numerous banks in many countries are syndicate members in our credit facility. Failure of one or more of our larger lenders, or several of our smaller lenders, could significantly reduce availability of our credit, which could harm our liquidity.The loss of key personnel and an inability to attract and retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations.We are dependent on the continued services of our leadership team. The loss of these personnel without adequate replacement could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience in many locations in order to operate our business successfully. From time to time, there may be a shortage of skilled labor, which may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain qualified employees. If we were unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals or our costs to do so were to increase significantly, our operations could be materially adversely affected.Currency conversion risk could have a material impact on our reported results of business operations. Our operating results are presented in U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in which we conduct business could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into U.S. dollars.Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, including countries utilizing the Euro, which may have a material adverse effect on sales or require us to lower our prices, and also decrease our reported revenues or margins related to sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent we are unable or determine not to increase local currency prices. Likewise, the increased strength of the U.S. dollar could allow competitors with foreign-based manufacturing costs to sell their products in the U.S. at lower prices. Alternatively, decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased overseas.Similarly, increased or decreased strength of the currencies of non-U.S. countries in which we manufacture will have a comparable effect against the currencies of other jurisdictions in which we sell. For example, our Radiodetection business manufactures a number of detection instruments in the United Kingdom and sells to customers in other countries, therefore increased strength of the British pound sterling will increase the effective price of these products sold in British pound sterling into other countries; and decreased strength of British pound sterling could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased outside of the United Kingdom.Credit and counterparty risks could harm our business.The financial condition of our customers and distributors could affect our ability to market our products or collect receivables. In addition, financial difficulties faced by our customers may lead to cancellations or delays of orders.Our customers may suffer financial difficulties that make them unable to pay for a project when completed, or they may decide not or be unable to pay us, either as a matter of corporate decision-making or in response to changes in local laws and regulations. We cannot assure you that expenses or losses for uncollectible amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.We operate in highly competitive markets. Our failure to compete effectively could harm our business. We sell our products in highly competitive markets, which could result in pressure on our profit margins and limit our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products. We compete on a number of fronts, including on the basis of product offerings, technical capabilities, quality, service and pricing. We have a number of competitors with substantial technological and financial resources, brand recognition and established relationships with global service providers. Some of our competitors have lower cost structures, support from local governments, or both. In addition, new competitors may enter the markets in which we participate. Competitors may be able to offer lower prices, additional products or services or a more attractive mix of products or services, or services or other incentives that we cannot or will not match. These competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new or emerging technologies and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns and make more attractive offers to potential customers, employees and strategic partners. In addition, competitive environments in slow-growth markets, to which some of our businesses have exposure, have been inherently more influenced by pricing and domestic and global economic conditions. To remain competitive, we need to invest in manufacturing, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. No assurances can be made that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make the investment required to maintain or increase our market share or that our investments will be successful. If we do not compete successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.13Changes in tax laws and regulations or other factors could cause our income tax obligations to increase, potentially reducing our net income and adversely affecting our cash flows.We are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions around the world. In preparing our financial statements, we provide for income taxes based on current tax laws and regulations and the estimated taxable income within each of these jurisdictions. Our income tax obligations, however, may be higher due to numerous factors, including changes in tax laws or regulations and the outcome of audits and examinations of our tax returns.Officials in some of the jurisdictions in which we do business have proposed, or announced that they are reviewing, tax changes that could potentially increase taxes, and other revenue-raising laws and regulations, including those that may be enacted as a result of the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project. Any such changes in tax laws or regulations could impose new restrictions, costs or prohibitions on existing practices as well as reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows.On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was enacted which significantly changed United States (“U.S.”) income tax law for businesses and individuals. The Act introduced changes that impacted U.S. corporate tax rates (e.g., a reduction in the top tax rate from 35% to 21%), business-related exclusions, and deductions and credits. The Act also has tax consequences for many entities that operate internationally, including the timing and the amount of tax to be paid on undistributed foreign earnings. Certain aspects of the Act are unclear and, thus, we anticipate subsequent regulations and interpretations to be issued that will provide additional guidance around application of the Act. The additional guidance could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.There is a risk that we could be challenged by tax authorities on certain of the tax positions we have taken, or will take, on our tax returns. Although we believe that current tax laws and regulations support our positions, there can be no assurance that tax authorities will agree with our positions. In the event tax authorities were to challenge one or more of our tax positions, an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. If the fair value of any of our reporting units is insufficient to recover the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangibles of the respective reporting unit, a material non-cash charge to earnings could result.At December 31, 2018, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net, of $592.8. We conduct annual impairment testing to determine if we will be able to recover all or a portion of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. In addition, we review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment more frequently if impairment indicators arise. If the fair value is insufficient to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, we may be required to record a material non-cash charge to earnings.The fair values of our reporting units generally are based on discounted cash flow projections that are believed to be reasonable under current and forecasted circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of the reported net assets of our reporting units. Other considerations are also incorporated, including comparable price multiples. Many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets that they serve. Accordingly, we consider estimates and judgments that affect the future cash flow projections, including principal methods of competition such as volume, price, service, product performance and technical innovations and estimates associated with cost reduction initiatives, capacity utilization, and assumptions for inflation and foreign currency changes. We monitor impairment indicators across all of our businesses. Significant changes in market conditions and estimates or judgments used to determine expected future cash flows that indicate a reduction in carrying value may give, and have given, rise to impairments in the period that the change becomes known.Cost reduction actions may affect our business.Cost reduction actions often result in charges against earnings. These charges can vary significantly from period to period and, as a result, we may experience fluctuations in our reported net income and earnings per share due to the timing of restructuring actions.Our current and planned products may contain defects or errors that are detected only after delivery to customers. If that occurs, our reputation may be harmed and we may face additional costs.We cannot assure you that our product development, manufacturing and integration testing will be adequate to detect all defects, errors, failures and quality issues that could impact customer satisfaction or result in claims against us with regard to our products. As a result, we may have, and from time to time have had, to replace certain components and/or provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects in products that are shipped. The occurrence of any defects, errors, failures or quality issues could result in cancellation of orders, product returns, diversion of our resources, legal actions by our customers or our customers’ 14end users and other losses to us or to any of our customers or end users, and could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and loss of sales, which would harm our business and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.Changes in key estimates and assumptions related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, such as discount rates, assumed long-term return on assets, assumed long-term trends of future cost, and accounting and legislative changes, as well as actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and other actuarial factors, could affect our results of operations and cash flows.We have defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, including both qualified and non-qualified plans, which cover a portion of our salaried and hourly employees and retirees, including a portion of our employees and retirees in foreign countries. As of December 31, 2018, our net liability to these plans was $150.7. The determination of funding requirements and pension expense or income associated with these plans involves significant judgment, particularly with respect to discount rates, long-term trends of future costs and other actuarial assumptions. If our assumptions change significantly due to changes in economic, legislative and/or demographic experience or circumstances, our pension and other benefit plans’ expense, funded status and our required cash contributions to such plans could be negatively impacted. In addition, returns on plan assets could have a material impact on our pension plans’ expense, funded status and our required contributions to the plans. Changes in regulations or law could also significantly impact our obligations. For example, see “MD&A - Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates” for the impact that changes in certain assumptions used in the calculation of our costs and obligations associated with these plans could have on our results of operations and financial position.We are subject to work stoppages, union negotiations, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force, which may adversely impact our operations and cause us to incur incremental costs.At December 31, 2018, we had six domestic collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 1,000 of our over 4,000 employees. Two of these collective bargaining agreements expire in 2019 and are scheduled for negotiation and renewal. We also have various collective labor arrangements covering certain non-U.S. employee groups. We are subject to potential union campaigns, work stoppages, union negotiations and other potential labor disputes. Further, we may be subject to work stoppages, which are beyond our control, at our suppliers or customers.Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company, and accordingly, we may not consummate a transaction that our stockholders consider favorable.Provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws may inhibit changes in control of our company not approved by our Board. These provisions include, for example: a staggered board of directors; a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent; a requirement that special stockholder meetings be called only by our Chairman, President or Board; advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations; limitations on stockholders’ ability to amend, alter or repeal the By-laws; enhanced voting requirements for certain business combinations involving substantial stockholders; the authority of our Board to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with terms determined in its discretion; and limitations on stockholders’ ability to remove directors. In addition, we are afforded the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could have similar effects. In general, Section 203 prohibits us from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” (each as defined in Section 203) for at least three years after the time the person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met. These protective provisions could result in our not consummating a transaction that our stockholders consider favorable or discourage entities from attempting to acquire us, potentially at a significant premium to our then-existing stock price.Increases in the number of shares of our outstanding common stock could adversely affect our common stock price or dilute our earnings per share.Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock into the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. As of December 31, 2018, we had the ability to issue up to an additional 1.683 shares as restricted stock shares, restricted stock units, performance stock units, or stock options under our 2002 Stock Compensation Plan, as amended in 2006, 2011, 2012, 2015, and 2017, and our 2006 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Incentive Plan. We also may issue a significant number of additional shares, in connection with acquisitions, through a registration statement, or otherwise. Additional shares issued would have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share.The Spin-Off of SPX FLOW could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders.In connection with the Spin-Off of SPX FLOW we received opinions of tax counsel satisfactory to us as to the tax-free treatment of the Spin-Off and certain related transactions. However, if the factual assumptions or representations upon which the opinions are based are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, we will not be able to rely on the opinions. Furthermore, 15the opinions are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or the courts. Accordingly, the IRS may challenge the conclusions set forth in the opinions and any such challenge could prevail. If, notwithstanding the opinions, the Spin-Off or a related transaction is determined to be taxable, we could be subject to a substantial tax liability. In addition, if the Spin-Off is determined to be taxable, each holder of our common stock who received shares of SPX FLOW would generally be treated as having received a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received.The Spin-Off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements.The Spin-Off is subject to review under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. Fraudulent conveyance laws generally provide that an entity engages in a constructive fraudulent conveyance when (1) the entity transfers assets and does not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in return, and (2) the entity (a) is insolvent at the time of the transfer or is rendered insolvent by the transfer, (b) has unreasonably small capital with which to carry on its business, or (c) intends to incur or believes it will incur debts beyond its ability to repay its debts as they mature. An unpaid creditor or an entity acting on behalf of a creditor (including, without limitation, a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy by us or SPX FLOW or any of our respective subsidiaries) may bring a lawsuit alleging that the Spin-Off or any of the related transactions constituted a constructive fraudulent conveyance. If a court accepts these allegations, it could impose a number of remedies, including, without limitation, voiding the distribution and returning SPX FLOW’s assets or SPX FLOW’s shares and subject us to liability.The measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws will vary depending on which jurisdiction’s law is applied. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if (1) the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (including contingent liabilities); (2) the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than its probable liabilities on its debts as such debts become absolute and matured; (3) it cannot pay its debts and other liabilities (including contingent liabilities and other commitments) as they mature; or (4) it has unreasonably small capital for the business in which it is engaged. We cannot assure you what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that we, SPX FLOW or any of our respective subsidiaries were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the Spin-Off.The distribution of SPX FLOW common stock is also subject to review under state corporate distribution statutes. Under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”), a corporation may only pay dividends to its stockholders either (1) out of its surplus (net assets) or (2) if there is no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year.Although we believe that we and SPX FLOW were each solvent at the time of the Spin-Off (including immediately after the distribution of shares of SPX FLOW common stock), that we are able to repay our debts as they mature and have sufficient capital to carry on our businesses, and that the distribution was made entirely out of surplus in accordance with Section 170 of the DGCL, we cannot assure you that a court would reach the same conclusions in determining whether SPX FLOW or we were insolvent at the time of, or after giving effect to, the Spin-Off, or whether lawful funds were available for the separation and the distribution to our stockholders.16"
4,SPXC,SPX CORP,2018-02-21,"ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
(All currency and share amounts are in millions)You should consider the risks described below and elsewhere in our documents filed with the SEC before investing in any of our securities. We may amend, supplement or add to the risk factors described below from time to time in future reports filed with the SEC.Many of the markets in which we operate are cyclical or are subject to industry events, and our results have been and could be affected as a result.Many of the markets in which we operate are subject to general economic cycles or industry events. In addition, certain of our businesses are subject to market-specific cycles and weather-related fluctuations, including, but not limited to:•HVAC; and•Power transmission and distribution products.In addition, contract timing on large projects, including those relating to power transmission and distribution systems, communications technology, fare collection systems, process cooling systems and towers, and power generation equipment may cause significant fluctuations in revenues and profits from period to period.The businesses of many of our customers, particularly general industrial and power and energy companies, are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced, and may continue to experience, periodic downturns. Cyclical changes and specific industry events could also affect sales of products in our other businesses. Downturns in the business cycles of our different operations may occur at the same time, which could exacerbate any adverse effects on our business. In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal and weather-related fluctuations. Historically, many of our key businesses generally have tended to have stronger performance in the second half of the year. See ""MD&A - Results of Continuing Operations and Results Reportable Segments.""Our business depends on capital investment and maintenance expenditures by our customers.Demand for most of our products and services depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by our customers. The level of capital expenditures by our customers fluctuates based on planned expansions, new builds and repairs, commodity prices, general economic conditions, availability of credit, and expectations of future market behavior. Any of these factors, whether individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, in turn, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The price and availability of raw materials may adversely affect our business.We are exposed to a variety of risks relating to the price and availability of raw materials. In recent years, we have faced volatility in the prices of many key raw materials, including copper, steel and oil. Increases in the prices of raw materials or shortages or allocations of materials may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as we may not be able to pass cost increases on to our customers, or our sales may be reduced. We are subject to, or may enter into, long-term supplier contracts that may increase our exposure to pricing fluctuations.Our customers could be impacted by commodity availability and prices.A number of factors outside our control, including fluctuating commodity prices, impact the demand for our products. Increased commodity prices may increase our customers’ cost of doing business, thus causing them to delay or cancel large capital projects.On the other hand, declining commodity prices may cause our customers to delay or cancel projects relating to the production of such commodities. For example, declines in oil prices have led to reduced demand for certain of our power generation products. In addition, in regions where the economy is largely dependent on oil and gas, declines in oil and gas prices have impacted the ability of our customers in these regions to finance capital expenditures. As a result, certain of our customers in these regions have delayed or cancelled tenders for our spectrum monitoring and related products. Reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing 6orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity, which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. Reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in the relevant market.Credit and counterparty risks could harm our business.The financial condition of our customers and distributors could affect our ability to market our products or collect receivables. In addition, financial difficulties faced by our customers may lead to cancellations or delays of orders.Our customers may suffer financial difficulties that make them unable to pay for a project when completed, or they may decide not or be unable to pay us, either as a matter of corporate decision-making or in response to changes in local laws and regulations. We cannot assure you that expenses or losses for uncollectible amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.We operate in highly competitive markets. Our failure to compete effectively could harm our business.We sell our products in highly competitive markets, which could result in pressure on our profit margins and limit our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products. We compete on a number of fronts, including on the basis of product offerings, technical capabilities, quality, service and pricing. We have a number of competitors with substantial technological and financial resources, brand recognition and established relationships with global service providers. Some of our competitors have lower cost structures, support from local governments, or both. In addition, new competitors may enter the markets in which we participate. Competitors may be able to offer lower prices, additional products or services or a more attractive mix of products or services, or services or other incentives that we cannot or will not match. These competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new or emerging technologies and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns and make more attractive offers to potential customers, employees and strategic partners. In addition, competitive environments in slow-growth markets, to which some of our businesses have exposure, have been inherently more influenced by pricing and domestic and global economic conditions. To remain competitive, we need to invest in manufacturing, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. No assurances can be made that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make the investment required to maintain or increase our market share or that our investments will be successful. If we do not compete successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.The fact that we outsource various elements of the products and services we sell subjects us to the business risks of our suppliers and subcontractors, which could have a material adverse impact on our operations.In areas where we depend on third-party suppliers and subcontractors for outsourced products, components or services, we are subject to the risk of customer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of the products or services we sell due to supplier or subcontractor failure. In addition, business difficulties experienced by a third-party supplier or subcontractor can lead to the interruption of our ability to obtain outsourced products or services and ultimately our inability to supply products or services to our customers. Third-party supplier and subcontractor business interruptions can include, but are not limited to, work stoppages, union negotiations and other labor disputes. Current economic conditions could also impact the ability of suppliers and subcontractors to access credit and, thus, impair their ability to provide us quality products or services in a timely manner, or at all.Cost overruns, inflation, delays and other risks could significantly impact our results, particularly with respect to long-term fixed-price contracts.A portion of our revenues and earnings is generated through fixed-price contracts, particularly within our Engineered Solutions reportable segment. We recognize revenues for certain of these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting whereby revenues and expenses, and thereby profit, in a given period are determined based on our estimates as to the project status and the costs remaining to complete a particular project.Estimates of total revenues and cost at completion are subject to many variables, including the length of time to complete a contract. In addition, contract delays may negatively impact these estimates and our revenues and earnings results for affected periods.To the extent that we underestimate the remaining cost to complete a project, we may overstate the revenues and profit in a particular period. Further, certain of these contracts provide for penalties or liquidated damages for failure to timely perform our obligations under the contract, or require that we, at our expense, correct and remedy to the satisfaction of the other party certain defects. Because some of our long-term contracts are at a fixed price, we 7face the risk that cost overruns or inflation may exceed, erode or eliminate our expected profit margin, or cause us to record a loss on our projects.Our large power projects in South Africa are an example of these types of long-term-contract-related risks. The business environment surrounding our large power projects in South Africa remains difficult, as we have experienced, cost over-runs, and various other challenges associated with a complex set of contractual relationships among the end customer, prime contractors, various subcontractors (including us and our subcontractors), and various suppliers.  We are currently involved in a number of claim disputes relating to these challenges.  We are pursuing various commercial alternatives for addressing these challenges, in attempt to mitigate our overall financial exposure.  Although we believe that our current estimates of revenues and costs relating to our long-term contracts are reasonable, it is possible that future revisions of such estimates could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.Worldwide economic conditions could negatively impact our businesses.Many of our customers historically have tended to delay large capital projects, including expensive maintenance and upgrades, during economic downturns. Poor macroeconomic conditions could negatively impact our businesses by adversely affecting, among other things, our:•Revenues;•Margins;•Profits;•Cash flows;•Customers’ orders, including order cancellation activity or delays on existing orders;•Customers’ ability to access credit;•Customers’ ability to pay amounts due to us; and•Suppliers’ and distributors’ ability to perform and the availability and costs of materials and subcontracted services.Downturns in global economies could negatively impact our performance or any expectations in reporting performance. For example, economic downturns relating to lower oil and gas prices have impacted the ability of customers in countries with oil and gas dependent economies to finance certain capital projects. This, in turn, has reduced demand for certain of our spectrum monitoring and related products in these regions.Failure to protect or unauthorized use of our intellectual property may harm our business.Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology or knowledge, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as in the United States. Costs incurred to defend our rights may be material.If we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted.We are increasingly dependent on cloud-based and other information technology (“IT”) networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information. We depend on such IT infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and between our personnel and suppliers and customers. In addition, we rely on these IT systems to record, process, summarize, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including, among other things, our accounting and financial reporting processes; our manufacturing and supply chain processes; our sales and marketing efforts; and the data related to our research and development efforts. The failure of our IT systems or those of our business partners or third-party service providers to perform properly, or difficulties encountered in the development of new systems or the upgrade of existing systems, could disrupt our business and harm our reputation, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess or obsolete inventory, and product shortages, causing our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results to suffer. Upon expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third-party vendors, we may not be able to replace the services provided to us in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable to us, and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete.8Information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cyber-attacks may be random, coordinated, or targeted, including sophisticated computer crime threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, and those of our business partners and third-party service providers, and to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. Despite our implementation of security measures, cybersecurity threats, such as malicious software, phishing attacks, computer viruses, and attempts to gain unauthorized access, cannot be completely mitigated. Our business, reputation, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if, as a result of a significant cyber event or otherwise, our operations are disrupted or shutdown; our confidential, proprietary information is stolen or disclosed; the performance or security of our cloud-based product offerings is impacted; our intranet and internet sites are compromised; data is manipulated or destroyed; we incur costs or are required to pay fines in connection with stolen customer, employee, or other confidential information; we must dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection; or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs. Currency conversion risk could have a material impact on our reported results of business operations.Our operating results are presented in U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in which we conduct business could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into U.S. dollars.Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, including countries utilizing the Euro, which may have a material adverse effect on sales or require us to lower our prices, and also decrease our reported revenues or margins related to sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent we are unable or determine not to increase local currency prices. Likewise, decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased overseas.         Similarly, increased or decreased strength of the currencies of non-U.S. countries in which we manufacture will have a comparable effect against the currencies of other jurisdictions in which we sell. For example, our Radiodetection business manufactures a number of detection instruments in the United Kingdom and sells to customers in other countries, therefore increased strength of the British pound sterling will increase the effective price of these products sold in British pound sterling into other countries; and decreased strength of British pound sterling could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased outside of the United Kingdom.We are subject to laws, regulations and potential liability relating to claims, complaints and proceedings, including those relating to environmental, product liability and other matters.We are subject to various laws, ordinances, regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the United States and other nations. With respect to acquisitions, divestitures and continuing operations, we may acquire or retain liabilities of which we are not aware, or which are of a different character or magnitude than expected. Additionally, changes in laws, ordinances, regulations, or other governmental policies may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities.We face environmental exposures including, for example, those relating to discharges from and materials handled as part of our operations, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by petroleum products or hazardous substances or wastes, and the health and safety of our employees. We may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal, or remediation of hazardous substances or petroleum products on, under, or in our current or formerly owned or leased properties, or from third-party disposal facilities that we may have used, without regard to whether we knew of, or caused, the presence of the contaminants. The presence of, or failure to properly remediate, these substances may have adverse effects, including, for example, substantial investigative or remedial obligations and limitations on the ability to sell or rent affected property or to borrow funds using affected property as collateral. New or existing environmental matters or changes in environmental laws or policies could lead to material costs for environmental compliance or cleanup. In addition, environmentally related product regulations are growing globally in number and complexity and could contribute to increased costs with respect to disclosure requirements, product sales and distribution related costs, and post-sale recycling and disposal costs. There can be no assurance that these liabilities and costs will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Numerous claims, complaints, and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business have been asserted or are pending against us or certain of our subsidiaries (collectively, “claims”). These claims relate to litigation matters (e.g., class actions and contracts, intellectual property, and competitive claims), environmental matters, product liability matters (predominately associated with alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials), and other risk management matters (e.g., general liability, automobile, and workers’ compensation claims). Periodically, claims, 9complaints and proceedings arising other than in the ordinary course of business have been asserted or are pending against us or certain of our subsidiaries (e.g. patent infringement and disputes with subsidiary shareholder(s)).  From time to time, we face actions by governmental authorities, both in and outside the United States. Additionally, we may become subject to other claims of which we are currently unaware, which may be significant, or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring significantly greater loss than we anticipate. Our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable (e.g., because of insurer insolvency) to protect us against potential loss exposures.We devote significant time and expense to defend against the various claims, complaints, and proceedings brought against us, and we cannot assure you that the expenses or distractions from operating our businesses arising from these defenses will not increase materially.We cannot assure you that our accruals and right to indemnity and insurance will be sufficient, that recoveries from insurance or indemnification claims will be available or that any of our current or future claims or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.See “MD&A - Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates - Contingent Liabilities” and Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Our failure to successfully complete acquisitions could negatively affect us.We may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions, which could materially impact our growth rate, results of operations, future cash flows and stock price. Our ability to achieve our goals depends upon, among other things, our ability to identify and successfully acquire companies, businesses and product lines, to effectively integrate them and to achieve cost savings. We may also be unable to raise additional funds necessary to consummate these acquisitions. In addition, decreases in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to consummate acquisitions. Competition for acquisitions in our business areas may be significant and result in higher prices for businesses, including businesses that we may target, which may also affect our acquisition rate or benefits achieved from our acquisitions.We may not achieve the expected cost savings and other benefits of our acquisitions.We strive for and expect to achieve cost savings in connection with our acquisitions, including: (i) manufacturing process and supply chain rationalization, (ii) streamlining redundant administrative overhead and support activities, and (iii) restructuring and repositioning sales and marketing organizations to eliminate redundancies. Cost savings expectations are estimates that are inherently difficult to predict and are necessarily speculative in nature, and we cannot assure you that we will achieve expected, or any, cost savings in connection with an acquisition. In addition, we cannot assure you that unforeseen factors will not offset the estimated cost savings or other benefits from our acquisitions. As a result, anticipated benefits could be delayed, differ significantly from our estimates and the other information contained in this report, or not be realized.Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could have a negative effect on our operations; our acquisitions could cause financial difficulties.Our acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:•Adverse effects on our reported operating results due to charges to earnings, including impairment charges associated with goodwill and other intangibles;•Diversion of management attention from core business operations;•Integration of technology, operations, personnel and financial and other systems;•Increased expenses;•Increased foreign operations, often with unique issues relating to corporate culture, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and other challenges;•Assumption of known and unknown liabilities and exposure to litigation;•Increased levels of debt or dilution to existing stockholders; and•Potential disputes with the sellers of acquired businesses, technology, services or products.In addition, internal controls over financial reporting of acquired companies may not be compliant with required standards. Issues may exist that could rise to the level of significant deficiencies or, in some cases, material weaknesses, particularly with respect to foreign companies or non-public U.S. companies.10Our integration activities may place substantial demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. Customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business, technology, service or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.Dispositions or liabilities retained in connection with dispositions could negatively affect us.Our dispositions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from running our core businesses, increased expense associated with the dispositions, potential disputes with the customers or suppliers of the disposed businesses, potential disputes with the acquirers of the disposed businesses and a potential dilutive effect on our earnings per share. In addition, we have agreed to retain certain liabilities in connection with the disposition of certain businesses, including the Balcke Dürr business. These liabilities may be significant and could negatively impact our business.If dispositions are not completed in a timely manner, there may be a negative effect on our cash flows and/or our ability to execute our strategy. In addition, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of our dispositions. See “Business,” “MD&A - Results of Discontinued Operations,” and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for the status of our divestitures.Governmental laws and regulations could negatively affect our business.Changes in laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject could have a significant negative impact on our business. In addition, we could face material costs and risks if it is determined that we have failed to comply with relevant law and regulation. We are subject to U.S. Customs and Export Regulations, including U.S. International Traffic and Arms Regulations and similar laws, which collectively control import, export and sale of technologies by companies and various other aspects of the operation of our business; the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws, which prohibit companies from making improper payments to government officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business; and the California Transparency in Supply Chain Act and similar laws and regulations, which relate to human trafficking and anti-slavery and impose new compliance requirements on our businesses and their suppliers. While our policies and procedures mandate compliance with such laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees and agents will always act in strict compliance. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations may result in civil and criminal enforcement, including monetary fines and possible injunctions against shipment of product or other of our activities, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Changes in tax laws and regulations or other factors could cause our income tax obligations to increase, potentially reducing our net income and adversely affecting our cash flows.We are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions around the world. In preparing our financial statements, we provide for income taxes based on current tax laws and regulations and the estimated taxable income within each of these jurisdictions. Our income tax obligations, however, may be higher due to numerous factors, including changes in tax laws or regulations and the outcome of audits and examinations of our tax returns.Officials in some of the jurisdictions in which we do business have proposed, or announced that they are reviewing, tax changes that could potentially increase taxes, and other revenue-raising laws and regulations, including those that may be enacted as a result of the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project. Any such changes in tax laws or regulations could impose new restrictions, costs or prohibitions on existing practices as well as reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows.On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was enacted which significantly changes United States (“U.S.”) income tax law for businesses and individuals. The Act introduces changes that impact U.S. corporate tax rates (e.g., a reduction in the top tax rate from 35% to 21%), business-related exclusions, and deductions and credits. The Act also will have tax consequences for many entities that operate internationally, including the timing and the amount of tax to be paid on undistributed foreign earnings. We have recorded provisional amounts in our 2017 consolidated financial statements to reflect the impact of the Act, as we have yet to complete our analysis of the impact (see Notes 1 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details). The results of our analysis, which we will complete in 2018, could have a material impact on our 2018 financial position and results of operations.  In addition, certain aspects of the Act are unclear and, thus, we anticipate subsequent regulations and interpretations to be issued that will provide additional guidance around application of the Act. The additional guidance could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.   11There is a risk that we could be challenged by tax authorities on certain of the tax positions we have taken, or will take, on our tax returns.  Although we believe that current tax laws and regulations support our positions, there can be no assurance that tax authorities will agree with our positions.  In the event tax authorities were to challenge one or more of our tax positions, an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The loss of key personnel and an inability to attract and retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations.We are dependent on the continued services of our leadership team. The loss of these personnel without adequate replacement could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience in many locations in order to operate our business successfully. From time to time, there may be a shortage of skilled labor, which may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain qualified employees. If we were unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals or our costs to do so were to increase significantly, our operations could be materially adversely affected.Our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.At December 31, 2017, we had $356.8 in total indebtedness. On that same date, we had $314.3 of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities, after giving effect to $35.7 reserved for outstanding letters of credit, and $33.3 of available borrowing capacity under our trade receivables financing arrangement. In addition, at December 31, 2017, we had $16.9 of available issuance capacity under our foreign credit instrument facilities after giving effect to $183.1 reserved for outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2017, our cash and equivalents balance was $124.3. See MD&A and Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance, or assumed in connection with, acquisitions. We may renegotiate or refinance our senior credit facilities or other debt facilities, or enter into additional agreements that have different or more stringent terms. The level of our indebtedness could:•Impact our ability to obtain new, or refinance existing, indebtedness, on favorable terms or at all;•Limit our ability to obtain, or obtain on favorable terms, additional debt financing for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions;•Limit our flexibility in reacting to competitive and other changes in the industry and economic conditions;•Limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock in the future;•Coupled with a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows due to economic developments or adverse developments in our business, make it difficult to meet debt service requirements; and•Expose us to interest rate fluctuations to the extent existing borrowings are, and any new borrowings may be, at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expense and interest payments in the event of increases in interest rates.Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal or pay interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors beyond our control. In addition, we cannot assure you that future borrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, whether in the ordinary course of business or upon an acceleration of such indebtedness, we may pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, revising implementation of or delaying strategic plans or seeking additional equity capital. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. In addition, we cannot assure that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements, or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements.Numerous banks in many countries are syndicate members in our credit facility. Failure of one or more of our larger lenders, or several of our smaller lenders, could significantly reduce availability of our credit, which could harm our liquidity.12We may not be able to finance future needs or adapt our business plan to react to changes in economic or business conditions because of restrictions placed on us by our senior credit facilities and any existing or future instruments governing our other indebtedness.Our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain, or future or revised instruments may contain, various restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied. We also must comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests. Our subsidiaries may also be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us. In addition, our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain or may contain additional affirmative and negative covenants. Material existing restrictions are described more fully in the MD&A and Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements. Each of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities, such as acquisitions.If we do not comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness, we could default under those agreements, and the debt, together with accrued interest, could be declared due and payable. If we default under our senior credit facilities, the lenders could cause all our outstanding debt obligations under our senior credit facilities to become due and payable or require us to repay the indebtedness under these facilities. If our debt is accelerated, we may not be able to repay or refinance our debt. In addition, any default under our senior credit facilities or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. If the indebtedness under our senior credit facilities is accelerated, we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due under our senior credit facilities or other debt securities then outstanding. Our ability to comply with these provisions of our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness will be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control. Complying with our covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to us and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete, including against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.Difficulties presented by economic, political, legal, accounting and business factors could negatively affect our business.In 2017, approximately 87% of our revenues were generated inside the United States. Our reliance on U.S. revenues and U.S. manufacturing bases exposes us to a number of risks, including:•Government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions such as anti-dumping duties, as well as the imposition of trade sanctions by the United States against a class of products imported from or sold and exported to, or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with, countries in which we conduct business, could significantly increase our cost of products imported into or exported from the United States or reduce our sales and harm our business;•Customs and tariffs may make it difficult or impossible for us to move our products or assets across borders in a cost-effective manner;•Transportation and shipping expenses add cost to our products;•Complications related to shipping, including delays due to weather, labor action, or customs, may impact our profit margins or lead to lost business;•Environmental and other laws and regulations could increase our costs or limit our ability to run our business; and•Our ability to obtain supplies from foreign vendors and ship products internationally may be impaired during times of crisis or otherwise.Any of the above factors or other factors affecting the movement of people and products into and from various countries to North America could have a significant negative effect on our operations. In addition, our concentration on U.S. business may make it difficult to enter new markets, making it more difficult for our businesses to grow.Our non-U.S. revenues and operations expose us to numerous risks that may negatively impact our business.To the extent we generate revenues outside of the United States, non-U.S. revenues and non-U.S. manufacturing bases exposes us to a number of risks, including:•Significant competition could come from local or long-term participants in non-U.S. markets who may have significantly greater market knowledge and substantially greater resources than we do;•Local customers may have a preference for locally-produced products;13•Credit risk or financial condition of local customers and distributors could affect our ability to market our products or collect receivables;•Regulatory or political systems or barriers may make it difficult or impossible to enter or remain in new markets. In addition, these barriers may impact our existing businesses, including making it more difficult for them to grow;•Local political, economic and social conditions, including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions, political instability, nationalization of private enterprises, or unexpected changes relating to currency could adversely impact our revenues and operations;•The United Kingdom’s decision to exit from the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) has contributed to, and may continue to contribute to, European economic, market and regulatory uncertainty and could adversely affect European or worldwide economic, market, regulatory, or political conditions;•Customs and tariffs may make it difficult or impossible for us to move our products or assets across borders in a cost-effective manner;•Transportation and shipping expenses add cost to our products;•Complications related to shipping, including delays due to weather, labor action, or customs, may impact our profit margins or lead to lost business;•Local, regional or worldwide hostilities could impact our operations; and•Distance and language and cultural differences may make it more difficult to manage our business and employees and to effectively market our products and services.Any of the above factors or other factors affecting social and economic activity in the United Kingdom, China, and South Africa or affecting the movement of people and products into and from these countries to our major markets, could have a significant negative effect on our operations.If the fair value of any of our reporting units is insufficient to recover the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangibles of the respective reporting unit, a material non-cash charge to earnings could result.At December 31, 2017, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net, of $463.5. We conduct annual impairment testing to determine if we will be able to recover all or a portion of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. In addition, we review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment more frequently if impairment indicators arise. If the fair value is insufficient to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, we may be required to record a material non-cash charge to earnings.The fair values of our reporting units generally are based on discounted cash flow projections that are believed to be reasonable under current and forecasted circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of the reported net assets of our reporting units. Other considerations are also incorporated, including comparable price multiples. Many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets that they serve. Accordingly, we consider estimates and judgments that affect the future cash flow projections, including principal methods of competition such as volume, price, service, product performance and technical innovations and estimates associated with cost reduction initiatives, capacity utilization, and assumptions for inflation and foreign currency changes. We monitor impairment indicators across all of our businesses. Significant changes in market conditions and estimates or judgments used to determine expected future cash flows that indicate a reduction in carrying value may give, and have given, rise to impairments in the period that the change becomes known.Cost reduction actions may affect our business.Cost reduction actions often result in charges against earnings. These charges can vary significantly from period to period and, as a result, we may experience fluctuations in our reported net income and earnings per share due to the timing of restructuring actions.Our technology is important to our success, and failure to develop new products may result in a significant competitive disadvantage.We believe the development of our intellectual property rights is critical to the success of our business. In order to maintain our market positions and margins, we need to continually develop and introduce high-quality, technologically advanced and cost-effective products on a timely basis, in many cases in multiple jurisdictions around the world. The failure to do so could result in a significant competitive disadvantage.14Our current and planned products may contain defects or errors that are detected only after delivery to customers. If that occurs, our reputation may be harmed and we may face additional costs.We cannot assure you that our product development, manufacturing and integration testing will be adequate to detect all defects, errors, failures and quality issues that could impact customer satisfaction or result in claims against us with regard to our products. As a result, we may have, and from time to time have had, to replace certain components and/or provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects in products that are shipped. The occurrence of any defects, errors, failures or quality issues could result in cancellation of orders, product returns, diversion of our resources, legal actions by our customers or our customers’ end users and other losses to us or to any of our customers or end users, and could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and loss of sales, which would harm our business and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.Changes in key estimates and assumptions related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, such as discount rates, assumed long-term return on assets, assumed long-term trends of future cost, and accounting and legislative changes, as well as actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and other actuarial factors, could affect our results of operations and cash flows.We have defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, including both qualified and non-qualified plans, which cover a portion of our salaried and hourly employees and retirees, including a portion of our employees and retirees in foreign countries. As of December 31, 2017, our net liability to these plans was $156.8. The determination of funding requirements and pension expense or income associated with these plans involves significant judgment, particularly with respect to discount rates, long-term trends of future costs and other actuarial assumptions. If our assumptions change significantly due to changes in economic, legislative and/or demographic experience or circumstances, our pension and other benefit plans’ expense, funded status and our required cash contributions to such plans could be negatively impacted. In addition, returns on plan assets could have a material impact on our pension plans’ expense, funded status and our required contributions to the plans. Changes in regulations or law could also significantly impact our obligations. For example, see “MD&A - Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates” for the impact that changes in certain assumptions used in the calculation of our costs and obligations associated with these plans could have on our results of operations and financial position.We are subject to work stoppages, union negotiations, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force, which may adversely impact our operations and cause us to incur incremental costs.At December 31, 2017, we had six domestic collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 1,000 of our approximately 5,000 employees. Two of these collective bargaining agreements expire in 2018 and are scheduled for negotiation and renewal. We also have various collective labor arrangements covering certain non-U.S. employee groups. We are subject to potential union campaigns, work stoppages, union negotiations and other potential labor disputes. Further, we may be subject to work stoppages, which are beyond our control, at our suppliers or customers.Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company, and accordingly, we may not consummate a transaction that our stockholders consider favorable.Provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws may inhibit changes in control of our company not approved by our Board. These provisions include, for example: a staggered board of directors; a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent; a requirement that special stockholder meetings be called only by our Chairman, President or Board; advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations; limitations on stockholders’ ability to amend, alter or repeal the By-laws; enhanced voting requirements for certain business combinations involving substantial stockholders; the authority of our Board to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with terms determined in its discretion; and limitations on stockholders’ ability to remove directors. In addition, we are afforded the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could have similar effects. In general, Section 203 prohibits us from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” (each as defined in Section 203) for at least three years after the time the person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met. These protective provisions could result in our not consummating a transaction that our stockholders consider favorable or discourage entities from attempting to acquire us, potentially at a significant premium to our then-existing stock price.15Increases in the number of shares of our outstanding common stock could adversely affect our common stock price or dilute our earnings per share.Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock into the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. As of December 31, 2017, we had the ability to issue up to an additional 1.682 shares as restricted stock shares, restricted stock units, performance stock units, or stock options under our 2002 Stock Compensation Plan, as amended in 2006, 2011, 2012, 2015, and 2017, and our 2006 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Incentive Plan. We also may issue a significant number of additional shares, in connection with acquisitions, through a registration statement, or otherwise. Additional shares issued would have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share.Risks Related to our Spin-Off of SPX FLOWThe Spin-Off of SPX FLOW could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders.In connection with the Spin-Off of SPX FLOW we received opinions of tax counsel satisfactory to us as to the tax-free treatment of the Spin-Off and certain related transactions. However, if the factual assumptions or representations upon which the opinions are based are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, we will not be able to rely on the opinions. Furthermore, the opinions are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or the courts. Accordingly, the IRS may challenge the conclusions set forth in the opinions and any such challenge could prevail. If, notwithstanding the opinions, the Spin-Off or a related transaction is determined to be taxable, we could be subject to a substantial tax liability. In addition, if the Spin-Off is determined to be taxable, each holder of our common stock who received shares of SPX FLOW would generally be treated as having received a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received.The Spin-Off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements.The Spin-Off is subject to review under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. Fraudulent conveyance laws generally provide that an entity engages in a constructive fraudulent conveyance when (1) the entity transfers assets and does not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in return, and (2) the entity (a) is insolvent at the time of the transfer or is rendered insolvent by the transfer, (b) has unreasonably small capital with which to carry on its business, or (c) intends to incur or believes it will incur debts beyond its ability to repay its debts as they mature. An unpaid creditor or an entity acting on behalf of a creditor (including, without limitation, a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy by us or SPX FLOW or any of our respective subsidiaries) may bring a lawsuit alleging that the Spin-Off or any of the related transactions constituted a constructive fraudulent conveyance. If a court accepts these allegations, it could impose a number of remedies, including, without limitation, voiding the distribution and returning SPX FLOW’s assets or SPX FLOW’s shares and subject us to liability.The measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws will vary depending on which jurisdiction’s law is applied. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if (1) the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (including contingent liabilities); (2) the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than its probable liabilities on its debts as such debts become absolute and matured; (3) it cannot pay its debts and other liabilities (including contingent liabilities and other commitments) as they mature; or (4) it has unreasonably small capital for the business in which it is engaged. We cannot assure you what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that we, SPX FLOW or any of our respective subsidiaries were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the Spin-Off.The distribution of SPX FLOW common stock is also subject to review under state corporate distribution statutes. Under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”), a corporation may only pay dividends to its stockholders either (1) out of its surplus (net assets) or (2) if there is no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year.Although we believe that we and SPX FLOW were each solvent at the time of the Spin-Off (including immediately after the distribution of shares of SPX FLOW common stock), that we are able to repay our debts as they mature and have sufficient capital to carry on our businesses, and that the distribution was made entirely out of surplus in accordance with Section 170 of the DGCL, we cannot assure you that a court would reach the same conclusions in determining whether SPX FLOW or we were insolvent at the time of, or after giving effect to, the Spin-Off, or whether lawful funds were available for the separation and the distribution to our stockholders.16"
6,SPXC,SPX CORP,2017-02-24,"ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
(All currency and share amounts are in millions)You should consider the risks described below and elsewhere in our documents filed with the SEC before investing in any of our securities. We may amend, supplement or add to the risk factors described below from time to time in future reports filed with the SEC.Many of the markets in which we operate are cyclical or are subject to industry events, and our results have been and could be affected as a result.Many of the markets in which we operate are subject to general economic cycles or industry events. In addition, certain of our businesses are subject to market-specific cycles and weather-related fluctuations, including, but not limited to:•HVAC; and•Power transmission and distribution products.In addition, contract timing on large projects, including those relating to power transmission and distribution systems, communications technology, fare collection systems, process cooling systems and towers, and power generation equipment may cause significant fluctuations in revenues and profits from period to period.The businesses of many of our customers, particularly general industrial and power and energy companies, are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced, and may continue to experience, periodic downturns. Cyclical changes and specific industry events could also affect sales of products in our other businesses. Downturns in the business cycles of our different operations may occur at the same time, which could exacerbate any adverse effects on our business. In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal and weather-related fluctuations. Historically, many of our key businesses generally have tended to have stronger performance in the second half of the year. See ""MD&A - Results of Reportable Segments.""Our business depends on capital investment and maintenance expenditures by our customers.Demand for most of our products and services depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by our customers. The level of capital expenditures by our customers fluctuates based on planned expansions, new builds and repairs, commodity prices, general economic conditions, availability of credit, and expectations of future market behavior. Any of these factors, whether individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, in turn, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The price and availability of raw materials may adversely affect our business.We are exposed to a variety of risks relating to the price and availability of raw materials. In recent years, we have faced volatility in the prices of many key raw materials, including copper, steel and oil. Increases in the prices of raw materials or shortages or allocations of materials may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as we may not be able to pass cost increases on to our customers, or our sales may be reduced. We are subject to, or may enter into, long-term supplier contracts that may increase our exposure to pricing fluctuations.Our customers could be impacted by commodity availability and prices.A number of factors outside our control, including fluctuating commodity prices, impact the demand for our products. Increased commodity prices may increase our customers’ cost of doing business, thus causing them to delay or cancel large capital projects.On the other hand, declining commodity prices may cause our customers to delay or cancel projects relating to the production of such commodities. For example, declines in oil prices have led to reduced demand for certain of our power generation products. In addition, in regions where the economy is largely dependent on oil and gas, declines in oil and gas prices have impacted the ability of our customers in these regions to finance capital expenditures. As a result, certain of our customers in these regions have delayed or cancelled tenders for our spectrum monitoring and related products. Reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing 6orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity, which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. Reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in the relevant market.Credit and counterparty risks could harm our business.The financial condition of our customers and distributors could affect our ability to market our products or collect receivables. In addition, financial difficulties faced by our customers may lead to cancellations or delays of orders.Our customers may suffer financial difficulties that make them unable to pay for a project when completed, or they may decide not or be unable to pay us, either as a matter of corporate decision-making or in response to changes in local laws and regulations. We cannot assure you that expenses or losses for uncollectible amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.We operate in highly competitive markets. Our failure to compete effectively could harm our business.We sell our products in highly competitive markets, which could result in pressure on our profit margins and limit our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products. We compete on a number of fronts, including on the basis of product offerings, technical capabilities, quality, service and pricing. We have a number of competitors with substantial technological and financial resources, brand recognition and established relationships with global service providers. Some of our competitors have lower cost structures, support from local governments, or both. In addition, new competitors may enter the markets in which we participate. Competitors may be able to offer lower prices, additional products or services or a more attractive mix of products or services, or services or other incentives that we cannot or will not match. These competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new or emerging technologies and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns and make more attractive offers to potential customers, employees and strategic partners. In addition, competitive environments in slow-growth markets, to which some of our businesses have exposure, have been inherently more influenced by pricing and domestic and global economic conditions. To remain competitive, we need to invest in manufacturing, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. No assurances can be made that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make the investment required to maintain or increase our market share or that our investments will be successful. If we do not compete successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.The fact that we outsource various elements of the products and services we sell subjects us to the business risks of our suppliers and subcontractors, which could have a material adverse impact on our operations.In areas where we depend on third-party suppliers and subcontractors for outsourced products, components or services, we are subject to the risk of customer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of the products or services we sell due to supplier or subcontractor failure. In addition, business difficulties experienced by a third-party supplier or subcontractor can lead to the interruption of our ability to obtain outsourced products or services and ultimately our inability to supply products or services to our customers. Third-party supplier and subcontractor business interruptions can include, but are not limited to, work stoppages, union negotiations and other labor disputes. Current economic conditions could also impact the ability of suppliers and subcontractors to access credit and, thus, impair their ability to provide us quality products or services in a timely manner, or at all. Cost overruns, inflation, delays and other risks could significantly impact our results, particularly with respect to long-term fixed-price contracts. A portion of our revenues and earnings is generated through long-term fixed-price contracts, particularly for the process cooling systems and heat exchangers sold by our Engineered Solutions segment. We recognize revenues for certain of these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting whereby revenues and expenses, and thereby profit, in a given period are determined based on our estimates as to the project status and the costs remaining to complete a particular project.Estimates of total revenues and cost at completion are subject to many variables, including the length of time to complete a contract. In addition, contract delays may negatively impact these estimates and our revenues and earnings results for affected periods.To the extent that we underestimate the remaining cost to complete a project, we may overstate the revenues and profit in a particular period. Further, certain of these contracts provide for penalties or liquidated damages for failure to timely perform our obligations under the contract, or require that we, at our expense, correct and remedy to 7the satisfaction of the other party certain defects. Because some of our long-term contracts are at a fixed price, we face the risk that cost overruns or inflation may exceed, erode or eliminate our expected profit margin, or cause us to record a loss on our projects.Our large power projects in South Africa are an example of these types of long-term-contract-related risks. These projects, which have experienced significant delays from their initial target completion dates, involve a complex set of contractual relationships among the end customer, the prime contractors, and the various subcontractors and suppliers. Although we believe that our current estimates of costs relating to these projects are reasonable, we cannot assure you that additional costs will not arise as these projects are completed.Worldwide economic conditions could negatively impact our businesses.Many of our customers historically have tended to delay large capital projects, including expensive maintenance and upgrades, during economic downturns. Poor macroeconomic conditions could negatively impact our businesses by adversely affecting, among other things, our:•Revenues;•Margins;•Profits;•Cash flows;•Customers’ orders, including order cancellation activity or delays on existing orders;•Customers’ ability to access credit;•Customers’ ability to pay amounts due to us; and•Suppliers’ and distributors’ ability to perform and the availability and costs of materials and subcontracted services.Downturns in global economies could negatively impact our performance or any expectations in reporting performance. For example, economic downturns relating to lower oil and gas prices have impacted the ability of customers in countries with oil and gas dependent economies to finance certain capital projects. This, in turn, has reduced demand for certain of our spectrum monitoring and related products in these regions.Failure to protect or unauthorized use of our intellectual property may harm our business.Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology or knowledge, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as in the United States. Costs incurred to defend our rights may be material.If we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted.We are increasingly dependent on cloud-based and other information technology (“IT”) networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information. We depend on such IT infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and between our personnel and suppliers and customers. In addition, we rely on these IT systems to record, process, summarize, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including, among other things, our accounting and financial reporting processes; our manufacturing and supply chain processes; our sales and marketing efforts; and the data related to our research and development efforts. The failure of our IT systems or those of our business partners or third-party service providers to perform properly, or difficulties encountered in the development of new systems or the upgrade of existing systems, could disrupt our business and harm our reputation, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess or obsolete inventory, and product shortages, causing our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results to suffer. Upon expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third-party vendors, we may not be able to replace the services provided to us in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable to us, and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete.Despite our implementation of security measures, cybersecurity threats, such as malicious software, phishing attacks, computer viruses and attempts to gain unauthorized access, cannot be completely mitigated. Security breaches of our, our customers’ and our vendors’ IT infrastructure can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including our intellectual property, trade secrets, customer information or other 8confidential business information. Likewise, data privacy breaches by employees and others with both permitted and unauthorized access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public, or may be permanently lost. Accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access by third parties of our facilities, our information systems or the systems of our cloud-based or other service providers, or the existence of computer viruses or malware in our or their data or software, could expose us to a risk of information loss and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information, including information relating to our customers and the personal information of our employees. If we or our third-party service providers fail to keep customers’ proprietary information and documentation confidential, we may lose existing customers and potential new customers and may expose them to significant loss of revenue based on the premature release of confidential information.Information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cyber-attacks may be random, coordinated, or targeted, including sophisticated computer crime threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, and those of our business partners and third-party service providers, and to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. Our business, reputation, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if, as a result of a significant cyber event or otherwise, our operations are disrupted or shutdown; our confidential, proprietary information is stolen or disclosed; the performance or security of our cloud-based product offerings is impacted; our intranet and internet sites are compromised; data is manipulated or destroyed; we incur costs or are required to pay fines in connection with stolen customer, employee, or other confidential information; we must dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection; or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs.Currency conversion risk could have a material impact on our reported results of business operations.Our operating results are presented in U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in which we conduct business could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into U.S. dollars. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, including countries utilizing the Euro, which may have a material adverse effect on sales or require us to lower our prices, and also decrease our reported revenues or margins related to sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent we are unable or determine not to increase local currency prices. Likewise, decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased overseas.         Similarly, increased or decreased strength of the currencies of non-U.S. countries in which we manufacture will have a comparable effect against the currencies of other jurisdictions in which we sell. For example, our Radiodetection business manufactures a number of detection instruments in the United Kingdom and sells to customers in other countries, therefore increased strength of the British pound sterling will increase the effective price of these products sold in British pound sterling into other countries; and decreased strength of British pound sterling could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased outside of the United Kingdom.We are subject to laws, regulations and potential liability relating to claims, complaints and proceedings, including those relating to environmental, product liability and other matters.We are subject to various laws, ordinances, regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the United States and other nations. With respect to acquisitions, divestitures and continuing operations, we may acquire or retain liabilities of which we are not aware, or which are of a different character or magnitude than expected. Additionally, changes in laws, ordinances, regulations or other governmental policies may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities.We face environmental exposures including, for example, those relating to discharges from and materials handled as part of our operations, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by petroleum products or hazardous substances or wastes, and the health and safety of our employees. We may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances or petroleum products on, under, or in our current or formerly owned or leased properties, or from third-party disposal facilities that we may have used, without regard to whether we knew of, or caused, the presence of the contaminants. The presence of, or failure to properly remediate, these substances may have adverse effects, including, for example, substantial investigative or remedial obligations and limitations on the ability to sell or rent affected property or to borrow funds using affected property as collateral. New or existing environmental matters or changes in environmental laws or policies could lead to material costs for environmental compliance or cleanup. In addition, environmentally related product regulations are growing globally in number and complexity and could contribute to increased costs with respect to disclosure requirements, product sales and 9distribution related costs, and post-sale recycling and disposal costs. There can be no assurance that these liabilities and costs will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Numerous claims, complaints and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business have been asserted or are pending against us or certain of our subsidiaries (collectively, “claims”). These claims relate to litigation matters (e.g., class actions, derivative lawsuits and contracts, intellectual property, and competitive claims), environmental matters, product liability matters (predominately associated with alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials), and other risk management matters (e.g., general liability, automobile, and workers’ compensation claims). Periodically, claims, complaints and proceedings arising other than in the ordinary course of business have been asserted or are pending against us or certain of our subsidiaries (e.g. patent infringement and disputes with subsidiary shareholder(s)).  From time to time, we face actions by governmental authorities, both in and outside the United States. Additionally, we may become subject to other claims of which we are currently unaware, which may be significant, or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring significantly greater loss than we anticipate. Our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable (e.g., because of insurer insolvency) to protect us against potential loss exposures.We devote significant time and expense to defend against the various claims, complaints and proceedings brought against us, and we cannot assure you that the expenses or distractions from operating our businesses arising from these defenses will not increase materially.We cannot assure you that our accruals and right to indemnity and insurance will be sufficient, that recoveries from insurance or indemnification claims will be available or that any of our current or future claims or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.See “MD&A - Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates - Contingent Liabilities” and Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.Governmental laws and regulations could negatively affect our business.Changes in laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject could have a significant negative impact on our business. In addition, we could face material costs and risks if it is determined that we have failed to comply with relevant law and regulation. We are subject to U.S. Customs and Export Regulations, including U.S. International Traffic and Arms Regulations and similar laws, which collectively control import, export and sale of technologies by companies and various other aspects of the operation of our business; the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws, which prohibit companies from making improper payments to government officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business; and the California Transparency in Supply Chain Act and similar laws and regulations, which relate to human trafficking and anti-slavery and impose new compliance requirements on our businesses and their suppliers. While our policies and procedures mandate compliance with such laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees and agents will always act in strict compliance. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations may result in civil and criminal enforcement, including monetary fines and possible injunctions against shipment of product or other of our activities, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Additionally, laws and regulations have increasingly focused on supply chain transparency. As part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC has promulgated disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals (tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold), which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, known as conflict minerals. Certain of our products contain gold, tungsten and tin. As a result, we must annually publicly disclose whether we manufacture any products that contain conflict minerals. Additionally, customers typically rely on us to provide critical data regarding the parts they purchase, including conflict mineral information. Our material sourcing is broad-based and multi-tiered, and it is difficult to verify the origins for conflict minerals used in the products we sell. We have many suppliers and each may provide conflict mineral information in a different manner, if at all. Accordingly, because the supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges from being unable to sufficiently verify the origins of conflict minerals used in our products.Changes in tax laws and regulations or other factors could cause our effective income tax rate to increase, potentially reducing our net income and adversely affecting our cash flows.We are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions around the world. In preparing our financial statements, we calculate our effective income tax rate based on current tax laws and regulations and the estimated taxable income within each of these jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rate, however, may be higher due to numerous factors, 10including changes in tax laws or regulations. An effective income tax rate significantly higher than our expectations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity.Officials in some of the jurisdictions in which we do business have proposed, or announced that they are reviewing, tax changes that could potentially increase taxes, and other revenue-raising laws and regulations, including those that may be enacted as a result of the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project. Additionally, comprehensive U.S. tax reform has been publically stated to be a priority for the U.S. Congress. Changes in U.S. tax laws, if adopted, or changes in tax law interpretation could, depending on the nature of the changes, adversely affect our effective tax rates and our results. Any such changes in tax laws or regulations could impose new restrictions, costs or prohibitions on existing practices as well as reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows.The loss of key personnel and an inability to attract and retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations.We are dependent on the continued services of our leadership team. The loss of these personnel without adequate replacement could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience in many locations in order to operate our business successfully. From time to time, there may be a shortage of skilled labor, which may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain qualified employees. If we were unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals or our costs to do so were to increase significantly, our operations could be materially adversely affected.Our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.At December 31, 2016, we had $356.2 in total indebtedness. On that same date, we had $313.9 of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities, after giving effect to $36.1 reserved for outstanding letters of credit, and $39.9 of available borrowing capacity under our trade receivables financing arrangement. In addition, at December 31, 2016, we had $98.6 of available issuance capacity under our foreign credit instrument facilities after giving effect to $201.4 reserved for outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2016, our cash and equivalents balance was $99.6. See MD&A and Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance, or assumed in connection with, acquisitions. We may renegotiate or refinance our senior credit facilities or other debt facilities, or enter into additional agreements that have different or more stringent terms. The level of our indebtedness could:•Impact our ability to obtain new, or refinance existing, indebtedness, on favorable terms or at all; •Limit our ability to obtain, or obtain on favorable terms, additional debt financing for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions; •Limit our flexibility in reacting to competitive and other changes in the industry and economic conditions; •Limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock in the future; •Coupled with a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows due to economic developments or adverse developments in our business, make it difficult to meet debt service requirements; and •Expose us to interest rate fluctuations to the extent existing borrowings are, and any new borrowings may be, at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expense and interest payments in the event of increases in interest rates. Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal or pay interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors beyond our control. In addition, we cannot assure you that future borrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, whether in the ordinary course of business or upon an acceleration of such indebtedness, we may pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, revising implementation of or delaying strategic plans or seeking additional equity capital. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. In addition, we cannot assure that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements, or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements. Numerous banks in many countries are syndicate members in our credit facility. Failure of one or more of our larger lenders, or several of our smaller lenders, could significantly reduce availability of our credit, which could harm our liquidity.11We may not be able to finance future needs or adapt our business plan to react to changes in economic or business conditions because of restrictions placed on us by our senior credit facilities and any existing or future instruments governing our other indebtedness.Our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain, or future or revised instruments may contain, various restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied. We also must comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests. Our subsidiaries may also be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us. In addition, our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain or may contain additional affirmative and negative covenants. Material existing restrictions are described more fully in the MD&A and Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements. Each of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities, such as acquisitions.If we do not comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness, we could default under those agreements, and the debt, together with accrued interest, could be declared due and payable. If we default under our senior credit facilities, the lenders could cause all our outstanding debt obligations under our senior credit facilities to become due and payable or require us to repay the indebtedness under these facilities. If our debt is accelerated, we may not be able to repay or refinance our debt. In addition, any default under our senior credit facilities or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. If the indebtedness under our senior credit facilities is accelerated, we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due under our senior credit facilities or other debt securities then outstanding. Our ability to comply with these provisions of our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness will be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control. Complying with our covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to us and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete, including against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.Our failure to successfully complete acquisitions could negatively affect us.We may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions, which could materially impact our growth rate, results of operations, future cash flows and stock price. Our ability to achieve our goals depends upon, among other things, our ability to identify and successfully acquire companies, businesses and product lines, to effectively integrate them and to achieve cost savings. We may also be unable to raise additional funds necessary to consummate these acquisitions. In addition, decreases in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to consummate acquisitions. Competition for acquisitions in our business areas may be significant and result in higher prices for businesses, including businesses that we may target, which may also affect our acquisition rate or benefits achieved from our acquisitions.We may not achieve the expected cost savings and other benefits of our acquisitions.We strive for and expect to achieve cost savings in connection with our acquisitions, including: (i) manufacturing process and supply chain rationalization, (ii) streamlining redundant administrative overhead and support activities, and (iii) restructuring and repositioning sales and marketing organizations to eliminate redundancies. Cost savings expectations are estimates that are inherently difficult to predict and are necessarily speculative in nature, and we cannot assure you that we will achieve expected, or any, cost savings. In addition, we cannot assure you that unforeseen factors will not offset the estimated cost savings or other benefits from our acquisitions. As a result, anticipated benefits could be delayed, differ significantly from our estimates and the other information contained in this report, or not be realized.Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could have a negative effect on our operations; our acquisitions could cause financial difficulties.Our acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:•Adverse effects on our reported operating results due to charges to earnings, including impairment charges associated with goodwill and other intangibles;•Diversion of management attention from core business operations;•Integration of technology, operations, personnel and financial and other systems;•Increased expenses;•Increased foreign operations, often with unique issues relating to corporate culture, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and other challenges;12•Assumption of known and unknown liabilities and exposure to litigation;•Increased levels of debt or dilution to existing stockholders; and•Potential disputes with the sellers of acquired businesses, technology, services or products.In addition, internal controls over financial reporting of acquired companies may not be compliant with required standards. Issues may exist that could rise to the level of significant deficiencies or, in some cases, material weaknesses, particularly with respect to foreign companies or non-public U.S. companies.Our integration activities may place substantial demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. Customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business, technology, service or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.Dispositions or liabilities retained in connection with dispositions could negatively affect us.Our dispositions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from running our core businesses, increased expense associated with the dispositions, potential disputes with the customers or suppliers of the disposed businesses, potential disputes with the acquirers of the disposed businesses and a potential dilutive effect on our earnings per share. In addition, we have agreed to retain certain liabilities in connection with the disposition of certain businesses, including the Balcke Dürr business. These liabilities may be significant and could negatively impact our business.If dispositions are not completed in a timely manner, there may be a negative effect on our cash flows and/or our ability to execute our strategy. In addition, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of our dispositions. See “Business,” “MD&A - Results of Discontinued Operations,” and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for the status of our divestitures.Difficulties presented by economic, political, legal, accounting and business factors could negatively affect our business.In 2016, approximately 84% of our revenues were generated inside the United States. Our reliance on U.S. revenues and U.S. manufacturing bases exposes us to a number of risks, including:•Government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions such as anti-dumping duties, as well as the imposition of trade sanctions by the United States against a class of products imported from or sold and exported to, or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with, countries in which we conduct business, could significantly increase our cost of products imported into or exported from the United States or reduce our sales and harm our business;•Customs and tariffs may make it difficult or impossible for us to move our products or assets across borders in a cost-effective manner;•Transportation and shipping expenses add cost to our products;•Complications related to shipping, including delays due to weather, labor action, or customs, may impact our profit margins or lead to lost business;•Environmental and other laws and regulations could increase our costs or limit our ability to run our business; and•Our ability to obtain supplies from foreign vendors and ship products internationally may be impaired during times of crisis or otherwise.Any of the above factors or other factors affecting the movement of people and products into and from various countries to North America could have a significant negative effect on our operations. In addition, our concentration on U.S. business may make it difficult to enter new markets, making it more difficult for our businesses to grow.Our non-U.S. revenues and operations expose us to numerous risks that may negatively impact our business.To the extent we generate revenues outside of the United States, non-U.S. revenues and non-U.S. manufacturing bases exposes us to a number of risks, including:•Significant competition could come from local or long-term participants in non-U.S. markets who may have significantly greater market knowledge and substantially greater resources than we do; 13•Failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws regulating trade, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other anti-corruption laws, could result in adverse consequences, including fines, criminal sanctions, or loss of access to markets;•Local customers may have a preference for locally-produced products; •Credit risk or financial condition of local customers and distributors could affect our ability to market our products or collect receivables; •Regulatory or political systems or barriers may make it difficult or impossible to enter or remain in new markets. In addition, these barriers may impact our existing businesses, including making it more difficult for them to grow; •Local political, economic and social conditions, including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions, political instability, nationalization of private enterprises, or unexpected changes relating to currency could adversely impact our revenues and operations; •The United Kingdom’s decision to exit from the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) has contributed to, and may continue to contribute to, European economic, market and regulatory uncertainty and could adversely affect European or worldwide economic, market, regulatory, or political conditions; •Customs and tariffs may make it difficult or impossible for us to move our products or assets across borders in a cost-effective manner; •Transportation and shipping expenses add cost to our products; •Complications related to shipping, including delays due to weather, labor action, or customs, may impact our profit margins or lead to lost business; •Local, regional or worldwide hostilities could impact our operations; and •Distance and language and cultural differences may make it more difficult to manage our business and employees and to effectively market our products and services.Any of the above factors or other factors affecting social and economic activity in the United Kingdom, China, and South Africa or affecting the movement of people and products into and from these countries to our major markets, could have a significant negative effect on our operations.Increases in the number of shares of our outstanding common stock could adversely affect our common stock price or dilute our earnings per share.Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock into the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. As of December 31, 2016, we had the ability to issue up to an additional 2.097 shares as restricted stock shares, restricted stock units, performance stock units, or stock options under our 2002 Stock Compensation Plan, as amended in 2006, 2011, 2012, 2015 and 2017, and our 2006 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Incentive Plan. We also may issue a significant number of additional shares, in connection with acquisitions, through a registration statement, or otherwise. Additional shares issued would have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share.If the fair value of any of our reporting units is insufficient to recover the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangibles of the respective reporting unit, a material non-cash charge to earnings could result.At December 31, 2016, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net, of $458.3. We conduct annual impairment testing to determine if we will be able to recover all or a portion of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. In addition, we review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment more frequently if impairment indicators arise. If the fair value is insufficient to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, we may be required to record a material non-cash charge to earnings.The fair values of our reporting units generally are based on discounted cash flow projections that are believed to be reasonable under current and forecasted circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of the reported net assets of our reporting units. Other considerations are also incorporated, including comparable price multiples. Many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets that they serve. Accordingly, we consider estimates and judgments that affect the future cash flow projections, including principal methods of competition such as volume, price, service, product performance and technical innovations and estimates associated with cost reduction initiatives, capacity utilization, and assumptions for inflation and foreign currency changes. We monitor impairment indicators across all of our businesses. Significant changes in market conditions and estimates or judgments used to determine expected future cash flows that indicate a reduction in carrying value may give, and have given, rise to impairments in the period that the change becomes known.14Cost reduction actions may affect our business.Cost reduction actions often result in charges against earnings. These charges can vary significantly from period to period and, as a result, we may experience fluctuations in our reported net income and earnings per share due to the timing of restructuring actions.Our technology is important to our success, and failure to develop new products may result in a significant competitive disadvantage.We believe the development of our intellectual property rights is critical to the success of our business. In order to maintain our market positions and margins, we need to continually develop and introduce high-quality, technologically advanced and cost-effective products on a timely basis, in many cases in multiple jurisdictions around the world. The failure to do so could result in a significant competitive disadvantage.Our current and planned products may contain defects or errors that are detected only after delivery to customers. If that occurs, our reputation may be harmed and we may face additional costs.We cannot assure you that our product development, manufacturing and integration testing will be adequate to detect all defects, errors, failures and quality issues that could impact customer satisfaction or result in claims against us with regard to our products. As a result, we may have, and from time to time have had, to replace certain components and/or provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects in products that are shipped. The occurrence of any defects, errors, failures or quality issues could result in cancellation of orders, product returns, diversion of our resources, legal actions by our customers or our customers’ end users and other losses to us or to any of our customers or end users, and could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and loss of sales, which would harm our business and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.Changes in key estimates and assumptions related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, such as discount rates, assumed long-term return on assets, assumed long-term trends of future cost, and accounting and legislative changes, as well as actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and other actuarial factors, could affect our results of operations and cash flows.We have defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, including both qualified and non-qualified plans, which cover a portion of our salaried and hourly employees and retirees, including a portion of our employees and retirees in foreign countries. As of December 31, 2016, our net liability to these plans was $195.8. The determination of funding requirements and pension expense or income associated with these plans involves significant judgment, particularly with respect to discount rates, long-term trends of future costs and other actuarial assumptions. If our assumptions change significantly due to changes in economic, legislative and/or demographic experience or circumstances, our pension and other benefit plans’ expense, funded status and our required cash contributions to such plans could be negatively impacted. In addition, returns on plan assets could have a material impact on our pension plans’ expense, funded status and our required contributions to the plans. Changes in regulations or law could also significantly impact our obligations. For example, see “MD&A - Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates” for the impact that changes in certain assumptions used in the calculation of our costs and obligations associated with these plans could have on our results of operations and financial position.We are subject to work stoppages, union negotiations, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force, which may adversely impact our operations and cause us to incur incremental costs.At December 31, 2016, we had over 5,000 employees. Six domestic collective bargaining agreements covered approximately 1,050 employees. We also had various collective labor arrangements as of that date covering certain non-U.S. employee groups. We are subject to potential union campaigns, work stoppages, union negotiations and other potential labor disputes. Further, we may be subject to work stoppages, which are beyond our control, at our suppliers or customers.Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company, and accordingly, we may not consummate a transaction that our stockholders consider favorable.Provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws may inhibit changes in control of our company not approved by our Board. These provisions include, for example: a staggered board of directors; a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent; a requirement that special stockholder meetings be called only by our Chairman, President or Board; advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations; limitations on 15stockholders’ ability to amend, alter or repeal the By-laws; enhanced voting requirements for certain business combinations involving substantial stockholders; the authority of our Board to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with terms determined in its discretion; and limitations on stockholders’ ability to remove directors. In addition, we are afforded the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could have similar effects. In general, Section 203 prohibits us from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” (each as defined in Section 203) for at least three years after the time the person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met. These protective provisions could result in our not consummating a transaction that our stockholders consider favorable or discourage entities from attempting to acquire us, potentially at a significant premium to our then-existing stock price.Risks Related to our Spin-Off of SPX FLOWThe Spin-Off of SPX FLOW could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders.In connection with the Spin-Off of SPX FLOW we received opinions of tax counsel satisfactory to us as to the tax-free treatment of the Spin-Off and certain related transactions. However, if the factual assumptions or representations upon which the opinions are based are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, we will not be able to rely on the opinions. Furthermore, the opinions are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or the courts. Accordingly, the IRS may challenge the conclusions set forth in the opinions and any such challenge could prevail. If, notwithstanding the opinions, the Spin-Off or a related transaction is determined to be taxable, we could be subject to a substantial tax liability. In addition, if the Spin-Off is determined to be taxable, each holder of our common stock who received shares of SPX FLOW would generally be treated as having received a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received.Even if the Spin-Off otherwise qualifies as a tax-free transaction, the distribution could be taxable to us (but not to our stockholders) in certain circumstances if future significant acquisitions of our stock or the stock of SPX FLOW are determined to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Spin-Off. In this event, the resulting tax liability would be substantial. In connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with SPX FLOW, under which SPX FLOW agreed (i) not to enter into any transaction without our consent that could cause the Spin-Off to be taxable to us, and (ii) to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from such a transaction. The indemnity from SPX FLOW may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities. Any tax liabilities resulting from the Spin-Off or related transactions could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The Spin-Off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements.The Spin-Off is subject to review under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. Fraudulent conveyance laws generally provide that an entity engages in a constructive fraudulent conveyance when (1) the entity transfers assets and does not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in return, and (2) the entity (a) is insolvent at the time of the transfer or is rendered insolvent by the transfer, (b) has unreasonably small capital with which to carry on its business, or (c) intends to incur or believes it will incur debts beyond its ability to repay its debts as they mature. An unpaid creditor or an entity acting on behalf of a creditor (including, without limitation, a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy by us or SPX FLOW or any of our respective subsidiaries) may bring a lawsuit alleging that the Spin-Off or any of the related transactions constituted a constructive fraudulent conveyance. If a court accepts these allegations, it could impose a number of remedies, including, without limitation, voiding the distribution and returning SPX FLOW’s assets or SPX FLOW’s shares and subject us to liability.The measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws will vary depending on which jurisdiction’s law is applied. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if (1) the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (including contingent liabilities); (2) the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than its probable liabilities on its debts as such debts become absolute and matured; (3) it cannot pay its debts and other liabilities (including contingent liabilities and other commitments) as they mature; or (4) it has unreasonably small capital for the business in which it is engaged. We cannot assure you what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that we, SPX FLOW or any of our respective subsidiaries were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the Spin-Off.The distribution of SPX FLOW common stock is also subject to review under state corporate distribution statutes. Under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”), a corporation may only pay dividends to 16its stockholders either (1) out of its surplus (net assets) or (2) if there is no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year.Although we believe that we and SPX FLOW were each solvent at the time of the Spin-Off (including immediately after the distribution of shares of SPX FLOW common stock), that we are able to repay our debts as they mature and have sufficient capital to carry on our businesses, and that the distribution was made entirely out of surplus in accordance with Section 170 of the DGCL, we cannot assure you that a court would reach the same conclusions in determining whether SPX FLOW or we were insolvent at the time of, or after giving effect to, the Spin-Off, or whether lawful funds were available for the separation and the distribution to our stockholders.17"
12,SPXC,SPX CORP,2016-02-26,"ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
(All currency and share amounts are in millions)You should consider the risks described below and elsewhere in our documents filed with the SEC before investing in any of our securities. We may amend, supplement or add to the risk factors described below from time to time in future reports filed with the SEC.Many of the markets in which we operate are cyclical or are subject to industry events, and our results have been and could be affected as a result.Many of the markets in which we operate are subject to general economic cycles or industry events. In addition, certain of our businesses are subject to market-specific cycles, including, but not limited to:•HVAC;•Power generation products; and•Power transmission and distribution products.In addition, contract timing on large projects, including those relating to power generation equipment, power transmission and distribution systems, communications technology, and cooling systems and towers, may cause significant fluctuations in revenues and profits from period to period.The businesses of many of our customers, particularly power and energy and general industrial companies, are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced, and may continue to experience, periodic downturns. Cyclical changes and specific industry events could also affect sales of products in our other businesses. Downturns in the business cycles of our different operations may occur at the same time, which could exacerbate any adverse effects on our business. See ""MD&A - Results of Reportable Segments."" In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal fluctuations. Historically, some of our key businesses generally tend to be stronger in the second half of the year.Cost overruns, inflation, delays and other risks could significantly impact our results, particularly with respect to long-term fixed-price contracts. A portion of our revenues and earnings is generated through long-term fixed-price contracts, particularly in our power generation businesses within our Power segment. We recognize revenues from certain of these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting whereby revenues and expenses, and thereby profit, in a given period are determined based on our estimates as to the project status and the costs remaining to complete a particular project.Estimates of total revenues and cost at completion are subject to many variables, including the length of time to complete a contract. In addition, contract delays may negatively impact these estimates and our revenues and earnings results for affected periods.To the extent that we underestimate the remaining cost to complete a project, we may overstate the revenues and profit in a particular period. Further, certain of these contracts provide for penalties or liquidated damages for failure to timely perform our obligations under the contract, or require that we, at our expense, correct and remedy to the satisfaction of the other party certain defects. Because some of our long-term contracts are at a fixed price, we face the risk that cost overruns or inflation may exceed, erode or eliminate our expected profit margin, or cause us to record a loss on our projects.Our large power projects in South Africa are an example of these types of long-term-contract-related risks. These projects, which have already experienced significant delays from their initial target completion dates, involve a complex set of contractual relationships among the end customer, the prime contractors, and the various subcontractors and suppliers. Although we believe that our current estimates of costs relating to these projects are reasonable, we cannot assure you that additional costs will not arise as these projects are completed.Our business depends on capital investment and maintenance expenditures by our customers.Demand for most of our products and services depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by our customers. The level of capital expenditures by our customers fluctuates based on planned expansions, new builds, and repairs, commodity prices, general economic conditions, availability of credit, and expectations of future market behavior. Any of these factors, whether individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, in turn, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.6Our customers could be impacted by commodity availability and prices.A number of factors outside our control, including fluctuating commodity prices, impact the demand for our products. Increased commodity prices may increase our customers' cost of doing business, thus causing them to delay or cancel large capital projects.On the other hand, declining commodity prices may cause our customers to delay or cancel projects relating to the production of such commodities. For example, recent declines in oil prices have led to reduced demand for certain of our power generation products. Reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity, which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. This reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in the relevant market.The price and availability of raw materials may adversely affect our business.We are exposed to a variety of risks relating to the price and availability of raw materials. In recent years, we have faced volatility in the prices of many of our key raw materials, including copper, steel and oil. Increases in the prices of raw materials or shortages or allocations of materials may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as we may not be able to pass cost increases on to our customers, or our sales may be reduced. We are subject to, or may enter into, long-term supplier contracts that may increase our exposure to pricing fluctuations.Credit and counterparty risks could harm our business.The financial condition of our customers and distributors could affect our ability to market our products or collect receivables. In addition, financial difficulties faced by our customers may lead to cancellations or delays of orders.Our customers may suffer financial difficulties that make them unable to pay for a project when completed, or they may decide not or be unable to pay us, either as a matter of corporate decision-making or in response to changes in local laws and regulations. We cannot assure you that expenses or losses for uncollectible amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.We operate in highly competitive markets. Our failure to compete effectively could harm our business.We sell our products in highly competitive markets, which could result in pressure on our profit margins and limit our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products. We compete on a number of fronts, including on the basis of product offerings, technical capabilities, quality, service and pricing. We have a number of competitors with substantial technological and financial resources, brand recognition and established relationships with global service providers. Some of our competitors have low cost structures, support from local governments, or both. In addition, new competitors may enter the markets in which we participate. Competitors may be able to offer lower prices, additional products or services or a more attractive mix of products or services, or services or other incentives that we cannot or will not match. These competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new or emerging technologies and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, and make more attractive offers to potential customers, employees and strategic partners. In addition, competitive environments in slow-growth markets, to which some of our businesses have exposure, have been inherently more influenced by pricing and domestic and global economic conditions. To remain competitive, we must invest in manufacturing, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. No assurances can be made that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make the investment required to maintain or increase our market share or that our investments will be successful. If we do not compete successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.The fact that we outsource various elements of the products and services we sell subjects us to the business risks of our suppliers and subcontractors, which could have a material adverse impact on our operations.In areas where we depend on third-party suppliers and subcontractors for outsourced products, components or services, we are subject to the risk of customer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of the products or services we sell due to supplier or subcontractor failure. In addition, business difficulties experienced by a third-party supplier or subcontractor can lead to the interruption of our ability to obtain outsourced products or services and ultimately our inability to supply products or services to our customers. Third-party supplier and subcontractor business interruptions can include, but are not limited to, work stoppages, union negotiations and other labor disputes. Current economic conditions could also impact the ability of suppliers and subcontractors to access credit and, thus, impair their ability to provide us quality products or services in a timely manner, or at all. 7Worldwide economic conditions could negatively impact our businesses.Many of our customers historically have tended to delay large capital projects, including expensive maintenance and upgrades, during economic downturns. Poor macroeconomic conditions could negatively impact our businesses by adversely affecting, among other things, our:•Revenues;•Margins;•Profits;•Cash flows;•Customers' orders, including order cancellation activity or delays on existing orders;•Customers' ability to access credit;•Customers' ability to pay amounts due to us; and•Suppliers' and distributors' ability to perform and the availability and costs of materials and subcontracted services.Recent downturns in global economies could negatively impact our performance or any expectations in reporting performance.Failure to protect or unauthorized use of our intellectual property may harm our business.Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology or knowledge, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as in the United States. Costs incurred to defend our rights may be material.If we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted.We are increasingly dependent on cloud-based and other information technology (""IT"") networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information. We depend on such IT infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and between our personnel and suppliers and customers. In addition, we rely on these IT systems to record, process, summarize, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including, among other things, our accounting and financial functions, including maintaining our internal controls; our manufacturing and supply chain processes; our sales and marketing efforts; and the data related to our research and development efforts. The failure of our IT systems or those of our business partners or third-party service providers to perform properly, or difficulties encountered in the development of new systems or the upgrade of existing systems, could disrupt our business and harm our reputation, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess or obsolete inventory, and product shortages, causing our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results to suffer. Upon expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third-party vendors, we may not be able to replace the services provided to us in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable to us, and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete.Despite our implementation of security measures, cybersecurity threats, such as malicious software, phishing attacks, computer viruses and attempts to gain unauthorized access, cannot be completely mitigated. Security breaches of our, our customers' and our vendors' IT infrastructure can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including our intellectual property, trade secrets, customer information or other confidential business information. Likewise, data privacy breaches by employees and others with both permitted and unauthorized access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public, or may be permanently lost. Accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access by third parties of our facilities, our information systems or the systems of our cloud-based or other service providers, or the existence of computer viruses or malware in our or their data or software, could expose us to a risk of information loss and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information, including information relating to our customers and the personal information of our employees. If we or our third-party service providers fail to keep customers’ proprietary information and documentation confidential, we may lose existing customers and potential new customers and may expose them to significant loss of revenue based on the premature release of confidential information.Information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cyber-attacks may be random, coordinated, or targeted, including sophisticated computer crime threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, and those of our business partners and third- party service providers, and to 8the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. Our business, reputation, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if, as a result of a significant cyber event or otherwise, our operations are disrupted or shutdown; our confidential, proprietary information is stolen or disclosed; the performance or security of our cloud-based product offerings is impacted; our intranet and internet sites are compromised; data is manipulated or destroyed; we incur costs or are required to pay fines in connection with stolen customer, employee, or other confidential information; we must dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection; or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs.Currency conversion risk could have a material impact on our reported results of business operations.Our operating results are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in which we conduct business could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into U.S. dollars. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, which may have a material adverse effect on sales or require us to lower our prices, and also decrease our reported revenues or margins related to sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent we are unable or determine not to increase local currency prices. Likewise, decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased overseas.We are subject to laws, regulations and potential liability relating to claims, complaints and proceedings, including those relating to environmental, product liability and other matters.We are subject to various laws, ordinances, regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the United States and other nations. With respect to acquisitions, divestitures and continuing operations, we may acquire or retain liabilities of which we are not aware, or which are of a different character or magnitude than expected. Additionally, changes in laws, ordinances, regulations or other governmental policies may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities.We face environmental exposures including, for example, those relating to discharges from and materials handled as part of our operations, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by petroleum products or hazardous substances or wastes, and the health and safety of our employees. We may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances or petroleum products on, under, or in our current or formerly owned or leased properties, or from third-party disposal facilities that we may have used, without regard to whether we knew of, or caused, the presence of the contaminants. The presence of, or failure to properly remediate, these substances may have adverse effects, including, for example, substantial investigative or remedial obligations and limitations on the ability to sell or rent affected property or to borrow funds using affected property as collateral. New or existing environmental matters or changes in environmental laws or policies could lead to material costs for environmental compliance or cleanup. In addition, environmentally related product regulations are growing globally in number and complexity and could contribute to increased costs with respect to disclosure requirements, product sales and distribution related costs, and post-sale recycling and disposal costs. There can be no assurance that these liabilities and costs will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Numerous claims, complaints and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business have been asserted or are pending against us or certain of our subsidiaries (collectively, “claims”). These claims relate to litigation matters (e.g., class actions, derivative lawsuits and contracts, intellectual property, and competitive claims), environmental matters, product liability matters (predominately associated with alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials), and other risk management matters (e.g., general liability, automobile, and workers' compensation claims). From time to time, we face actions by governmental authorities, both in and outside the United States. Additionally, we may become subject to other claims of which we are currently unaware, which may be significant, or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring significantly greater loss than we anticipate. Our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable (e.g., because of insurer insolvency) to protect us against potential loss exposures.We devote significant time and expense to defend against the various claims, complaints and proceedings brought against us, and we cannot assure you that the expenses or distractions from operating our businesses arising from these defenses will not increase materially.We cannot assure you that our accruals and right to indemnity and insurance will be sufficient, that recoveries from insurance or indemnification claims will be available or that any of our current or future claims or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.See ""MD&A - Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates - Contingent Liabilities"" and Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.9Governmental laws and regulations could negatively affect our business.Changes in laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject could have a significant negative impact on our business. In addition, we could face material costs and risks if it is determined that we have failed to comply with relevant law and regulation. We are subject to U.S. Customs and Export Regulations, including U.S. International Traffic and Arms Regulations and similar laws, which collectively control import, export and sale of technologies by companies and various other aspects of the operation of our business; the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws, which prohibit companies from making improper payments to government officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business; and the California Transparency in Supply Chain Act and similar laws and regulations which related to human trafficking and anti-slavery and impose new compliance requirements on our businesses and their suppliers. While our policies and procedures mandate compliance with such laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees and agents will always act in strict compliance. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations may result in civil and criminal enforcement, including monetary fines and possible injunctions against shipment of product or other of our activities, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Additionally, laws and regulations have increasingly focused on supply chain transparency. As part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC has promulgated disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals (tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold), which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, known as conflict minerals. Certain of our products contain gold, tungsten and tin. As a result, we must annually publicly disclose whether we manufacture any products that contain conflict minerals. Additionally, customers typically rely on us to provide critical data regarding the parts they purchase, including conflict mineral information. Our material sourcing is broad-based and multi-tiered, and it is difficult to verify the origins for conflict minerals used in the products we sell. We have many suppliers and each may provide conflict mineral information in a different manner, if at all. Accordingly, because the supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges from being unable to sufficiently verify the origins of conflict minerals used in our products.Changes in tax laws and regulations or other factors could cause our income tax rate to increase, potentially reducing our net income and adversely affecting our cash flows.As a global manufacturing company, we are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions around the world. In preparing our financial statements, we calculate our effective income tax rate based on current tax laws and regulations and the estimated taxable income within each of these jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rate, however, may be higher due to numerous factors, including changes in tax laws or regulations. An effective income tax rate significantly higher than our expectations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity.Officials in some of the jurisdictions in which we do business have proposed, or announced that they are reviewing, tax changes that could potentially increase taxes, and other revenue-raising laws and regulations, including those that may be enacted as a result of the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project. Any such changes in tax laws or regulations could impose new restrictions, costs or prohibitions on existing practices as well as reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows.The loss of key personnel and an inability to attract and retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations.We are dependent on the continued services of our leadership team. The loss of these personnel without adequate replacement could have a material adverse effect on our operations. A substantial portion of our executive leadership team moved to SPX FLOW upon the completion of the Spin-Off and were replaced by a new leadership team, which may cause a disruption to or adversely impact our business. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience in many locations in order to operate our business successfully. From time to time, there may be a shortage of skilled labor, which may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain qualified employees. If we were unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals or our costs to do so were to increase significantly, our operations could be materially adversely affected.10Our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.At December 31, 2015, we had $373.8 in total indebtedness. On that same date, we had $301.9 of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities, after giving effect to $48.1 reserved for outstanding letters of credit, and $40.1 of available borrowing capacity under our trade receivables financing arrangement. In addition, at December 31, 2015, we had $224.1 of available issuance capacity under our foreign credit instrument facilities after giving effect to $275.9 reserved for outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2015, our cash and equivalents balance was $101.4. See MD&A and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance, or assumed in connection with, acquisitions. We may renegotiate or refinance our senior credit facilities or other debt facilities, or enter into additional agreements that have different or more stringent terms. The level of our indebtedness could:•Impact our ability to obtain new, or refinance existing, indebtedness, on favorable terms or at all; •Limit our ability to obtain, or obtain on favorable terms, additional debt financing for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions; •Limit our flexibility in reacting to competitive and other changes in the industry and economic conditions; •Limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock in the future; •Coupled with a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows due to economic developments or adverse developments in our business, make it difficult to meet debt service requirements; and •Expose us to interest rate fluctuations to the extent existing borrowings are, and any new borrowings may be, at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expense and interest payments in the event of increases in interest rates. Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal or pay interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors beyond our control. In addition, we cannot assure you that future borrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, whether in the ordinary course of business or upon an acceleration of such indebtedness, we may pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, revising implementation of or delaying strategic plans or seeking additional equity capital. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. In addition, we cannot assure that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements, or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements. Numerous banks in many countries are syndicate members in our credit facility. Failure of one or more of our larger lenders, or several of our smaller lenders, could significantly reduce availability of our credit, which could harm our liquidity.We may not be able to finance future needs or adapt our business plan to react to changes in economic or business conditions because of restrictions placed on us by our senior credit facilities and any existing or future instruments governing our other indebtedness.Our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain, or future or revised instruments may contain, various restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied. We also must comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests. Our subsidiaries may also be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us. In addition, our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain or may contain additional affirmative and negative covenants. Material existing restrictions are described more fully in the MD&A and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. Each of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities, such as acquisitions.If we do not comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness, we could default under those agreements, and the debt, together with accrued interest, could be declared due and payable. If we default under our senior credit facilities, the lenders could cause all our outstanding debt obligations under our senior credit facilities to become due and payable or require us to repay the indebtedness under these facilities. If our debt is accelerated, we may not be able to repay or refinance our debt. In addition, any default under our senior credit facilities or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. If the indebtedness under our senior credit facilities is accelerated, we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due under our senior credit facilities or other debt securities then outstanding. Our ability to comply with these provisions 11of our senior credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness will be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control. Complying with our covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to us and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete, including against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.Difficulties presented by international economic, political, legal, accounting and business factors could negatively affect our business.In 2015, approximately 27% of our revenues were generated outside the United States. As part of our strategy, we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide. Our reliance on non-U.S. revenues and non-U.S. manufacturing bases exposes us to a number of risks, including:•Significant competition could come from local or long-term participants in non-U.S. markets who may have significantly greater market knowledge and substantially greater resources than we do;•Local customers may have a preference for locally-produced products;•Failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws regulating trade, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other anti-corruption laws, could result in adverse consequences, including fines, criminal sanctions, or loss of access to markets; •Credit risk or financial condition of local customers and distributors could affect our ability to market our products or collect receivables;•Regulatory or political systems or barriers may make it difficult or impossible to enter or remain in new markets. In addition, these barriers may impact our existing businesses, including making it more difficult for them to grow;•Local political, economic and social conditions, including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions, political instability, nationalization of private enterprises, or unexpected changes relating to currency could adversely impact our operations;•Customs and tariffs may make it difficult or impossible for us to move our products or assets across borders in a cost-effective manner;•Transportation and shipping expenses add cost to our products;•Complications related to shipping, including delays due to weather, labor action, or customs, may impact our profit margins or lead to lost business;•Government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions such as anti-dumping duties, as well as the imposition of trade sanctions by the United States or the European Union against a class of products imported from or sold and exported to, or the loss of ""normal trade relations"" status with, countries in which we conduct business, could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the United States or Europe or reduce our sales and harm our business;•Environmental and other laws and regulations could increase our costs or limit our ability to run our business;•Our ability to obtain supplies from foreign vendors and ship products internationally may be impaired during times of crisis or otherwise;•Local, regional or worldwide hostilities could impact our operations; and•Distance, language and cultural differences may make it more difficult to manage our business and employees and to effectively market our products and services.Any of the above factors or other factors affecting social and economic activity in China, South Africa and other emerging markets or affecting the movement of people and products into and from these countries to our major markets, including North America and Europe, could have a significant negative effect on our operations.Dispositions or our failure to successfully complete dispositions could negatively affect us.Our dispositions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from running our core businesses, increased expense associated with the dispositions, potential disputes with the customers or suppliers of the disposed businesses, potential disputes with the acquirers of the disposed businesses and a potential dilutive effect on our earnings per share.If dispositions are not completed in a timely manner, there may be a negative effect on our cash flows and/or our ability to execute our strategy. In addition, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Spin-Off of SPX FLOW or our other dispositions. See ""Business,"" ""MD&A - Results of Discontinued Operations,"" and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for the status of our divestitures.12Our failure to successfully complete acquisitions could negatively affect us.We may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions, which could materially impact our growth rate, results of operations, future cash flows and stock price. Our ability to achieve our goals depends upon, among other things, our ability to identify and successfully acquire companies, businesses and product lines, to effectively integrate them and to achieve cost savings. We may also be unable to raise additional funds necessary to consummate these acquisitions. In addition, decreases in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to consummate acquisitions. Competition for acquisitions in our business areas may be significant and result in higher prices for businesses, including businesses that we may target, which may also affect our acquisition rate or benefits achieved from our acquisitions.We may not achieve the expected cost savings and other benefits of our acquisitions.We strive for and expect to achieve cost savings in connection with our acquisitions, including: (i) manufacturing process and supply chain rationalization, (ii) streamlining redundant administrative overhead and support activities, and (iii) restructuring and repositioning sales and marketing organizations to eliminate redundancies. Cost savings expectations are estimates that are inherently difficult to predict and are necessarily speculative in nature, and we cannot assure you that we will achieve expected, or any, cost savings. In addition, we cannot assure you that unforeseen factors will not offset the estimated cost savings or other benefits from our acquisitions. As a result, anticipated benefits could be delayed, differ significantly from our estimates and the other information contained in this report, or not be realized.Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could have a negative effect on our operations; our acquisitions could cause financial difficulties.Our acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:•Adverse effects on our reported operating results due to charges to earnings, including impairment charges associated with goodwill and other intangibles;•Diversion of management attention from core business operations;•Integration of technology, operations, personnel and financial and other systems;•Increased expenses;•Increased foreign operations, often with unique issues relating to corporate culture, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and other challenges;•Assumption of known and unknown liabilities and exposure to litigation;•Increased levels of debt or dilution to existing shareholders; and•Potential disputes with the sellers of acquired businesses, technology, services or products.In addition, internal controls over financial reporting of acquired companies may not be compliant with required standards. Issues may exist that could rise to the level of significant deficiencies or, in some cases, material weaknesses, particularly with respect to foreign companies or non-public U.S. companies.Our integration activities may place substantial demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. Customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business, technology, service or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.Increases in the number of shares of our outstanding common stock could adversely affect our common stock price or dilute our earnings per share.Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock into the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. As of December 31, 2015, we had the ability to issue up to an additional 0.470 shares as restricted stock shares, restricted stock units, or stock options under our 2002 Stock Compensation Plan, as amended in 2006, 2011, 2012 and 2015, and our 2006 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Incentive Plan. Additionally, we may issue a significant number of additional shares, in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. We also may issue a significant number of additional shares, either through an existing shelf registration statement or through other mechanisms. Additional shares issued would have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share.If the fair value of any of our reporting units is insufficient to recover the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangibles of the respective reporting unit, a material non-cash charge to earnings could result.At December 31, 2015, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net, of $516.0. We conduct annual impairment testing to determine if we will be able to recover all or a portion of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived 13intangibles. In addition, we review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment more frequently if impairment indicators arise. If the fair value is insufficient to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, we may be required to record a material non-cash charge to earnings.The fair values of our reporting units generally are based on discounted cash flow projections that are believed to be reasonable under current and forecasted circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of the reported net assets of our reporting units. Other considerations are also incorporated, including comparable price multiples. Many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets that they serve. Accordingly, we consider estimates and judgments that affect the future cash flow projections, including principal methods of competition such as volume, price, service, product performance and technical innovations and estimates associated with cost reduction initiatives, capacity utilization, and assumptions for inflation and foreign currency changes. We monitor impairment indicators across all of our businesses. Significant changes in market conditions and estimates or judgments used to determine expected future cash flows that indicate a reduction in carrying value may give, and have given, rise to impairments in the period that the change becomes known.Cost reduction actions may affect our business.Cost reduction actions often result in charges against earnings. These charges can vary significantly from period to period and, as a result, we may experience fluctuations in our reported net income and earnings per share due to the timing of restructuring actions.Our technology is important to our success, and failure to develop new products may result in a significant competitive disadvantage.We believe the development of our intellectual property rights is critical to the success of our business. In order to maintain our market positions and margins, we need to continually develop and introduce high quality, technologically advanced and cost-effective products on a timely basis, in many cases in multiple jurisdictions around the world. The failure to do so could result in a significant competitive disadvantage.Our current and planned products may contain defects or errors that are detected only after delivery to customers. If that occurs, our reputation may be harmed and we may face additional costs.We cannot assure you that our product development, manufacturing and integration testing will be adequate to detect all defects, errors, failures and quality issues that could impact customer satisfaction or result in claims against us with regard to our products. As a result, we may have, and from time to time have had, to replace certain components and/or provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects in products that are shipped. The occurrence of any defects, errors, failures or quality issues could result in cancellation of orders, product returns, diversion of our resources, legal actions by our customers or our customers' end users and other losses to us or to any of our customers or end users, and could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and loss of sales, which would harm our business and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.Changes in key estimates and assumptions related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, such as discount rates, assumed long-term return on assets, assumed long-term trends of future cost, and accounting and legislative changes, as well as actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and other actuarial factors, could affect our results of operations and cash flows.We have defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, including both qualified and non-qualified plans, which cover a portion of our salaried and hourly employees and retirees including a portion of our employees and retirees in foreign countries. As of December 31, 2015, these plans were underfunded by $204.9. The determination of funding requirements and pension expense or income associated with these plans involves significant judgment, particularly with respect to discount rates, long-term trends of future costs and other actuarial assumptions. If our assumptions change significantly due to changes in economic, legislative and/or demographic experience or circumstances, our pension and other benefit plans' expense, funded status and our required cash contributions to such plans could be negatively impacted. In addition, returns on plan assets could have a material impact on our pension plans' expense, funded status and our required contributions to the plans. Changes in regulations or law could also significantly impact our obligations. For example, See ""MD&A - Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates"" for the impact that changes in certain assumptions used in the calculation of our costs and obligations associated with these plans could have on our results of operations and financial position.We are subject to work stoppages, union negotiations, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force, which may adversely impact our operations and cause us to incur incremental costs.14At December 31, 2015, we had over 6,000 employees. Six domestic collective bargaining agreements covered approximately 1,000 employees. We also had various collective labor arrangements as of that date covering certain non-U.S. employee groups. We are subject to potential union campaigns, work stoppages, union negotiations and other potential labor disputes. Further, we may be subject to work stoppages, which are beyond our control, at our suppliers or customers.Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company, and accordingly, we may not consummate a transaction that our shareholders consider favorable.Provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws may inhibit changes in control of our company not approved by our Board. These provisions include, for example: a staggered board of directors; a prohibition on shareholder action by written consent; a requirement that special shareholder meetings be called only by our Chairman, President or Board; advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations; limitations on shareholders' ability to amend, alter or repeal the By-laws; enhanced voting requirements for certain business combinations involving substantial shareholders; the authority of our Board to issue, without shareholder approval, preferred stock with terms determined in its discretion; and limitations on shareholders' ability to remove directors. In addition, we are afforded the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could have similar effects. In general, Section 203 prohibits us from engaging in a ""business combination"" with an ""interested shareholder"" (each as defined in Section 203) for at least three years after the time the person became an interested shareholder unless certain conditions are met. These protective provisions could result in our not consummating a transaction that our shareholders consider favorable or discourage entities from attempting to acquire us, potentially at a significant premium to our then-existing stock price.Risks Related to our Spin-Off of SPX FLOWOur business is less diversified following the Spin-Off of SPX FLOW.Our operational and financial profile has changed as a result of the Spin-off of SPX FLOW. As a result, our diversification of revenue sources has diminished without the revenue previously generated by the Flow Technology reportable segment and Hydraulic Technologies business, and our results of operations, cash flows, working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility. If we are unable to manage that volatility, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.The Spin-Off of SPX FLOW could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders.In connection with the Spin-Off of SPX FLOW we received opinions of tax counsel satisfactory to us as to the tax-free treatment of the Spin-Off and certain related transactions. However, if the factual assumptions or representations upon which the opinions are based are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, we will not be able to rely on the opinions. Furthermore, the opinions are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") or the courts. Accordingly, the IRS may challenge the conclusions set forth in the opinions and any such challenge could prevail. If, notwithstanding the opinions, the Spin-Off or a related transaction is determined to be taxable, we could be subject to a substantial tax liability. In addition, if the Spin-Off is determined to be taxable, each holder of our common stock who received shares of SPX FLOW would generally be treated as having received a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received.Even if the Spin-Off otherwise qualifies as a tax-free transaction, the distribution could be taxable to us (but not to our stockholders) in certain circumstances if future significant acquisitions of our stock or the stock of SPX FLOW are determined to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Spin-Off. In this event, the resulting tax liability would be substantial. In connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with SPX FLOW, under which SPX FLOW agreed (i) not to enter into any transaction without our consent that could cause the Spin-Off to be taxable to us, and (ii) to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from such a transaction. The indemnity from SPX FLOW may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities. Any tax liabilities resulting from the Spin-Off or related transactions could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.In connection with the Spin-Off, SPX FLOW will indemnify us for certain liabilities and we will indemnify SPX FLOW for certain liabilities. If we are required to act on these indemnities to SPX FLOW, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted. The SPX FLOW indemnity may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of liabilities for which we will be allocated responsibility, and SPX FLOW may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.15Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement and the Tax Matters Agreement between us and SPX FLOW, SPX FLOW has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we have agreed to indemnify SPX FLOW for certain liabilities, in each case for uncapped amounts. Such indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact our business. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that SPX FLOW has assumed. Further, the indemnity from SPX FLOW may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, and SPX FLOW may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from SPX FLOW any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.A court could require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to SPX under the Separation and Distribution Agreement.Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, both we and SPX FLOW are responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses which it owns and operates. Although we do not expect to be liable for any obligations that are not allocated to us under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, a court could disregard the allocation agreed to between the parties, and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to SPX FLOW, particularly if SPX FLOW were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform the allocated obligations.Certain of our executive officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their prior relationships with SPX FLOW executive officers and directors, their current affiliation with SPX FLOW, or their ownership of SPX FLOW equity.Certain of our executive officers and directors have served on other boards with or are former subordinate employees of the directors, officers or employees of SPX FLOW and thus have professional relationships with SPX FLOW’s executive officers and directors. One of our directors also serves on the board of directors of SPX FLOW. In addition, the majority of our executive officers have a financial interest in SPX FLOW as a result of their beneficial ownership of SPX FLOW equity. These relationships and financial interests may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers face decisions that could have different implications for SPX FLOW than for us.We might have been able to receive better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we receive in our agreements with SPX FLOW.The agreements related to the Spin-Off, including the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement, the Trademark License Agreement, and any other agreements, were negotiated in the context of our Spin-Off of SPX FLOW while it was still our subsidiary and under common executive leadership with us. Substantially all of our executive leadership team moved to SPX FLOW upon the completion of the Spin-Off. Although these agreements are intended to be on an arm's-length basis, they may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm's-length negotiations among unaffiliated third parties. The terms of the agreements negotiated in the context of the Spin-Off concern, among other things, allocations of assets, liabilities, rights, indemnifications and other obligations among SPX FLOW and us.The Spin-Off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements.The Spin-Off is subject to review under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. Fraudulent conveyance laws generally provide that an entity engages in a constructive fraudulent conveyance when (1) the entity transfers assets and does not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in return, and (2) the entity (a) is insolvent at the time of the transfer or is rendered insolvent by the transfer, (b) has unreasonably small capital with which to carry on its business, or (c) intends to incur or believes it will incur debts beyond its ability to repay its debts as they mature. An unpaid creditor or an entity acting on behalf of a creditor (including, without limitation, a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy by us or SPX FLOW or any of our respective subsidiaries) may bring a lawsuit alleging that the Spin-Off or any of the related transactions constituted a constructive fraudulent conveyance. If a court accepts these allegations, it could impose a number of remedies, including, without limitation, voiding the distribution and returning SPX FLOW’s assets or SPX FLOW’s shares and subject us to liability.The measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws will vary depending on which jurisdiction's law is applied. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if (1) the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (including contingent liabilities); (2) the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than its probable liabilities on its debts as such debts become absolute and matured; (3) it cannot 16pay its debts and other liabilities (including contingent liabilities and other commitments) as they mature; or (4) it has unreasonably small capital for the business in which it is engaged. We cannot assure you what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that we, SPX FLOW or any of our respective subsidiaries were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the Spin-Off.The distribution of SPX FLOW common stock is also subject to review under state corporate distribution statutes. Under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the ""DGCL""), a corporation may only pay dividends to its shareholders either (1) out of its surplus (net assets) or (2) if there is no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year.Although we believe that we and SPX FLOW were each solvent at the time of the Spin-Off (including immediately after the distribution of shares of SPX FLOW common stock), that we are able to repay our debts as they mature and have sufficient capital to carry on our businesses, and that the distribution was made entirely out of surplus in accordance with Section 170 of the DGCL, we cannot assure you that a court would reach the same conclusions in determining whether SPX FLOW or we were insolvent at the time of, or after giving effect to, the Spin-Off, or whether lawful funds were available for the separation and the distribution to our shareholders.17"
3,SPXC,SPX CORP,2015-02-23,"ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
     (Allcurrency and share amounts are in millions)         Youshould consider the risks described below and elsewhere in our documents filed with the SEC before investing in any of our securities. We may amend, supplement or add to the riskfactors described below from time to time in future reports filed with the SEC. We face risks related to our planned spin-off of our flow business.          We have announced our intention to spin-off our Flow Technology reportable segment and our Hydraulic Technologiesbusiness, comprising approximately $2,800.0 of our company's total revenues for 2014. Unanticipated developments, including possible delays in obtaining required approvals, uncertainty of thefinancial markets, and challenges relating to the structure of the transaction or resulting companies, could delay or prevent theplanned transaction, or cause it to occur on less favorable terms or conditions than projected. In addition, in connection with the spin-off, we and the new stand-alone company that will result fromthe spin-off will need to incur new indebtedness to refinance our existing credit facilities. We and the new stand-alone company may be unable to obtain such indebtedness or any indebtedness that weand the new stand-alone company obtain may contain terms that are materially less favorable than the terms of our existing credit facilities. Even if the transaction is completed as and on thetimetable currently contemplated, we may not realize some or all projected benefits, or expenses relating to the planned transaction may be significantly higher than projected.         Additionally,the planned transaction requires significant time and attention, which could distract management and other employee attention from the day-to-day operation of our business.Following completion of the transaction, there can be no guarantee the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly-traded companies will equal or exceed the value of our stock had thetransaction not occurred. The planned spin-off of our flow business could result in substantial tax liability to us and ourstockholders.          Among the conditions to completing the spin-off will be our receipt of opinions of tax counsel satisfactory to us as tothe tax-free treatment of the spin-off and certain related transactions. However, if the factual assumptions or representations upon which the opinions are based are inaccurate or incomplete in anymaterial respect, we will not be able to rely on the opinions. Furthermore, the opinions will not be binding on the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") or the courts. Accordingly, the IRS or the courtsmay challenge the conclusions set forth in the opinions and any such challenge could prevail. If, notwithstanding receipt of the opinions, the spin-off or a related transaction is determined to betaxable, we could be subject to a substantial tax liability. In addition, if the spin-off is determined to be taxable, each holder of our common stock who receives shares of the new stand-alonecompany would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received.         Evenif the spin-off otherwise qualifies as a tax-free transaction, the distribution could be taxable to us (but not to our stockholders) in certain circumstances if future significantacquisitions of our stock or the stock of the new stand-alone company are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the spin-off. In this event, the resulting taxliability would be substantial. In connection with the spin-off, we expect to enter into a tax matters agreement with the new stand-alone company, under which it will agree (i) not to enterinto any transaction without our consent that could cause any portion of the spin-off to be taxable to us, and (ii) to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from such a transaction.This obligation and potential tax liability may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of us or of the new stand-alone company. In addition, we may have to restructure various aspects of thetransaction in response to tax considerations, which could subject us to significant additional costs. Difficulties presented by international economic, political, legal, accounting and business factorscould negatively affect our business.          We are an increasingly global company. In 2014, over 50% of our revenues were generated outside the United States. Wehave placed a particular emphasis on expanding our presence in emerging markets. Aspart of our strategy, we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide. Our reliance on non-U.S. revenues and non-U.S. manufacturing bases exposes us to a number of risks,including: Significant competition could come from local or long-term participants in non-U.S. markets who may have significantly greater marketknowledge and substantially greater resources than we do;  Local customers may have a preference for locally-produced products; 7  Failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws regulating trade, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and otheranti-corruption laws, could result in adverse consequences, including fines, criminal sanctions, or loss of access to markets;  Credit risk or financial condition of local customers and distributors could affect our ability to market our products or collectreceivables;  Regulatory or political systems or barriers may make it difficult or impossible to enter or remain in new markets. In addition, thesebarriers may impact our existing businesses, including making it more difficult for them to grow;  Local political, economic and social conditions, including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions, political instability,nationalization of private enterprises, or unexpected changes relating to currency could adversely impact our operations;  Customs and tariffs may make it difficult or impossible for us to move our products or assets across borders in a cost-effectivemanner;  Transportation and shipping expenses add cost to our products;  Complications related to shipping, including delays due to weather, labor action, or customs, may impact our profit margins or lead tolost business;  Government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions such as anti-dumping duties, as well as the imposition of trade sanctions by theUnited States or the European Union against a class of products imported from or sold and exported to, or the loss of ""normal trade relations"" status with, countries in which we conduct business,could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the United States or Europe or reduce our sales and harm our business;  Environmental and other laws and regulations could increase our costs or limit our ability to run our business;   Our ability to obtain supplies from foreign vendors and ship products internationally may be impaired during times of crisis orotherwise;  Local, regional or worldwide hostilities could impact our operations; and  Distance, language and cultural differences may make it more difficult to manage our business and employees and to effectively marketour products and services.         Anyof the above factors or other factors affecting social and economic activity in China, South Africa and other emerging markets or affecting the movement of people and products intoand from these countries to our major markets, including North America and Europe, could have a significant negative effect on our operations. Many of the markets in which we operate are cyclical or are subject to industry events, and ourresults have been and could be affected as a result.          Many of the markets in which we operate are subject to general economic cycles or industry events. In addition, certainof our businesses are subject to market-specific cycles, including, but not limited to: The oil and gas, chemical, mining and petrochemical markets;  Food and beverage markets; and  The electric power and infrastructure markets.         Inaddition, contract timing on large construction projects, including food and beverage systems, projects in the oil and gas industries, and cooling systems and towers, may causesignificant fluctuations in revenues and profits from period to period.         Thebusinesses of many of our customers, particularly oil and gas companies, chemical companies and general industrial companies, are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced,and may continue to experience, periodic downturns. Cyclical changes and specific industry events could also affect sales of products in our other businesses. Downturns in the business cycles of ourdifferent operations may occur at the same time, which could exacerbate any adverse effects on our business. See ""MD&A  Results of Reportable Segments and Other OperatingSegments."" In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal fluctuations. Historically, some of our key businesses generally tend to be stronger in the second half of the year. 8 Cost overruns, inflation, delays and other risks could significantly impact our results,particularly with respect to long-term fixed-price contracts.          A portion of our revenues and earnings is generated through long-term fixed-price contracts, particularly in our FlowTechnology and Thermal Equipment and Services reportable segments. We recognize revenues from certain of these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting whereby revenues andexpenses, and thereby profit, in a given period are determined based on our estimates as to the project status and the costs remaining to complete a particular project.         Estimatesof total revenues and cost at completion are subject to many variables, including the length of time to complete a contract. In addition, contract delays may negatively impactthese estimates and our revenues and earnings results for affected periods.         Tothe extent that we underestimate the remaining cost to complete a project, we may overstate the revenues and profit in a particular period. Further, certain of these contracts providefor penalties or liquidated damages for failure to timely perform our obligations under the contract, or require that we, at our expense, correct and remedy to the satisfaction of the other partycertain defects. Because some of our long-term contracts are at a fixed price, we face the risk that cost overruns or inflation may exceed, erode or eliminate our expected profit margin, or cause usto record a loss on our projects.         Ourlarge power projects in South Africa are an example of these types of long-term-contract-related risks. These projects, which have already experienced significant delays from theirinitial target completion dates, involve a complex set of contractual relationships among the end customer, the prime contractors, and the various subcontractors and suppliers. Although we believethat our current estimates of costs relating to these projects are reasonable, we cannot assure you that additional costs will not arise as these projects are completed. Our business depends on capital investment and maintenance expenditures by our customers.          Demand for most of our products and services depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenanceexpenditures by our customers. The level of capital expenditures by our customers fluctuates based on planned expansions, new builds, and repairs, commodity prices, general economic conditions,availability of credit, and expectations of future market behavior. Any of these factors, whether individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, in turn,our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our customers could be impacted by commodity availability and prices.          A number of factors outside our control, including fluctuating commodity prices, impact the demand for our products.Increased commodity prices may increase our customers' cost of doing business, thus causing them to delay or cancel large capital projects.         Onthe other hand, declining commodity prices may cause mines, oil refineries, oil and gas extraction fields and other customers to delay or cancel projects relating to the production ofsuch commodities. For example, recent declines in oil prices have led to reduced revenues in the upstream portion of our oil and gas business. Reduced demand for our products and services could resultin the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity, which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. This reduced demand may also erodeaverage selling prices in the relevant market. The price and availability of raw materials may adversely affect our business.          We are exposed to a variety of risks relating to the price and availability of raw materials. In recent years, we havefaced volatility in the prices of many of our key raw materials, including petroleum-based products, steel and copper. Increases in the prices of raw materials or shortages or allocations of materialsmay have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as we may not be able to pass cost increases on to our customers, or our sales may be reduced. We aresubject to long-term supplier contracts that may increase our exposure to pricing fluctuations. Credit and counterparty risks could harm our business.          The financial condition of our customers and distributors could affect our ability to market our products or collectreceivables.         Ourcustomers may suffer financial difficulties that make them unable to pay for a project when completed, or they may decide not or be unable to pay us, either as a matter of corporatedecision-making or in response to changes in local laws and 9 regulations.We cannot assure you that expenses or losses for uncollectible amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.         Inaddition, financial difficulties faced by our customers may lead to cancellation or delay of orders. Failure to protect or unauthorized use of our intellectual property may harm our business.          Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtainand use our products or technology. The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology or knowledge, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect ourproprietary rights to the same extent as in the United States. Costs incurred to defend our rights may be material. If we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks ornetwork security breaches, our operations could be disrupted.          We are increasingly dependent on information technology (""IT"") networks and systems, including the Internet, toprocess, transmit and store electronic information. In particular, we depend on such IT infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and between our personnel andsuppliers and customers, and we rely on the systems and services of a variety of vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs. Despite our implementation of security measures,cybersecurity threats, such as malicious software, phishing attacks, computer viruses and attempts to gain authorized access, cannot be completely mitigated. Security breaches of our, our customers'and our vendors' IT infrastructure can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including our intellectual property, trade secrets, customerinformation or other confidential business information. If we are unable to prevent, detect or adequately respond to such breaches, our operations could be disrupted, our competitiveness could beadversely affected or we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information. Such incidents also could require significant management attention and resources andincreased costs. Currency conversion risk could have a material impact on our reported results of businessoperations.          Our operating results are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of theU.S. dollar against other currencies in which we conduct business could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into U.S. dollars.Increasedstrength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, which may have a material adverse effect on sales or require us to lower ourprices, and also decrease our reported revenues or margins related to sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent we are unable or determine not to increase local currency prices. Likewise,decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased overseas. Worldwide economic conditions could negatively impact our businesses.          Many of our customers historically have tended to delay large capital projects, including expensive maintenance andupgrades, during economic downturns. Poor macroeconomic conditions could negatively impact our businesses by adversely affecting, among other things,our: Revenues;  Margins;  Profits;  Cash flows;  Customers' orders, including order cancellation activity or delays on existing orders;   Customers' ability to access credit;  Customers' ability to pay amounts due to us; and  Suppliers' and distributors' ability to perform and the availability and costs of materials and subcontracted services.         Ourprojections for 2015 assume a generally stable economy. If actual economic conditions are inconsistent with this assumption, our performance could underperform our expectations. 10 We are subject to laws, regulations and potential liability relating to claims, complaints andproceedings, including those relating to environmental and other matters.          We are subject to various laws, ordinances, regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the UnitedStates and other nations. With respect to acquisitions, divestitures and continuing operations, we may acquire or retain liabilities of which we are not aware, or which are of a different character ormagnitude than expected. Additionally, changes in laws, ordinances, regulations or other governmental policies may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities.         Weface environmental exposures including, for example, those relating to discharges from and materials handled as part of our operations, the remediation of soil and groundwatercontaminated by petroleum products or hazardous substances or wastes, and the health and safety of our employees. We may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardoussubstances or petroleum products on, under, or in our current or formerly owned or leased properties, or from third-party disposal facilities that we may have used, without regard to whether we knewof, or caused, the presence of the contaminants. The presence of, or failure to properly remediate, these substances may have adverse effects, including, for example, substantial investigative orremedial obligations and limitations on the ability to sell or rent affected property or to borrow funds using affected property as collateral. New or existing environmental matters or changes inenvironmental laws or policies could lead to material costs for environmental compliance or cleanup. There can be no assurance that these liabilities and costs will not have a material adverse effecton our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.         Numerousclaims, complaints and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including those relating to litigation matters (e.g., class actions, derivative lawsuitsand contracts, intellectual property and competitive claims), environmental matters, and risk management matters (e.g., product and general liability, automobile, and workers' compensationclaims), have been filed or are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries. From time to time, weface actions by governmental authorities, both in and outside the United States. Additionally, we may become subject to significant claims of which we are currently unaware or the claims of which weare aware may result in our incurring a significantly greater liability than we anticipate. Our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable (e.g., because of insurer insolvency) to protect usagainst potential loss exposures.         Wedevote significant time and expense to defend against the various claims, complaints and proceedings brought against us, and we cannot assure you that the expenses or distractionsfrom operating our businesses arising from these defenses will not increase materially.         Wecannot assure you that our accruals and right to indemnity and insurance will be sufficient, that recoveries from insurance or indemnification claims will be available or that any ofour current or future claims or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.         See""MD&A  Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates  Contingent Liabilities"" and Note 14 to our consolidated financial statementsfor further discussion. Governmental laws and regulations could negatively affect our business.          Changes in laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject could have a significant negative impact on ourbusiness. In addition, we could face material costs and risks if it is determined that we have failed to comply with relevant law and regulation. Failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. lawsregulating trade, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other anti-corruption laws, could result in adverse consequences, including fines, criminal sanctions, or loss of access tomarkets.         Inaddition, costs associated with regulatory compliance can be difficult to predict. If we underestimate the time or costs required to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations,our actual costs may significantly exceed our projections, which could impact our results of operations. Changes in tax laws and regulations or other factors could cause our income tax rate to increase,potentially reducing our net income and adversely affecting our cash flows.          As a global manufacturing company, we are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions around the world. In preparingour financial statements, we calculate our effective income tax rate based on current tax laws and regulations and the estimated taxable income within each of these jurisdictions. Our effective incometax rate, however, may be higher due to numerous factors, including changes in tax laws or regulations. An effective income tax rate significantly higher than our expectations could have an adverseeffect on our business, results of operations and liquidity. 11         Officialsin some of the jurisdictions in which we do business have proposed, or announced that they are reviewing, tax changes that could potentially increase taxes, and otherrevenue-raising laws and regulations, including those that may be enacted as a result of the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Splitting project. Any such changes in tax laws or regulations could imposenew restrictions, costs or prohibitions on existing practices as well as reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows. The loss of key personnel and an inability to attract and retain qualified employees could have amaterial adverse effect on our operations.          We are dependent on the continued services of our leadership team. The loss of these personnel without adequatereplacement could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience in manylocations in order to operate our business successfully. From time to time, there may be a shortage of skilled labor, which may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retainqualified employees. If we were unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals or our costs to do so were to increase significantly, our operations could be materiallyadversely affected. Our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.          At December 31, 2014, we had $1,369.7 in total indebtedness. On that same date, we had $313.2 of availableborrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities, after giving effect to borrowings under the domestic revolving loan facility of $133.0 and $53.8 reserved for outstanding letters of credit,and $70.0 of available borrowing capacity under our trade receivables financing arrangement after giving effect to outstanding borrowings of $10.0. In addition, at December 31, 2014, we had$304.7 of available issuance capacity under our foreign credit instrument facilities after giving effect to $695.3 reserved for outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2014, our cash andequivalents balance was $427.6. See MD&A and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtednessincurred to finance, or assumed in connection with, acquisitions. We may renegotiate or refinance our senior credit facilities, senior notes or other debt facilities, or enter into additionalagreements that have different or more stringent terms. The level of our indebtedness could: Impact our ability and the ability of the new stand-alone company that will result from the planned spin-off to obtain new, orrefinance existing, indebtedness, as needed in connection with the spin-off, on favorable terms or at all;  Limit our ability to obtain, or obtain on favorable terms, additional debt financing for working capital, capital expenditures oracquisitions;  Limit our flexibility in reacting to competitive and other changes in the industry and economic conditions;   Limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock;  Coupled with a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows due to economic developments or adverse developments in our business,make it difficult to meet debt service requirements; and  Expose us to interest rate fluctuations to the extent existing borrowings are, and any new borrowings may be, at variable rates ofinterest, which could result in higher interest expense and interest payments in the event of increases in interest rates.         Ourability to make scheduled payments of principal or pay interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operatingperformance, which may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors beyond our control. In addition, we cannot assure you that futureborrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, whether in the ordinary course of business or upon anacceleration of such indebtedness, we may pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures,revising implementation of or delaying strategic plans or seeking additional equity capital. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results ofoperations and stock price. In addition, we cannot assure that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements, orthat these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements.         Numerousbanks in many countries are syndicate members in our credit facility. Failure of one or more of our larger lenders, or several of our smaller lenders, could significantly reduceavailability of our credit, which could harm our liquidity. 12 We may not be able to finance future needs or adapt our business plan to react to changes ineconomic or business conditions because of restrictions placed on us by our senior credit facilities and any existing or future instruments governing our other indebtedness.          Our senior credit facilities, the indenture governing our senior notes and agreements governing our other indebtednesscontain, or future or revised instruments may contain, various restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unless certainfinancial tests or other criteria are satisfied. We also must comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests. Our subsidiaries may also be subject to restrictions on their ability to makedistributions to us. In addition, our senior credit facilities, indenture governing our senior notes and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain or may contain additional affirmative andnegative covenants. Material existing restrictions are described more fully in the MD&A and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. Each of these restrictions could affect our abilityto operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities, such as acquisitions.         Ifwe do not comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our senior credit facilities, indenture governing our senior notes and agreements governing our other indebtedness,we could default under those agreements, and the debt, together with accrued interest, could be declared due and payable. If we default under our senior credit facilities, the lenders could cause allour outstanding debt obligations under our senior credit facilities to become due and payable or require us to repay the indebtedness under these facilities. If our debt is accelerated, we may not beable to repay or refinance our debt. In addition, any default under our senior credit facilities, indenture governing our senior notes or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to anacceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. If the indebtedness under our senior credit facilities is accelerated, we may not havesufficient assets to repay amounts due under our senior credit facilities, senior notes or other debt securities then outstanding. Our ability to comply with these provisions of our senior creditfacilities, indenture governing our senior notes and agreements governing our other indebtedness will be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control.Complying with our covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to us and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete, includingagainst companies that are not subject to such restrictions. We operate in highly competitive markets. Our failure to compete effectively could harm ourbusiness.          We sell our products in highly competitive markets, which could result in pressure on our profit margins and limit ourability to maintain or increase the market share of our products. We compete on a number of fronts, including on the basis of product offerings, technical capabilities, quality, service and pricing.We have a number of competitors with substantial technological and financial resources, brand recognition and established relationships with global service providers. Some of our competitors have lowcost structures, support from local governments, or both. In addition, new competitors may enter the markets in which we participate. Competitors may be able to offer lower prices, additional productsor services or a more attractive mix of products or services, or services or other incentives that we cannot or will not match. These competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly tonew or emergingtechnologies and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, and make more attractive offers to potential customers, employees and strategic partners. In addition, competitiveenvironments in slow-growth markets, to which some of our businesses have exposure, have been inherently more influenced by pricing and domestic and global economic conditions. To remain competitive,we must invest in manufacturing, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. No assurances can be made that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make theinvestment required to maintain or increase our market share or that our investments will be successful. If we do not compete successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operations andcash flows could be materially adversely affected. Our strategy to outsource various elements of the products and services we sell subjects us to thebusiness risks of our suppliers and subcontractors, which could have a material adverse impact on our operations.          In areas where we depend on third-party suppliers and subcontractors for outsourced products, components or services,we are subject to the risk of customer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of the products or services we sell due to supplier or subcontractor failure. In addition, business difficultiesexperienced by a third-party supplier or subcontractor can lead to the interruption of our ability to obtain outsourced products or services and ultimately our inability to supply products or servicesto our customers. Third-party supplier and subcontractor business interruptions can include, but are not limited to, work stoppages, union negotiations and other labor disputes. Current economicconditions could also impact the ability of suppliers and subcontractors to access credit and, thus, impair their ability to provide us quality products or services in a timely manner, or at all. 13 We may not achieve the expected cost savings and other benefits of our acquisitions.          We strive for and expect to achieve cost savings in connection with our acquisitions, including:(i) manufacturing process and supply chain rationalization, (ii) streamlining redundant administrative overhead and support activities, and (iii) restructuring and repositioningsales and marketing organizations to eliminate redundancies. Cost savings expectations are estimates that are inherently difficult to predict and are necessarily speculative in nature, and we cannotassure you that we will achieve expected, or any, cost savings. In addition, we cannot assure you that unforeseen factors will not offset the estimated cost savings or other benefits from ouracquisitions. As a result, anticipated benefits could be delayed, differ significantly from our estimates and the other information contained in this report, or not be realized. Our failure to successfully complete acquisitions could negatively affect us.          We may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions, which could materially impact our growth rate, results ofoperations, future cash flows and stock price. Our ability to achieve our goals depends upon, among other things, our ability to identify and successfully acquire companies, businesses and productlines, to effectively integrate them and to achieve cost savings. We may also be unable to raise additional funds necessary to consummate these acquisitions. In addition, decreases in our stock pricemay adversely affect our ability to consummate acquisitions. Competition for acquisitions in our business areas may be significant and result in higher prices for businesses, including businesses thatwe may target, which may also affect our acquisition rate or benefits achieved from our acquisitions. Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could have a negative effect on our operations;our acquisitions could cause financial difficulties.          Our acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges,including: Adverse effects on our reported operating results due to charges to earnings, including impairment charges associated with goodwilland other intangibles;  Diversion of management attention from core business operations;  Integration of technology, operations, personnel and financial and other systems;  Increased expenses;  Increased foreign operations, often with unique issues relating to corporate culture, compliance with legal and regulatoryrequirements and other challenges;  Assumption of known and unknown liabilities and exposure to litigation;  Increased levels of debt or dilution to existing shareholders; and  Potential disputes with the sellers of acquired businesses, technology, services or products.         Inaddition, internal controls over financial reporting of acquired companies may not be compliant with required standards. Issues may exist that could rise to the level of significantdeficiencies or, in some cases, material weaknesses, particularly with respect to foreign companies or non-public U.S. companies.         Ourintegration activities may place substantial demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. Customer dissatisfaction or performanceproblems with an acquired business, technology, service or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business. Dispositions or our failure to successfully complete dispositions could negatively affect us.          Our dispositions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, includingdiversion of management attention from running our core businesses, increased expense associated with the dispositions, potential disputes with the customers or suppliers of the disposed businesses,potential disputes with the acquirers of the disposed businesses and a potential dilutive effect on our earnings per share.         Ifdispositions are not completed in a timely manner, there may be a negative effect on our cash flows and/or our ability to execute our strategy. See ""Business,""""MD&A  Results of Discontinued Operations,"" and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for the status of our divestitures. 14 Increases in the number of shares of our outstanding common stock could adversely affect our commonstock price or dilute our earnings per share.          Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock into the public market, or the perception that these salescould occur, could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. As of December 31, 2014, we had the ability to issue up to an additional 2.3 shares as restricted stock shares, restrictedstock units, or stock options under our 2002 Stock Compensation Plan, as amended in 2006, 2011 and 2012, and our 2006 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Incentive Plan. Additionally, we may issue asignificant number of additional shares, in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. We also may issue a significant number of additional shares, either through an existing shelf registrationstatement or through other mechanisms. Additional shares issued would have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share. If the fair value of any of our reporting units is insufficient to recover the carrying value of thegoodwill and other intangibles of the respective reporting unit, a material non-cash charge to earnings could result.          At December 31, 2014, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net, of $2,286.4. We conduct annualimpairment testing to determine if we will be able to recover all or a portion of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. In addition, we review goodwill and indefinite-livedintangible assets for impairment more frequently if impairment indicators arise. If the fair value is insufficient to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, wemay be required to record a material non-cash charge to earnings.         Thefair values of our reporting units generally are based on discounted cash flow projections that are believed to be reasonable under current and forecasted circumstances, the resultsof which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of the reported net assets of our reporting units. Other considerations are also incorporated, including comparable price multiples.Many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets that they serve. Accordingly, we consider estimates and judgments that affect the future cash flow projections,including principal methods of competition such as volume, price, service, product performance and technical innovations and estimates associated with cost reduction initiatives, capacity utilization,and assumptions for inflation and foreign currency changes. We monitor impairment indicators across all of our businesses. Significant changes in market conditions and estimates or judgments used todetermine expected future cash flows that indicate a reduction in carrying value may give, and have given, rise to impairments in the period that the change becomes known. We are subject to work stoppages, union negotiations, labor disputes and other matters associatedwith our labor force, which may adversely impact our operations and cause us to incur incremental costs.          At December 31, 2014, we had over 14,000 employees. Seven domestic collective bargaining agreements coveredapproximately 1,000 employees. We also had various collective labor arrangements as of that date covering certain non-U.S. employee groups. We are subject to potential union campaigns, work stoppages,union negotiations and other potential labor disputes. Further, we may be subject to work stoppages, which are beyond our control, at our suppliers or customers. Our technology is important to our success, and failure to develop new products may result in asignificant competitive disadvantage.          We believe the development of our intellectual property rights is critical to the success of our business. In order tomaintain our market positions and margins, we need to continually develop and introduce high quality, technologically advanced and cost-effective products on a timely basis, in many cases in multiplejurisdictions around the world. The failure to do so could result in a significant competitive disadvantage. Cost reduction actions may affect our business.          Cost reduction actions often result in charges against earnings. These charges can vary significantly from period toperiod and, as a result, we may experience fluctuations in our reported net income and earnings per share due to the timing of restructuring actions. Our current and planned products may contain defects or errors that are detected only after deliveryto customers. If that occurs, our reputation may be harmed and we may face additional costs.          We cannot assure you that our product development, manufacturing and integration testing will be adequate to detect alldefects, errors, failures and quality issues that could impact customer satisfaction or result in claims against us with regard to our products. As a result, we may have, and from time to time havehad, to replace certain components and/or provide 15 remediationin response to the discovery of defects in products that are shipped. The occurrence of any defects, errors, failures or quality issues could result in cancellation of orders, productreturns, diversion of our resources, legal actions by our customers or our customers' end users and other losses to us or to any of our customers or end users, and could also result in the loss of ordelay in market acceptance of our products and loss of sales, which would harm our business and adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Changes in key estimates and assumptions related to our defined benefit pension and postretirementplans, such as discount rates, assumed long-term return on assets, assumed long-term trends of future cost, and accounting and legislative changes, as well as actual investment returns on our pensionplan assets and other actuarial factors, could affect our results of operations and cash flows.          We have defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, including both qualified and non-qualified plans, which covera portion of our salaried and hourly employees and retirees including a portion of our employees and retirees in foreign countries. As of December 31, 2014, these plans were underfunded by$332.7. The determination of funding requirements and pension expense or income associated with these plans involves significant judgment, particularly with respect to discount rates, long-term trendsof future costs and other actuarial assumptions. If our assumptions change significantly due to changes in economic, legislative and/or demographic experience or circumstances, our pension and otherbenefit plans' expense, funded status and our required cash contributions to such plans could be negatively impacted. In addition, returns on plan assets could have a material impact on our pensionplans' expense, funded status and our required contributions to the plans. Changes in regulations or law could also significantly impact our obligations. For example, See ""MD&A Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates"" for the impact that changes in certain assumptions used in the calculation of our costs and obligations associated with these plans could have on ourresults of operations and financial position. Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control ofour company, and accordingly, we may not consummate a transaction that our shareholders consider favorable.          Provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws may inhibit changes in control of our company not approvedby our Board. These provisions include, for example: a staggered board of directors; a prohibition on shareholder action by written consent; a requirement that special shareholder meetings be calledonly by our Chairman, President or Board; advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations; limitations on shareholders' ability to amend, alter or repeal the By-laws; enhancedvoting requirements for certain business combinations involving substantial shareholders; the authority of our Board to issue, without shareholder approval, preferred stock with terms determined inits discretion; and limitations on shareholders' ability to remove directors. In addition, we are afforded the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which couldhave similar effects. In general, Section 203 prohibits us from engaging in a ""business combination"" with an ""interested shareholder"" (each as defined in Section 203) for at least threeyears after the time the person became an interested shareholder unless certain conditions are met. These protective provisions could result in our not consummating a transaction that our shareholdersconsider favorable or discourage entities from attempting to acquire us, potentially at a significant premium to our then-existing stock price. 16"
18,SPXC,SPX CORP,2014-02-21,"ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
     (Allcurrency and share amounts are in millions)         Youshould consider the risks described below and elsewhere in our documents filed with the SEC before investing in any of our securities. We may amend, supplement or add to the riskfactors described below from time to time in future reports filed with the SEC.  Difficulties presented by international economic, political, legal, accounting and business factors could negatively affect our interests and business effort.          We are an increasingly global company, with a significant portion of our sales taking place outside the United States.In 2013, over 50% of our revenues were generated outside the United States. We have placed a particular emphasis on expanding our presence in emerging markets.         Aspart of our strategy, we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide. Our reliance on non-U.S. revenues and non-U.S. manufacturing bases exposes us to a number of risks,including:Significant competition could come from local or long-term participants in non-U.S. markets who may have significantlygreater market knowledge and substantially greater resources than we do; Local customers may have a preference for locally-produced products; Failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws regulating trade, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and otheranti-corruption laws, could result in adverse consequences, including fines, criminal sanctions, or loss of access to markets; Credit risk or financial condition of local customers and distributors could affect our ability to market our products orcollect receivables; Regulatory or political systems or barriers may make it difficult or impossible to enter or remain in new markets. Inaddition, these barriers may impact our existing businesses, including making it more difficult for them to grow; Local political, economic and social conditions, including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions, politicalinstability, or unexpected changes relating to currency could adversely impact our operations; Customs and tariffs may make it difficult or impossible for us to move our products or assets across borders in acost-effective manner; Transportation and shipping expenses add cost to our products; Complications related to shipping, including delays due to weather, labor action or customs, may impact our profit marginsor lead to lost business; Nationalization of private enterprises could harm our business; Government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions such as anti-dumping duties, as well as the imposition of tradesanctions by the United States or the European Union against a class of products imported from or sold and exported to, or the loss of ""normal trade relations"" status with, countries in which weconduct business, could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the United States or Europe or reduce our sales and harm our business;  Environmental and other laws and regulations could increase our costs or limit our ability to run our business;  Our ability to obtain supplies from foreign vendors and ship products internationally may be impaired during times ofcrisis or otherwise; Local, regional or worldwide hostilities could impact our operations; and Distance, language and cultural differences may make it more difficult to manage our business and employees and toeffectively market our products and services.         Factorsaffecting social and economic activity in China, South Africa and other emerging markets or affecting the movement of people and products into and from these countries to ourmajor markets, including North America and Europe, could have a significant negative effect on our operations. 7         Giventhe importance of our international sales and sourcing of manufacturing, the occurrence of any risk described above could have a material adverse effect on our financial position,results of operations or cash flows.  Many of the industries in which we operate are cyclical or are subject to industry events, and our results have been and could be affected as a result.          Many of the business areas in which we operate are subject to general economic cycles or industry events. Certain ofour businesses are subject to specific industry cycles or events, including, but not limited to:The oil and gas, chemical, mining and petrochemical markets; Food and beverage markets; The electric power and infrastructure markets and events; and Contract timing on large construction projects, including food and beverage systems and cooling systems and towers, whichmay cause significant fluctuations in revenues and profits from period to period.         Cyclicalchanges and specific market events could also affect sales of products in our other businesses. Downturns in the business cycles of our different operations may occur at thesame time, which could exacerbate any adverse effects on our business. See ""MD&A  Results of Reportable Segments and Other Operating Segments."" In addition, certain of ourbusinesses have seasonal fluctuations. Historically, some of our key businesses generally tend to be stronger in the second half of the year.  A portion of our revenues is generated through long-term fixed-price contracts, which entail risks including cost overruns, inflation, delays and credit and othercounterparty risks.          A portion of our revenues and earnings is generated through long-term fixed-price contracts, particularly in our FlowTechnology and Thermal Equipment and Services reportable segments. We recognize revenuesfrom certain of these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting whereby revenues and expenses, and thereby profit, in a given period are determined based on our estimates as tothe project status and the costs remaining to complete a particular project.         Estimatesof total revenues and cost at completion are subject to many variables, including the length of time to complete a contract. In addition, contract delays may negatively impactthese estimates and our revenues and earnings results for affected periods.         Tothe extent that we underestimate the remaining cost to complete a project, we may overstate the revenues and profit in a particular period. Further, certain of these contracts providefor penalties or liquidated damages for failure to timely perform our obligations under the contract, or require that we, at our expense, correct and remedy to the satisfaction of the other partycertain defects. Because some of our long-term contracts are at a fixed price, we face the risk that cost overruns or inflation may exceed, erode or eliminate our expected profit margin, or cause usto record a loss on our projects. Additionally, customers of our long-term contracts may suffer financial difficulties that make them unable to pay for a project when completed, or they may decide notor be unable to pay us, either as a matter of corporate decision-making or in response to changes in local laws and regulations. We cannot assure you that expenses or losses for uncollectible amountsrelating to our long-term fixed-price contracts will not have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.  Failure to protect or unauthorized use of our intellectual property may harm our business.          Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtainand use our products or technology. The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology or knowledge, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect ourproprietary rights to the same extent as in the United States. Costs incurred to defend our rights may be material.  If we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted.          We are increasingly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process,transmit and store electronic information. In particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and between ourpersonnel and suppliers and customers. Security breaches of this infrastructure can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. 8 Ifwe are unable to prevent or adequately respond to such breaches, our operations could be disrupted or we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information.  Currency conversion risk could have a material impact on our reported results of business operations.          Our operating results are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of theU.S. dollar against other currencies in which we conduct business could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into U.S. dollars.Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, which may have a material adverse effect on sales or require us tolower our prices, and also decrease our reported revenues or margins related to sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent we are unable or determine not to increase local currency prices.Likewise, decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased overseas.  Worldwide economic conditions could negatively impact our businesses.          Poor macroeconomic conditions could negatively impact our businesses by adversely affecting, among other things,our:Revenues; Margins; Profits; Cash flows; Customers' orders, including order cancellation activity or delays on existing orders;  Customers' ability to access credit; Customers' ability to pay amounts due to us; and Suppliers' and distributors' ability to perform and the availability and costs of materials and subcontracted services.         Whileit is difficult to predict the duration or severity of these conditions, our projections for 2014 assume a generally improving economy. If economic conditions worsen or fail toimprove, our performance could underperform our expectations.  We are subject to laws, regulations and potential liability relating to claims, complaints and proceedings, including those relating to environmental and other matters.          We are subject to various laws, ordinances, regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the UnitedStates and other nations. With respect to acquisitions, divestitures and continuing operations, we may acquire or retain liabilities of which we are not aware, or which are of a different character ormagnitude than expected. Additionally, changes in laws, ordinances, regulations or other governmental policies may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities.         Weface environmental exposures including, for example, those relating to discharges from and materials handled as part of our operations, the remediation of soil and groundwatercontaminated by petroleum products or hazardous substances or wastes, and the health and safety of our employees. We may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardoussubstances or petroleum products on, under, or in our current or formerly owned or leased properties, or from third-party disposal facilities that we may have used, without regard to whether we knewof, or caused, the presence of the contaminants. The presence of, or failure to properly remediate, these substances may have adverse effects, including, for example, substantial investigative orremedial obligations and limitations on the ability to sell or rent affected property or to borrow funds using affected property as collateral. New or existing environmental matters or changes inenvironmental laws or policies could lead to material costs for environmental compliance or cleanup. There can be no assurance that these liabilities and costs will not have a material adverse effecton our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.         Numerousclaims, complaints and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including those relating to litigation matters (e.g., class actions, derivative lawsuitsand contracts, intellectual property and competitive claims), environmental matters, and risk management matters (e.g., product and general liability, automobile, and workers' compensationclaims), have been filed or are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries. From time to time, we face actions by governmental authorities, both in and outside the United States. Additionally,we may become subject to significant claims of which we are currently unaware or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring a significantly greater 9 liabilitythan we anticipate. Our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable (e.g., because of insurer insolvency) to protect us against potential loss exposures.         Wedevote significant time and expense to defend against the various claims, complaints and proceedings brought against us, and we cannot assure you that the expenses or distractionsfrom operating our businesses arising from these defenses will not increase materially.         Wecannot assure you that our accruals and right to indemnity and insurance will be sufficient, that recoveries from insurance or indemnification claims will be available or that any ofour current or future claims or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See ""MD&A  Critical AccountingPolicies and Use of Estimates  Contingent Liabilities.""  Changes in tax laws and regulations or other factors could cause our income tax rate to increase, potentially reducing our net income and adversely affecting our cash flows.          As a global manufacturing company, we are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions around the world. In preparingour financial statements, we calculate our effective income tax rate based on current tax laws and regulations and the estimated taxable income within each of these jurisdictions. Our effective incometax rate, however, may be higher due to numerous factors, including changes in tax laws or regulations. An effective income tax rate significantly higher than our expectations could have an adverseeffect on our business, results of operations and liquidity.         Officialsin some of the jurisdictions in which we do business have proposed, or announced that they are reviewing, tax changes that could potentially increase taxes, and otherrevenue-raising laws and regulations. Any such changes in tax laws or regulations could impose new restrictions, costs or prohibitions on existing practices as well as reduce our net income andadversely affect our cash flows.  The loss of key personnel and an inability to attract and retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations.          We are dependent on the continued services of our leadership team. The loss of these personnel without adequatereplacement could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience in manylocations in order to operate our business successfully. From time to time, there may be a shortage of skilled labor, which may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retainqualified employees. If we were unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals or our costs to do so were to increase significantly, our operations could be materiallyadversely affected.  Our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.          At December 31, 2013, we had $1,675.6 in total indebtedness. On that same date, we had $445.5 of availableborrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities, after giving effect to $54.5 reserved for outstanding letters of credit, and $61.7 of available borrowing capacity under our trade receivablesfinancing arrangement. In addition, at December 31, 2013, we had $328.4 of available issuance capacity under our foreign credit instrument facilities after giving effect to $671.6 reserved foroutstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2013, our cash and equivalents balance was $691.8. See MD&A and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Wemay incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance, or which is assumed in connection with, acquisitions. We may renegotiate or refinance our senior creditfacilities, senior notes or other debt facilities, or enter into additional agreements that have different or more stringent terms. The level of our indebtednesscould:Limit our ability to obtain, or obtain on favorable terms, additional debt financing for working capital, capitalexpenditures or acquisitions; Limit our flexibility in reacting to competitive and other changes in the industry and economic conditions;  Limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock; Coupled with a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows due to economic developments or adverse developments inour business, make it difficult to meet debt service requirements; and Expose us to interest rate fluctuations to the extent existing borrowings are, and any new borrowings may be, at variablerates of interest, which could result in higher interest expense and interest payments in the event of increases in interest rates. 10         Ourability to make scheduled payments of principal or pay interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operatingperformance, which may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors beyond our control. In addition, we cannot assure you that futureborrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, whether in the ordinary course of business or upon anacceleration of such indebtedness, we may pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures,revising implementation of or delaying strategic plans or seeking additional equity capital. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results ofoperations and stock price. In addition, we cannot assure that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements, orthat these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements.         Numerousbanks in many countries are syndicate members in our credit facility. Failure of one or more of our larger lenders, or several of our smaller lenders, could significantly reduceavailability of our credit, which could harm our liquidity.  We may not be able to finance future needs or adapt our business plan to react to changes in economic or business conditions because of restrictions placed on us by oursenior credit facilities and any existing or future instruments governing our other indebtedness.          Our senior credit facilities, the indentures governing our senior notes and agreements governing our other indebtednesscontain, or future or revised instruments may contain, various restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unless certainfinancial tests or other criteria are satisfied. We also must comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests. Our subsidiaries may also be subject to restrictions on their ability to makedistributions to us. In addition, our senior credit facilities, indentures governing our senior notes and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain or may contain additional affirmative andnegative covenants. Material existing restrictions are described more fully in the MD&A and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. Each of these restrictions could affect our abilityto operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities, such as acquisitions.         Ifwe do not comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our senior credit facilities, indentures governing our senior notes and agreements governing our other indebtedness,we could default under those agreements, and the debt, together with accrued interest, could be declared due and payable. If we default under our senior credit facilities, the lenders could cause allour outstanding debt obligations under our senior credit facilities to become due and payable orrequire us to repay the indebtedness under these facilities. If our debt is accelerated, we may not be able to repay or refinance our debt. In addition, any default under our senior credit facilities,indentures governing our senior notes or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-defaultprovisions. If the indebtedness under our senior credit facilities is accelerated, we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due under our senior credit facilities, senior notes or other debtsecurities then outstanding. Our ability to comply with these provisions of our senior credit facilities, indentures governing our senior notes and agreements governing our other indebtedness will beaffected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control. Complying with our covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to us and may makeit more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete, including against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.  The price and availability of raw materials may adversely affect our results.          We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including inflation in the prices and shortages of raw materials. Inrecent years, we have faced significant volatility in the prices of many of our key raw materials, including petroleum-based products, steel and copper. Increases in the prices of raw materials orshortages or allocations of materials may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as we may not be able to pass cost increases on to ourcustomers, or our sales may be reduced. We are subject to long-term supplier contracts that may increase our exposure to pricing fluctuations.  We may not achieve the expected cost savings and other benefits of our acquisitions.          We strive for and expect to achieve cost savings in connection with our acquisitions, including:(i) manufacturing process and supply chain rationalization, (ii) streamlining redundant administrative overhead and support activities, and (iii) restructuring and repositioningsales and marketing organizations to eliminate redundancies. Cost savings expectations are estimates that are inherently difficult to predict and are necessarily speculative in nature, and we cannotassure you that we 11 willachieve expected, or any, cost savings. In addition, we cannot assure you that unforeseen factors will not offset the estimated cost savings or other benefits from our acquisitions. As a result,anticipated benefits could be delayed, differ significantly from our estimates and the other information contained in this report, or not be realized.  Our failure to successfully complete acquisitions could negatively affect us.          We may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions, which could materially impact our growth rate, results ofoperations, future cash flows and stock price. Our ability to achieve our goals depends upon, among other things, our ability to identify and successfully acquire companies, businesses and productlines, to effectively integrate them and to achieve cost savings. We may also be unable to raise additional funds necessary to consummate these acquisitions. In addition, decreases in our stock pricemay adversely affect our ability to consummate acquisitions. Competition for acquisitions in our business areas may be significant and result in higher prices for businesses, including businesses thatwe may target, which may also affect our acquisition rate or benefits achieved from our acquisitions.  Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could have a negative effect on our operations; our acquisitions could cause financial difficulties.          Our acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges,including:Adverse effects on our reported operating results due to charges to earnings, including impairment charges associated withgoodwill and other intangibles; Diversion of management attention from core business operations; Integration of technology, operations, personnel and financial and other systems;  Increased expenses; Increased foreign operations, often with unique issues relating to corporate culture, compliance with legal and regulatoryrequirements and other challenges; Assumption of known and unknown liabilities and exposure to litigation; Increased levels of debt or dilution to existing shareholders; and Potential disputes with the sellers of acquired businesses, technology, services or products.         Inaddition, internal controls over financial reporting of acquired companies may not be compliant with required standards. Issues may exist that could rise to the level of significantdeficiencies or, in some cases, material weaknesses, particularly with respect to foreign companies or non-public U.S. companies.         Ourintegration activities may place substantial demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. Customer dissatisfaction or performanceproblems with an acquired business, technology, service or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.  We operate in highly competitive industries. Our failure to compete effectively could harm our business.          We operate in a highly competitive environment, competing on the basis of product offerings, technical capabilities,quality, service and pricing. We have a number of competitors with substantial technological and financial resources, brand recognition and established relationships with global service providers.Some of our competitors have low cost structures, support from local governments, or both. In addition, new competitors may enter the industry. Competitors may be able to offer lower prices,additional products or services or a more attractive mix of products or services, or services or other incentives that we cannot or will not match. These competitors may be in a stronger position torespond quickly to new or emerging technologies and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, and make more attractive offers to potential customers, employees and strategicpartners.  Our strategy to outsource various elements of the products we sell subjects us to the business risks of our suppliers, which could have a material adverse impact on ouroperations.          In areas where we depend on third-party suppliers for outsourced products or components, we are subject to the risk ofcustomer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of the products we sell due to supplier failure. In addition, business difficulties experienced by a third-party supplier can lead to theinterruption of our ability to obtain the outsourced product and ultimately our inability to supply products to our customers. Third-party supplier business interruptions can include, but are not 12 limitedto, work stoppages and union negotiations and other labor disputes. Current economic conditions could impact the ability of suppliers to access credit and thus impair their ability to provideus quality product in a timely manner, or at all.  Dispositions or our failure to successfully complete dispositions could negatively affect us.          Our dispositions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, includingdiversion of management attention from running our core businesses, increased expense associated with the dispositions, potential disputes with the customers or suppliers of the disposed businesses,potential disputes with the acquirers of the disposed businesses and a potential dilutive effect on our earnings per share. If dispositions are not completed in a timely manner, there may be anegative effect on our cash flows and/or our ability to execute our strategy. See ""Business,"" ""MD&A  Results of Discontinued Operations,"" and Note 4 to our consolidatedfinancial statements for the status of our divestitures.  Increases in the number of shares of our outstanding common stock could adversely affect our common stock price or dilute our earnings per share.          Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock into the public market, or the perception that these salescould occur, could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. As of December 31, 2013, we had the ability to issue up to an additional 2.7 shares as restricted stock shares, restrictedstock units, or stock options under our 2002 Stock Compensation Plan, as amended in 2006, 2011 and 2012, and our 2006 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Incentive Plan. Additionally, we may issue asignificant number of additional shares, in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. We also may issue a significant number of additional shares, either through an existing shelf registrationstatement or through other mechanisms. Additional shares issued would have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share.  If the fair value of any of our reporting units is insufficient to recover the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangibles of the respective reporting unit, amaterial non-cash charge to earnings could result.          At December 31, 2013, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net, of $2,441.7. We conduct annualimpairment testing to determine if we will be able to recover all or a portion of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. In addition, we review goodwill and indefinite-livedintangible assets forimpairment more frequently if impairment indicators arise. If the fair value is insufficient to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, we may be required torecord a material non-cash charge to earnings.         Thefair values of our reporting units generally are based on discounted cash flow projections that are believed to be reasonable under current and forecasted circumstances, the resultsof which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of the reported net assets of our reporting units. Other considerations are also incorporated, including comparable industry pricemultiples. Many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets that they serve. Accordingly, we consider estimates and judgments that affect the future cash flowprojections, including principal methods of competition such as volume, price, service, product performance and technical innovations and estimates associated with cost reduction initiatives, capacityutilization, and assumptions for inflation and foreign currency changes. We monitor impairment indicators across all of our businesses. Significant changes in market conditions and estimates orjudgments used to determine expected future cash flows that indicate a reduction in carrying value may give, and have given, rise to impairments in the period that the change becomes known.  We are subject to work stoppages, union negotiations, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force, which may adversely impact our operations and causeus to incur incremental costs.          At December 31, 2013, we had over 14,000 employees. Ten domestic collective bargaining agreements coverapproximately 1,100 employees. We also have various collective labor arrangements covering certain non-U.S. employee groups. We are subject to potential union campaigns, work stoppages, unionnegotiations and other potential labor disputes. Further, we may be subject to work stoppages, which are beyond our control, at our suppliers or customers.  Our technology is important to our success, and failure to develop new products may result in a significant competitive disadvantage.          We believe the development of our intellectual property rights is critical to the success of our business. In order tomaintain our market positions and margins, we need to continually develop and introduce high quality, technologically advanced and cost-effective products on a timely basis, in many cases in multiplejurisdictions around the world. The failure to do so could result in a significant competitive disadvantage. 13  Cost reduction actions may affect our business.          Cost reduction actions often result in charges against earnings. These charges can vary significantly from period toperiod and, as a result, we may experience fluctuations in our reported net income and earnings per share due to the timing of restructuring actions.  Our current and planned products may contain defects or errors that are detected only after delivery to customers. If that occurs, our reputation may be harmed and we mayface additional costs.          We cannot assure you that our product development, manufacturing and integration testing will be adequate to detect alldefects, errors, failures and quality issues that could impact customer satisfaction or result in claims against us with regard to our products. As a result, we may have, and from time to time havehad, to replace certain components and/or provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects in products that are shipped. The occurrence of any defects, errors, failures or quality issuescould result in cancellation of orders, product returns, diversion of our resources, legal actions by our customers or our customers' end users and other losses to us or to any of our customers or endusers, and could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and loss of sales, which would harm our business and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.  Changes in key estimates and assumptions related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, such as discount rates, assumed long-term return on assets, assumedlong-term trends of future cost, and accounting and legislative changes, as well as actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and other actuarial factors, could affect our results ofoperations and cash flows.          We have defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, including both qualified and non-qualified plans, which covera portion of our salaried and hourly employees and retirees including a portion of our employees and retirees in foreign countries. As of December 31, 2013, these plans were underfunded by$265.5. The determination of funding requirements and pension expense or income associated with these plans involves significant judgment, particularly with respect to discount rates, long-term trendsof future costs and other actuarial assumptions. If our assumptions change significantly due to changes in economic, legislative and/or demographic experience or circumstances, our pension and otherbenefit plans' expense, funded status and our cash contributions to such plans could be negatively impacted. In addition, returns on plan assets could have a material impact on our pension plans'expense, funded status and our required contributions to the plans. Changes in regulations or law could also significantly impact our obligations. For example, See ""MD&A  CriticalAccounting Policies and Use of Estimates"" for the impact that changes in certain assumptions used in the calculation of our costs and obligations associated with these plans could have on our resultsof operations and financial position.  Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company, and accordingly, we may not consummate a transaction that ourshareholders consider favorable.          Provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws may inhibit changes in control of our company not approvedby our Board. These provisions include, for example: a staggered board of directors; a prohibition on shareholder action by written consent; a requirement that special shareholder meetings be calledonly by our Chairman, President or Board; advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations; limitations on shareholders' ability to amend, alter or repeal the By-laws; enhancedvoting requirements for certain business combinations involving substantial shareholders; the authority of our Board to issue, without shareholder approval, preferred stock with terms determined inits discretion; and limitations on shareholders' ability to remove directors. In addition, we are afforded the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which couldhave similar effects. In general, Section 203 prohibits us from engaging in a ""business combination"" with an ""interested shareholder"" (each as defined in Section 203) for at least threeyears after the time the person became an interested shareholder unless certain conditions are met. These protective provisions could result in our not consummating a transaction that our shareholdersconsider favorable or discourage entities from attempting to acquire us, potentially at a significant premium to our then-existing stock price. 14"
1,SPXC,SPX CORP,2013-02-22,"ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
     (Allcurrency and share amounts are in millions)         Youshould consider the risks described below and elsewhere in our documents filed with the SEC before investing in any of our securities. We may amend, supplement or add to the riskfactors described below from time to time in future reports filed with the SEC.  Difficulties presented by international economic, political, legal, accounting and business factors could negatively affect our interests and business effort.          We are an increasingly global company, with a significant portion of our sales taking place outside the United States.In 2012, over 50% of our revenues were generated outside the United States and we expect that over 50% of our revenues will be generated outside the United States in 2013. We have placed a particularemphasis on expanding our presence in emerging markets.         Aspart of our strategy, we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide. Our reliance on non-U.S. revenues and non-U.S. manufacturing bases exposesus to a number of risks, including:Significant competition could come from local or long-term participants in non-U.S. markets whomay have significantly greater market knowledge and substantially greater resources than we do; Credit risk or financial condition of local customers and distributors could affect our ability to market our products orcollect receivables; Local customers may have a preference for locally-produced products; Failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws regulating trade, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,and other anti-corruption laws, could result in adverse consequences, including fines, criminal sanctions, or loss of access to markets; Regulatory or political systems or barriers may make it difficult or impossible to enter or remain in new markets. Inaddition, these barriers may impact our existing businesses, including making it more difficult for them to grow; Local political, economic and social conditions, including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions and politicalinstability could adversely impact our operations; Domestic and foreign customs and tariffs may make it difficult or impossible for us to move our products or assets acrossborders in a cost-effective manner; Transportation and shipping expenses add cost to our products; Complications related to shipping, including delays due to weather, labor action, or customs, may impact our profitmargins or lead to lost business; Nationalization of private enterprises could harm our business; Government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions such as anti-dumping duties, as well as the imposition oftrade sanctions by the United States or the European Union against a class of products imported by us from, sold by us and exported to, or the loss of ""normal trade relations"" status with, countriesin which we conduct business could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the United States or Europe or reduce our sales and harm our business;  Environmental and other laws and regulations could increase our costs or limit our ability to run our business;  Our ability to obtain supplies from foreign vendors and ship products internationally may be impaired during times ofcrisis or otherwise; Local, regional or worldwide hostilities could impact our operations; andDistance, language and cultural differences may make it more difficult to manage the business and employees, and toeffectively market our products and services.         Factorsaffecting social and economic activity in China, South Africa and other emerging markets or affecting the movement of people and products into and from these countries to ourmajor markets, including North America and Europe, could have a significant negative effect on our operations. 7 Table of Contents        Giventhe importance of our international sales and sourcing of manufacturing, the occurrence of any risk described above could have a material adverse effect on our financial position,results of operations or cash flows.  Many of the industries in which we operate are cyclical or are subject to industry events, and our results have been and could be affected as a result.          Many of the business areas in which we operate are subject to general economic cycles or industry events. Certain ofour businesses are subject to specific industry cycles or events, including, but not limited to:The oil and gas, chemical, mining and petrochemical markets; Food and beverage markets; The electric power and infrastructure markets and events; and The correlation between demand for cooling systems and towers and contract timing on large construction projects, whichmay cause significant fluctuations in revenues and profits from period to period.         Cyclicalchanges and specific market events could also affect sales of products in our other businesses. The downturns in the business cycles of our different operations may occur at thesame time, which could exacerbate any adverseeffects on our business. See ""MD&A  Results of Reportable Segments and Other Operating Segments."" In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal fluctuations. Historically,our businesses generally tend to be stronger in the second half of the year.  A portion of our revenues is generated through long-term fixed-price contracts, which entail risks including cost overruns, inflation, delays and credit andother counterparty risks.          A portion of our revenues and earnings is generated through long-term fixed-price contracts, particularlyin our Flow Technology and Thermal Equipment and Services reportable segments. We recognize revenues from certain of these contracts using the percentage-of-completion methodof accounting whereby revenues and expenses, and thereby profit, in a given period are determined based on our estimates as to the project status and the costs remaining to complete a particularproject.         Estimatesof total revenues and cost at completion are subject to many variables, including the length of time to complete a contract. In addition, contract delays may negatively impactthese estimates and our revenues and earnings results for affected periods.         Tothe extent that we underestimate the remaining cost to complete a project, we may overstate the revenues and profit in a particular period. Further, certain of these contracts providefor penalties or liquidated damages for failure to timely perform our obligations under the contract, or require that we, at our expense, correct and remedy to the satisfaction of the other partycertain defects. Because some of our long-term contracts are at a fixed price, we face the risk that cost overruns or inflation may exceed, erode or eliminate our expected profit margin,or cause us to record a loss on our projects. Additionally, customers of our long-term contracts may suffer financial difficulties that make them unable to pay for a project whencompleted, or they may decide not to pay us, either as a matter of corporate decision-making or in response to changes in local laws and regulations. We cannot assure you that expenses or losses foruncollectible amounts relating to our long-term fixed-price contracts will not have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings.  Failure to protect or unauthorized use of our intellectual property may harm our business.          Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtainand use our products or technology. The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology or knowledge, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect ourproprietary rights as fully as in the United States. Expenses in connection with defending our rights may be material.  If we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted.          We are increasingly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process,transmit and store electronic information. In particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and between ourpersonnel and suppliers and customers. Security breaches of this infrastructure can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If we are unable toprevent or adequately respond to such breaches, our operations could be disrupted or we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information. 8 Table of Contents Currency conversion risk could have a material impact on our reported results of business operations.          Our operating results are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of theU.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into U.S. dollars. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increasethe effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, which may have a material adverse effect on sales or require us to lower our prices, and also decrease our reportedrevenues or margins in respect of sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent we are unable or determine not to increase local currency prices. Likewise, decreased strength of the U.S. dollarcould have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased overseas.  Worldwide economic conditions could negatively impact our businesses.          The general worldwide depressed economic conditions that began in 2008 continue to affect many industries, includingindustries in which we or our customers operate. These conditions could negatively impact our businesses by adversely affecting, among other things,our:Revenues; Profits; Margins; Cash flows; Suppliers' and distributors' ability to perform and the availability and costs of materials and subcontracted services;  Customers' orders; Order cancellation activity or delays on existing orders; Customers' ability to access credit; andCustomers' ability to pay amounts due to us.         Whileit is difficult to predict the duration or severity of these conditions, our projections for 2013 assume a generally improving economy. If economic conditions fail to improve, thenegative impact on our businesses could increase or continue for longer than we expect. See MD&A for further discussion of how these conditions have affected our businesses to date and how they mayaffect them in the future.  Our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.          At December 31, 2012, we had $1,692.0 in total indebtedness. On that same date, we had $533.6 of availableborrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities after giving effect to $66.4 reserved for outstanding letters of credit and $46.3 of available borrowing capacity under our trade receivablesfinancing arrangement. In addition, at December 31, 2012, we had $414.3 of available issuance capacity under our foreign trade facility after giving effect to $785.7 reserved for outstandingletters of credit. At December 31, 2012, our cash and equivalents balance was $984.1. See MD&A and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. We may incuradditional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance, or which is assumed in connection with, acquisitions. We may renegotiate or refinance our senior credit facilities,senior notes or other debt facilities, or enter into additional agreements that have different or more stringent terms. The level of our indebtedness could:Limit our ability to obtain, or obtain on favorable terms, additional debt financing for working capital, capitalexpenditures or acquisitions; Limit our flexibility in reacting to competitive and other changes in the industry and economic conditions;  Limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock; Coupled with a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows due to economic developments or adverse developments inour business, make it difficult to meet debt service requirements; andExpose us to interest rate fluctuations to the extent existing borrowings are, and any new borrowings may be, at variablerates of interest, which could result in higher interest expense and interest payments in the event of increases in interest rates. 9 Table of Contents        Ourability to make scheduled payments of principal or pay interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operatingperformance, which may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors beyond our control. In addition, we cannot assure that futureborrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, whether in the ordinary course of business or upon anacceleration of such indebtedness, we may pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures,revising implementation of or delaying strategic plans or seeking additional equity capital. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results ofoperations and stock price. In addition, we cannot assure that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements, orthat these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements.         Numerousbanks in many countries are syndicate members in our credit facility. Failure of one or more of our larger lenders, or several of our smaller lenders, could significantly reduceavailability of our credit, which could harm our liquidity.  We may not be able to finance future needs or adapt our business plan to react to changes in economic or business conditions because of restrictions placed on us by oursenior credit facilities and any existing or future instruments governing our other indebtedness.          Our senior credit facilities, the indentures governing our senior notes and agreements governing our other indebtednesscontain, or future or revised instruments may contain, a number of restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unlesscertain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied. We also must comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests. Our subsidiaries may also be subject to restrictions on their ability tomake distributions to us. In addition, our senior credit facilities, indentures governing our senior notes and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain or may contain additional affirmativeand negative covenants. Existing restrictions are described more fully in the MD&A and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. Each of these restrictions could affect our ability tooperate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities, such as acquisitions.         Ifwe do not comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our senior credit facilities, indentures governing our senior notes and agreements governing our other indebtedness,we could be in default under those agreements, and the debt, together with accrued interest, could then be declared immediately due and payable. If we default under our senior credit facilities, thelenders could cause all our outstanding debt obligations under our senior credit facilities to become due and payable or require us to apply all of our cash to repay the indebtedness we owe. If ourdebt is accelerated, we may not be able to repay or refinance our debt. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Inaddition, any default under our senior credit facilities, indentures governing our senior notes or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debtinstruments that contain cross- acceleration or cross-default provisions. If the indebtedness under our senior credit facilities is accelerated, we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts dueunder our senior credit facilities, senior notes or other debt securities then outstanding. Our ability to comply with these provisions of our senior credit facilities, indentures governing our seniornotes and agreements governing our other indebtedness will be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control. Complying with our covenants may also causeus to take actions that are not favorable to us and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete, including against companies that are not subject tosuch restrictions.  Changes in tax laws and regulations or other factors could cause our income tax rate to increase, potentially reducing our net income and adversely affecting our cash flows.          As a global manufacturing company, we are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions around the world. In preparingour financial statements, we calculate our effective income tax rate based on current tax laws and regulations and the estimated taxable income within each of these jurisdictions. Our effective incometax rate, however, may be higher due to numerous factors, including changes in tax laws or regulations. An effective income tax rate significantly higher than our expectations could have an adverseeffect on our business, results of operations and liquidity.         Officialsin some of the jurisdictions in which we do business have proposed, or announced that they are reviewing, tax changes that could potentially increase taxes, and otherrevenue-raising laws and regulations. Any such changes in tax laws or regulations could impose new restrictions, costs or prohibitions on existing practices as well as reduce our net income andadversely affect our cash flows. 10 Table of Contents We are subject to laws, regulations and potential liability relating to claims, complaints and proceedings, including those relating to environmental and other matters.          We are subject to various laws, ordinances, regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the UnitedStates and other nations. With respect to acquisitions, divestitures and continuing operations, we may acquire or retain liabilities of which we are not aware, or of a different character or magnitudethan expected. Additionally, changes in laws, ordinances, regulations or other governmental policies may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities.         Weface environmental exposures including, for example, those relating to discharges from and materials handled as part of our operations, the remediation of soil and groundwatercontaminated by petroleum products or hazardous substances or wastes, and the health and safety of our employees. We may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardoussubstances or petroleum products on, under, or in our current or formerly owned or leased property, or from a third-party disposal facility that we may have used, without regard to whether we knew of,or caused, the presence of the contaminants. The presence of, or failure to properly remediate, these substances may have adverse effects, including, for example, substantial investigative or remedialobligations and limitations on the ability to sell or rent affected property or to borrow funds using affected property as collateral. New or existing environmental matters or changes in environmentallaws or policies could lead to material costs for environmental compliance or cleanup. There can be no assurance that these liabilities and costs will not have a material adverse effect on ourfinancial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.         Numerousclaims, complaints and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including those relating to litigation matters (e.g., class actions, derivative lawsuitsand contracts, intellectual property and competitive claims), environmental matters, and risk management matters (e.g., product and general liability, automobile, and workers' compensationclaims), have been filed or are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries. From time to time, we face actions by governmental authorities, both in and outside the United States. Additionally,we may become subject to significant claims of which we are currently unaware or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring a significantly greater liability than we anticipate. Ourinsurance may be insufficient or unavailable (e.g., because of insurer insolvency) to protect us against potential loss exposures.         Wedevote significant time and expense to defend against the various claims, complaints and proceedings brought against us, and we cannot assure you that the expenses or distractionsfrom operating our businesses arising from these defenses will not increase materially.         Wecannot assure you that our accruals and right to indemnity and insurance will be sufficient, that recoveries from insurance or indemnification claims will be available or that any ofour current or future claims or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See ""MD&A  Critical AccountingPolicies and Use of Estimates  Contingent Liabilities.""  Changes in key estimates and assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed long-term return on assets, assumed long-term trends of future cost, andaccounting and legislative changes, as well as actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and other actuarial factors, could affect our results of operations and cash flows.          We have defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, including both qualified and non-qualified plans,which cover a portion of our salaried and hourly employees and retirees including a portion of our employees and retirees in foreign countries. As of December 31, 2012, these plans wereunderfunded by $603.7. The determination of funding requirements and pension expense or income associated with these plans involves significant judgment, particularly with respect to discount rates,long-term returns on assets, long-term trends of future costs and other actuarial assumptions. If our assumptions change significantly due to changes in economic, legislativeand/or demographic experience or circumstances, our pension and other benefit plans' expense, funded status and our cash contributions to such plans could be negatively impacted. In addition, thedifference between our actual investment returns and our long-term return on assets assumptions could result in a change to our pension plans' expense, funded status and our requiredcontributions to the plans. Changes in regulations or law could also significantly impact our obligations. For example, See ""MD&A  Critical Accounting Policies and Use ofEstimates"" for the impact that changes in certain assumptions used in the calculation of our costs and obligations associated with these plans could have on our results of operations and financialposition.  The price and availability of raw materials may adversely affect our results.          We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including inflation in the prices and shortages of raw materials. Inrecent years, we have faced significant volatility in the prices of many of our key raw materials, including petroleum-based products, steel and 11 Table of Contentscopper.Increases in the prices of raw materials or shortages or allocations of materials may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as we maynot be able to pass cost increases on to our customers, or our sales may be reduced. We are subject to long-term supplier contracts that may increase our exposure to pricing fluctuations.  We may not achieve the expected cost savings and other benefits of our acquisitions.          We strive for and expect to achieve cost savings in connection with our acquisitions, including:(i) manufacturing process and supply chain rationalization, (ii) streamlining redundant administrative overhead and support activities, and (iii) restructuring and repositioningsales and marketing organizations to eliminate redundancies. Cost savings expectations are estimates that are inherently difficult to predict and are necessarily speculative in nature, and we cannotassure you that we will achieve expected, or any, cost savings. In addition, we cannot assure you that unforeseen factors will not offset the estimated cost savings or other benefits from ouracquisitions. As a result, anticipated benefits could be delayed, differ significantly from our estimates and the other information contained in this report, or not be realized.  Our failure to successfully complete acquisitions could negatively affect us.          We may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions, which could materially impact our growth rate, results ofoperations, future cash flows and stock price. Our ability to achieve our goals depends upon, among other things, our ability to identify and successfully acquire companies, businesses and productlines, to effectively integrate them and to achieve cost effectiveness. We may also be unable to raise any additional funds necessary to consummate these acquisitions. In addition, decreases in ourstock price may adversely affect our ability to consummate acquisitions. Competition for acquisitions in our business areas may be significant and result in higher prices for businesses, includingbusinesses that we may target, which may also affect our acquisition rate or benefits achieved from our acquisitions.  Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could have a negative effect on our operations; our acquisitions could cause financial difficulties.          Our acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges,including:Adverse effects on our reported operating results due to charges to earnings, including impairment charges associated withgoodwill and other intangibles; Diversion of management attention from running our businesses; Integration of technology, operations, personnel and financial and other systems;  Increased expenses; Increased foreign operations, often with unique issues relating to corporate culture, compliance with legal and regulatoryrequirements and other challenges; Assumption of known and unknown liabilities and exposure to litigation; Increased levels of debt or dilution to existing shareholders; andPotential disputes with the sellers of acquired businesses, technology, services or products.         Inaddition, internal controls over financial reporting of acquired companies may not be up to required standards. Issues may exist that could rise to the level of significantdeficiencies or, in some cases, material weaknesses, particularly with respect to foreign companies or non-public U.S. companies.         Ourintegration activities may place substantial demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. Customer dissatisfaction or performanceproblems with an acquired business, technology, service or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.  We operate in highly competitive industries. Our failure to compete effectively could harm our business.          We operate in a highly competitive environment, competing on the basis of product offerings, technical capabilities,quality, service and pricing. We have a number of competitors with substantial technological and financial resources, brand recognition and established relationships with global service providers.Some of our competitors have low cost structures, support from governments in their home countries, or both. Inaddition, new competitors may enter the industry. Competitors may be able to offer lower prices, additional products or services or a more attractive mix of products or services, or services or 12 Table of Contentsotherincentives that we cannot or will not match. These competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new or emerging technologies and may be able to undertake more extensivemarketing campaigns, and make more attractive offers to potential customers, employees and strategic partners.  Our strategy to outsource various elements of the products we sell subjects us to the business risks of our suppliers, which could have a material adverse impact on ouroperations.          In areas where we depend on third-party suppliers for outsourced products or components, we are subject to the risk ofcustomer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of the products we sell due to supplier failure. In addition, business difficulties experienced by a third-party supplier can lead to theinterruption of our ability to obtain the outsourced product and ultimately our inability to supply products to our customers. Third-party supplier business interruptions can include, but are notlimited to, work stoppages and union negotiations and other labor disputes. Current economic conditions could impact the ability of suppliers to access credit and thus impair their ability to provideus quality product in a timely manner, or at all.  Dispositions or our failure to successfully complete dispositions could negatively affect us.          Our dispositions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, includingdiversion of management attention from running our core businesses, increased expense associated with the dispositions, potential disputes with the customers or suppliers of the disposed businesses,potential disputes with the acquirers of the disposed businesses and a potential dilutive effect on our earnings per share. If dispositions are not completed in a timely manner, there may be anegative effect on our cash flows and/or our ability to execute our strategy. See ""Business,"" ""MD&A  Results of Discontinued Operations,"" and Note 4 to our consolidatedfinancial statements for the status of our divestitures.  Increases in the number of shares of our outstanding common stock could adversely affect our common stock price or dilute our earnings per share.          Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock into the public market, or the perception that these salescould occur, could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. As of December 31, 2012, we had the ability to issue up to an additional 3.5 shares as restricted stock, restricted stockunits, or stock optionsunder our 2002 Stock Compensation Plan, as amended in 2006. Additionally, we may issue a significant number of additional shares, in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. We also may issue asignificant number of additional shares, either through an existing shelf registration statement or through other mechanisms. Additional shares issued would have a dilutive effect on our earnings pershare.  The loss of key personnel and an inability to attract and retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations.          We are dependent on the continued services of our leadership team. The loss of these personnel without adequatereplacement could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience in manylocations in order to operate our business successfully. From time to time, there may be a shortage of skilled labor, which may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retainqualified employees. If we were unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals or our costs to do so were to increase significantly, our operations could be materiallyadversely affected.  If the fair value of any of our reporting units is insufficient to recover the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangibles of the respective reporting unit, amaterial non-cash charge to earnings could result.          At December 31, 2012, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net of $2,536.4. We conduct annual impairmenttesting to determine if we will be able to recover all or a portion of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. In addition, we review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibleassets for impairment more frequently if impairment indicators arise. If the fair value is insufficient to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, we may berequired to record a material non-cash charge to earnings.         Thefair values of our reporting units generally are based on discounted cash flow projections that are believed to be reasonable under current and forecasted circumstances, the resultsof which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of the reported net assets of our reporting units. Other considerations are also incorporated, including comparable industry pricemultiples. Many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets that they serve. Accordingly, we consider estimates and judgments that affect the future cash flowprojections, including principal methods of competition such as volume, price, service, product performance and technical innovations and estimates associated with cost improvement initiatives,capacity utilization, and assumptions for inflation and foreign currency changes. 13 Table of ContentsWemonitor impairment indicators across all of our businesses. Significant changes in market conditions and estimates or judgments used to determine expected future cash flows that indicate areduction in carrying value may give, and have given, rise to impairments in the period that the change becomes known.  We are subject to work stoppages, union negotiations, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force, which may adversely impact our operations and causeus to incur incremental costs.          At December 31, 2012, we had approximately 15,000 employees. Ten domestic collective bargaining agreements coverapproximately 1,100 employees. We also have various collective labor arrangements covering certain non-U.S. employee groups. We are subject to potential union campaigns, work stoppages,union negotiations and other potential labor disputes. Further, we may be subject to work stoppages, which are beyond our control, at our suppliers or customers.  Our technology is important to our success, and failure to develop new products may result in a significant competitive disadvantage.          We believe the development of our intellectual property rights is critical to the success of our business. In order tomaintain our market positions and margins, we need to continually develop and introduce high quality, technologically advanced and cost effective products on a timely basis, in many cases in multiplejurisdictions around the world. The failure to do so could result in a significant competitive disadvantage.  Cost reduction actions may affect our business.          Cost reduction actions often result in charges against earnings. These charges can vary significantly from period toperiod and, as a result, we may experience fluctuations in our reported net income and earnings per share due to the timing of restructuring actions, which in turn can have a material adverse effecton our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Our current and planned products may contain defects or errors that are detected only after delivery to customers. If that occurs, our reputation may be harmed and we mayface additional costs.          We cannot assure you that our product development, manufacturing and integration testing will be adequate to detect alldefects, errors, failures and quality issues that could impact customer satisfaction or result in claims against us with regard to our products. As a result, we may have, and from time to time havehad, to replace certain components and/or provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects in products that are shipped. The occurrence of any defects, errors, failures or quality issuescould result in cancellation of orders, product returns, diversion of our resources, legal actions by our customers or our customers' end users and other losses to us or to our customers or end users,and could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and loss of sales, which would harm our business and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.  Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company, and accordingly, we may not consummate a transaction that ourshareholders consider favorable.          Provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws may inhibit changes in control of our companynot approved by our Board. These provisions include, for example: a staggered board of directors; a prohibition on shareholder action by written consent; a requirement that special shareholdermeetings be called only by our Chairman, President or Board; advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations; limitations on shareholders' ability to amend, alter or repeal theBy-laws; enhanced voting requirements for certain business combinations involving substantial shareholders; the authority of our Board to issue, without shareholder approval, preferredstock with terms determined in its discretion; and limitations on shareholders' ability to remove directors. In addition, we are afforded the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware GeneralCorporation Law, which could have similar effects. In general, Section 203 prohibits us from engaging in a ""business combination"" with an ""interested shareholder"" (each as defined inSection 203) for at least three years after the time the person became an interested shareholder unless certain conditions are met. These protective provisions could result in our notconsummating a transaction that our shareholders consider favorable or discourage entities from attempting to acquire us, potentially at a significant premium to our then-existing stockprice. 14 Table of Contents"
11,SPXC,SPX CORP,2012-02-24,"ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
     (Allcurrency and share amounts are in millions, except per share data)         Youshould consider the risks described below and elsewhere in our documents filed with the SEC before investing in any of our securities. We may amend, supplement or add to the riskfactors described below from time to time in future reports filed with the SEC.  Many of the industries in which we operate are cyclical or are subject to industry events, and our results have been and could be affected as a result.          Many of the business areas in which we operate are subject to general economic cycles or industry events. Certain ofour businesses are subject to specific industry cycles or events, including, but not limited to:The oil and gas, chemical, mining and petrochemical markets; Food and beverage markets; Decisions made by automotive manufacturers and franchise dealers; The electric power and infrastructure markets and events; and The correlation between demand for cooling systems and towers and contract timing on large construction projects, whichmay cause significant fluctuations in revenues and profits from period to period.         Cyclicalchanges and specific market events could also affect sales of products in our other businesses. The downturns in the business cycles of our different operations may occur at thesame time, which could exacerbate any adverse effects on our business. See ""MD&A  Segment Results of Operations."" In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal fluctuations.Historically, our businesses generally tend to be stronger in the second half of the year.  Difficulties presented by international economic, political, legal, accounting and business factors could negatively affect our interests and business effort.          We are an increasingly global company, with a significant portion of our sales taking place outside the United States.In 2011, over 50% of our revenues were generated outside the United States and we expect that over 50% of our revenues will be generated outside the United States in 2012. We have placed a particularemphasis on expanding our presence in emerging markets.         Aspart of our strategy, we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide. Our reliance on non-U.S. revenues and non-U.S. manufacturing bases exposesus to a number of risks, including:Credit risk or financial condition of local customers and distributors could affect our ability to market our products orcollect receivables; Significant competition could come from local or long-time participants in non-U.S. markets whomay have significantly greater market knowledge and substantially greater resources than we do; Local customers may have a preference for locally-produced products; Failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws regulating trade, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,could result in adverse consequences, including fines, criminal sanctions, or loss of access to markets; Regulatory or political systems or barriers may make it difficult or impossible to enter or remain in new markets. Inaddition, these barriers may impact our existing businesses, including making it more difficult for them to grow; Local political, economic and social conditions, including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions and politicalinstability could adversely impact our operations; Domestic and foreign customs and tariffs may make it difficult or impossible for us to move our products or assets acrossborders in a cost-effective manner; Transportation and shipping expenses add cost to our products; Complications related to shipping, including delays due to weather, labor action, or customs, may impact our profitmargins or lead to lost business; 7 Nationalization of private enterprises could harm our business; Government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions such as anti-dumping duties, as well as the imposition oftrade sanctions by the United States or the European Union against a class of products imported by us from, sold by us and exported to, or the loss of ""normal trade relations"" status with, countriesin which we conduct business could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the United States or Europe or reduce our sales and harm our business;  Environmental and other laws and regulations could increase our costs or limit our ability to run our business;  Our ability to obtain supplies from foreign vendors and ship products internationally may be impaired during times ofcrisis or otherwise; It may be difficult or impossible to protect our intellectual property; Local, regional or worldwide hostilities could impact our operations; and Distance, language and cultural differences may make it more difficult to manage the business and employees, and toeffectively market our products and services.         Healthconditions and other factors affecting social and economic activity in China, South Africa and other emerging markets or affecting the movement of people and products into andfrom these countries to our major markets, including North America and Europe, could have a significant negative effect on our operations.         Giventhe importance of our international sales and sourcing of manufacturing, the occurrence of any risk described above could have a material adverse effect on our financial position,results of operations or cash flows.  Currency conversion risk could have a material impact on our reported results of business operations.          Our operating results are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of theU.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into U.S. dollars. In addition, sales and purchases in currencies otherthan the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in U.S.dollars into other countries, which may have a material adverse effect on sales or require us to lower our prices, and also decrease our reported revenues or margins in respect of sales conducted inforeign currencies to the extent we are unable or determine not to increase local currency prices. Likewise, decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on the cost ofmaterials and products purchased overseas.  A portion of our revenues is generated through long-term fixed-price contracts, which entail risks including cost overruns, inflation, delays and credit andother counterparty risks.          A portion of our revenues and earnings is generated through long-term fixed-price contracts, particularlyin our Thermal Equipment and Services and Flow Technology segments. We recognize revenues from certain of these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method ofaccounting whereby revenues and expenses, and thereby profit, in a given period are determined based on our estimates as to the project status and the costs remaining to complete a particular project.         Estimatesof total revenues and cost at completion are subject to many variables, including the length of time to complete a contract. In addition, contract delays may negatively impactthese estimates and our revenues and earnings results for affected periods.         Tothe extent that we underestimate the remaining cost to complete a project, we may overstate the revenues and profit in a particular period. Further, certain of these contracts providefor penalties or liquidated damages for failure to timely perform our obligations under the contract, or require that we, at our expense, correct and remedy to the satisfaction of the other partycertain defects. Because some of our long-term contracts are at a fixed price, we face the risk that cost overruns or inflation may exceed, erode or eliminate our expected profit margin,or cause us to record a loss on our projects. Additionally, customers of our long-term contracts may suffer financial difficulties that make them unable to pay for a project whencompleted, or they may decide not to pay us, either as a matter of corporate decision-making or in response to changes in local laws and regulations. We cannot assure you that expenses or losses foruncollectible billings relating to our long-term fixed-price contracts will not have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings. 8  Worldwide economic conditions could negatively impact our businesses.          The general worldwide depressed economic conditions that began in 2008 continue to affect many industries, includingindustries in which we or our customers operate. These conditions could negatively impact our businesses by adversely affecting, among other things,our:Revenues; Profits; Margins; Cash flows; Suppliers' and distributors' ability to perform and the availability and costs of materials and subcontracted services;  Customers' orders; Order cancellation activity or delays on existing orders; Customers' ability to access credit; andCustomers' ability to pay amounts due to us.         Whileit is difficult to predict the duration or severity of these conditions, our projections for 2012 assume a generally improving economy. If economic conditions fail to improve, thenegative impact on our businesses could increase or continue for longer than we expect. See MD&A for further discussion of how these conditions have affected our businesses to date and how they mayaffect them in the future.  Our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.          At December 31, 2011, we had $2,001.1 in total indebtedness. On that same date, we had $485.3 of availableborrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities after giving effect to $30.9 of outstanding borrowings on the foreign trade revolving loan facility and $83.8 reserved for outstanding lettersof credit. In addition, we had $408.6 of available issuance capacity under our foreign trade facility after giving effect to $791.4 reserved for outstanding letters of credit. At December 31,2011, our cash and equivalents balance was $551.0. See MD&A and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future,including indebtedness incurred to finance, or which is assumed in connection with, acquisitions. We may renegotiate or refinance our senior credit facilities, senior notes or other debt facilities,or enter into additional agreements that have different or more stringent terms. The level of our indebtedness could:Limit our ability to obtain, or obtain on favorable terms, additional debt financing for working capital, capitalexpenditures or acquisitions; Limit our flexibility in reacting to competitive and other changes in the industry and economic conditions;  Limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock; Coupled with a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows due to economic developments or adverse developments inour business, make it difficult to meet debt service requirements; andExpose us to interest rate fluctuations to the extent existing borrowings are, and any new borrowings may be, at variablerates of interest, which could result in higher interest expense and interest payments in the event of increases in interest rates.         Ourability to make scheduled payments of principal or pay interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operatingperformance, which may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors beyond our control. In addition, we cannot assure that futureborrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, whether in the ordinary course of business or upon anacceleration of such indebtedness, we may pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures,revising implementation of or delaying strategic plans or seeking additional equity capital. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results ofoperations and stock price. In addition, we cannot assure that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements, orthat these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements. 9         Numerousbanks in many countries are syndicate members in our credit facility. Failure of one or more of our larger lenders, or several of our smaller lenders, could significantly reduceavailability of our credit, which could harm our liquidity.  We may not be able to finance future needs or adapt our business plan to react to changes in economic or business conditions because of restrictions placed on us by oursenior credit facilities and any existing or future instruments governing our other indebtedness.          Our senior credit facilities, the indentures governing our senior notes and agreements governing our other indebtednesscontain, or future or revised instruments may contain, a number of restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unlesscertain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied. We also must comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests. Our subsidiaries may also be subject to restrictions on their ability tomake distributions to us. In addition, our senior credit facilities, indentures governing our senior notes and any other agreements contain or may contain additional affirmative and negativecovenants. Existing restrictions are described more fully in the MD&A and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. Each of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate ourbusiness and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities, such as acquisitions.         Ifwe do not comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our senior credit facilities, indentures governing our senior notes and agreements governing our other indebtedness,we could be in default under those agreements, and the debt, together with accrued interest, could then be declared immediately due and payable. If we default under our senior credit facilities, thelenders could cause all our outstanding debt obligations under our senior credit facilities to become due and payable or require us to apply all of our cash to repay the indebtedness we owe. If ourdebt is accelerated, we may not be able to repay or refinance our debt. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Inaddition, any default under our senior credit facilities, indentures governing our senior notes or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debtinstruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. If the indebtedness under our senior credit facilities is accelerated, we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts dueunder our senior credit facilities, senior notes or other debt securities then outstanding. Our ability to comply with these provisions of our senior credit facilities, indentures governing our seniornotes and agreements governing our other indebtedness will be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control. Complying with our covenants may also causeus to take actions that are not favorable to us and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete, including against companies that are not subject tosuch restrictions.  We are subject to laws, regulations and potential liability relating to claims, complaints and proceedings, including those relating to environmental and other matters.          We are subject to various laws, ordinances, regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the UnitedStates and other nations. With respect to acquisitions, divestitures and continuing operations, we may acquire or retain liabilities of which we are not aware, or of a different character or magnitudethan expected. Additionally, changes in laws, ordinances, regulations or other governmental policies may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities.         Weface environmental exposures including, for example, those relating to discharges from and materials handled as part of our operations, the remediation of soil and groundwatercontaminated by petroleum products or hazardous substances or wastes, and the health and safety of our employees. We may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardoussubstances or petroleum products on, under, or in our current or formerly owned or leased property, or from a third-party disposal facility that we may have used, without regard to whether we knew of,or caused, the presence of the contaminants. The presence of, or failure to properly remediate, these substances may have adverse effects, including, for example, substantial investigative or remedialobligations and limitations on the ability to sell or rent affected property or to borrow funds using affected property as collateral. New or existing environmental matters orchanges in environmental laws or policies could lead to material costs for environmental compliance or cleanup. There can be no assurance that these liabilities and costs will not have a materialadverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.         Numerousclaims, complaints and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including those relating to litigation matters (e.g., class actions, derivative lawsuitsand contracts, intellectual property and competitive claims), environmental matters, and risk management matters (e.g., product and general liability, automobile, and workers' compensationclaims), have been filed or are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries. From time to time, we face actions by governmental authorities, both in and outside the United States. Additionally,we may become subject to significant claims of which we are currently unaware or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring a significantly greater 10 liabilitythan we anticipate. Our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable (e.g., because of insurer insolvency) to protect us against potential loss exposures. We have increased ourself-insurance limits over the past several years, which has increased our uninsured exposure.         Wedevote significant time and expense to defense against the various claims, complaints and proceedings brought against us, and we cannot assure you that the expenses or distractionsfrom operating our businesses arising from these defenses will not increase materially.         Wecannot assure you that our accruals and right to indemnity and insurance will be sufficient, that recoveries from insurance or indemnification claims will be available or that any ofour current or future claims or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See ""MD&A  Critical AccountingPolicies and Use of Estimates  Contingent Liabilities.""  Changes in tax laws and regulations or other factors could cause our income tax rate to increase, potentially reducing our net income and adversely affecting our cash flows.          As a global manufacturing company, we are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions around the world. In preparingour financial statements, we calculate our effective income tax rate based on current tax laws and regulations and the estimated taxable income within each of these jurisdictions. Our effective incometax rate, however, may be higher due to numerous factors, including changes in tax laws or regulations. An effective income tax rate significantly higher than our expectations could have an adverseeffect on our business, results of operations, and liquidity.         Officialsin some of the jurisdictions in which we do business have proposed, or announced that they are reviewing, tax changes that could potentially increase taxes, and otherrevenue-raising laws and regulations. Any such changes in taxlaws or regulations could impose new restrictions, costs or prohibitions on existing practices as well as reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows.  Changes in key estimates and assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed long-term return on assets, assumed long-term trends of future cost, andaccounting and legislative changes, as well as actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and other actuarial factors, could affect our results of operations and cash flows.          We have defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, including both qualified and non-qualified plans,which cover a portion of our salaried and hourly employees and retirees including a portion of our employees and retirees in foreign countries. As of December 31, 2011, these plans wereunderfunded by $511.7. The determination of funding requirements and pension expense or income associated with these plans involves significant judgment, particularly with respect to discount rates,long-term returns on assets, long-term trends of future costs and other actuarial assumptions. If our assumptions change significantly due to changes in economic, legislativeand/or demographic experience or circumstances, our pension and other benefit plans' expense, funded status and our cash contributions to such plans could be negatively impacted. In addition, thedifference between our actual investment returns and our long-term return on assets assumptions could result in a change to our pension plans' expense, funded status and our requiredcontributions to the plans. Changes in regulations or law could also significantly impact our obligations. For example, See ""MD&A  Critical Accounting Policies and Use ofEstimates"" for the impact that changes in certain assumptions used in the calculation of our costs and obligations associated with these plans could have on our results of operations and financialposition.  The price and availability of raw materials may adversely affect our results.          We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including inflation in the prices and shortages of raw materials. Inrecent years, we have faced significant volatility in the prices of many of our key raw materials, including petroleum-based products, steel and copper. Increases in the prices of raw materials orshortages or allocations of materials may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as we may not be able to pass cost increases on to ourcustomers, or our sales may be reduced. We are subject to long-term supplier contracts that may increase our exposure to pricing fluctuations. 11  Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could have a negative effect on our operations; our acquisitions could cause financial difficulties.          Our acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges,including:Adverse effects on our reported operating results due to charges to earnings, including impairment charges associated withgoodwill and other intangibles; Diversion of management attention from running our businesses; Integration of technology, operations, personnel and financial and other systems;  Increased expenses; Increased foreign operations, often with unique issues relating to corporate culture, compliance with legal and regulatoryrequirements and other challenges; Assumption of known and unknown liabilities and exposure to litigation; Increased levels of debt or dilution to existing shareholders; andPotential disputes with the sellers of acquired businesses, technology, services or products.         Inaddition, internal controls over financial reporting of acquired companies may not be up to required standards. Issues may exist that could rise to the level of significantdeficiencies or, in some cases, material weaknesses, particularly with respect to foreign companies or non-public U.S. companies.         Ourintegration activities may place substantial demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. Customer dissatisfaction or performanceproblems with an acquired business, technology, service or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.  We may not achieve the expected cost savings and other benefits of our acquisitions.          We strive for and expect to achieve cost savings in connection with our acquisitions, including:(i) manufacturing process and supply chain rationalization; (ii) streamlining redundant administrative overhead and support activities; and (iii) restructuring and repositioningsales and marketing organizations to eliminate redundancies. Cost savings expectations are estimates that are inherently difficult to predict and are necessarily speculative in nature, and we cannotassure you that we will achieve expected, or any, cost savings. In addition, we cannot assure you that unforeseen factors will not offset the estimated cost savings or other benefits from ouracquisitions. As a result, anticipated benefits could be delayed, differ significantly from our estimates and the other information contained in this report, or not be realized.  Our failure to successfully complete acquisitions could negatively affect us.          We may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions, which could materially impact our growth rate, results ofoperations, future cash flows and stock price. Our ability to achieve our goals depends upon, among other things, our ability to identify and successfully acquire companies, businesses and productlines, to effectively integrate them and to achieve cost effectiveness. We may also be unable to raise any additional funds necessary to consummate these acquisitions. In addition, decreases in ourstock price may adversely affect our ability to consummate acquisitions. Competition for acquisitions in our business areas may be significant and result in higher prices for businesses, includingbusinesses that we may target, which may also affect our acquisition rate or benefits achieved from our acquisitions.  We operate in highly competitive industries. Our failure to compete effectively could harm our business.          We operate in a highly competitive environment, competing on the basis of product offerings, technical capabilities,quality, service and pricing. We have a number of competitors, some of which are large, with substantial technological and financial resources, brand recognition and established relationships withglobal service providers. Some of our competitors have low cost structures, support from governments in their home countries, or both. In addition, new competitors may enter the industry. Competitorsmay be able to offer lower prices, additional products or services or a more attractive mix of products or services, or services or other incentives that we cannot or will not match.These competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new or emerging technologies and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, and make more attractive offers topotential customers, employees and strategic partners. 12  Our strategy to outsource various elements of the products we sell subjects us to the business risks of our suppliers, which could have a material adverse impact on ouroperations.          In areas where we depend on third-party suppliers for outsourced products or components, we are subject to the risk ofcustomer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of the products we sell due to supplier failure. In addition, business difficulties experienced by a third-party supplier can lead to theinterruption of our ability to obtain the outsourced product and ultimately our inability to supply products to our customers. Third-party supplier business interruptions can include, but are notlimited to, work stoppages and union negotiations and other labor disputes. Current economic conditions could impact the ability of suppliers to access credit and thus impair their ability to provideus quality product in a timely manner, or at all.  Dispositions or our failure to successfully complete dispositions could negatively affect us.          Our dispositions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, includingdiversion of management attention from running our core businesses, increased expense associated with the dispositions, potential disputes with the customers or suppliers of the disposed businesses,potential disputes with the acquirers of the disposed businesses and a potential dilutive effect on our earnings per share. If dispositions are not completed in a timely manner there may be a negativeeffect on our cash flows and/or our ability to execute our strategy. See ""Business,"" ""MD&A  Results of Discontinued Operations,"" and Note 4 to our consolidated financialstatements for the status of our divestitures.  Increases in the number of shares of our outstanding common stock could adversely affect our common stock price or dilute our earnings per share.          Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock into the public market, or the perception that these salescould occur, could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. As of December 31, 2011, we had the ability to issue up to an additional 5.0 shares as restricted stock, restricted stockunits, or stock options under our 2002 Stock Compensation Plan, as amended in 2006. Additionally, we may issue a significant number of additional shares, in connection with acquisitions or otherwise.We also have a shelf registration statement for 8.3 shares of common stock that may be issued in connection with acquisitions. Additional shares issued would have a dilutive effect on our earnings pershare.  The loss of key personnel and any inability to attract and retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations.          We are dependent on the continued services of our leadership team. The loss of these personnel without adequatereplacement could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience in manylocations in order to operate our business successfully. From time to time, there may be a shortage of skilled labor, which may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retainqualified employees. If we were unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals or our costs to do so were to increase significantly, our operations could be materiallyadversely affected.  If the fair value of any of our reporting units is insufficient to recover the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangibles of the respective reporting unit, amaterial non-cash charge to earnings could result.          At December 31, 2011, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net of $3,030.0. We conduct annual impairmenttesting to determine if we will be able to recover all or a portion of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. In addition, we review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibleassets for impairment more frequently if impairment indicators arise. If the fair value is insufficient to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, we may berequired to record a material non-cash charge to earnings.         Thefair values of our reporting units generally are based on discounted cash flow projections that are believed to be reasonable under current and forecasted circumstances, the resultsof which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of the reported net assets of our reporting units. Other considerations are also incorporated, including comparable industry pricemultiples. Many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets that they serve. Accordingly, we consider estimates and judgments that affect the future cash flowprojections, including principal methods of competition such as volume, price, service, product performance and technical innovations and estimates associated with cost improvement initiatives,capacity utilization, and assumptions for inflation and foreign currency changes. We monitor impairment indicators across all of our businesses. Significant changes in market conditions and estimatesor judgments used to determine expected future cash flows that indicate a reduction in carrying value may give, and have given, rise to impairments in the period that the change becomes known. 13  We are subject to work stoppages, union negotiations, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force, which may adversely impact our operations and causeus to incur incremental costs.          At December 31, 2011, we had approximately 18,000 employees. Eleven domestic collective bargaining agreementscover approximately 1,100 employees. We also have various collective labor arrangements covering certain non-U.S. employee groups. We are subject to potential union campaigns, workstoppages, union negotiations and other potential labor disputes. Further, we may be subject to work stoppages, which are beyond our control, at our suppliers or customers.  Our technology is important to our success, and failure to develop new products may result in a significant competitive disadvantage.          We believe that the development and protection of our intellectual property rights is critical to the success of ourbusiness. In order to maintain our market positions and margins, we need to continually develop and introduce high quality, technologically advanced and cost effective products on a timely basis, inmany cases in multiple jurisdictions around the world. The failure to do so could result in a significant competitive disadvantage.         Additionally,despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. The steps wehave taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. Expenses inconnection with defending our rights may be material.  If we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted.          We are increasingly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process,transmit and store electronic information. In particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and between ourpersonnel and suppliers and customers. Security breaches of this infrastructure can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If we are unable toprevent or adequately respond to such breaches, our operations could be disrupted or we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information.  Cost reduction actions may affect our business.          Cost reduction actions often result in charges against earnings. These charges can vary significantly from period toperiod and, as a result, we may experience fluctuations in our reported net income andearnings per share due to the timing of restructuring actions, which in turn can have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Our current and planned products may contain defects or errors that are detected only after delivery to customers. If that occurs, our reputation may be harmed and we mayface additional costs.          We cannot assure you that our product development, manufacturing and integration testing will be adequate to detect alldefects, errors, failures and quality issues that could impact customer satisfaction or result in claims against us with regard to our products. As a result, we may have, and from time to time havehad, to replace certain components and/or provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects in products that are shipped. The occurrence of any defects, errors, failures or quality issuescould result in cancellation of orders, product returns, diversion of our resources, legal actions by our customers or our customers' end users and other losses to us or to our customers or end users,and could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and loss of sales, which would harm our business and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.  We could be affected by laws or regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change.          Changes in laws or regulations enacted in response to concerns over potential climate change could increase our costsor impact markets for our products. However, we cannot currently estimate the effects, if any, of changes in climate change-related laws or regulations on our business. 14  Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company, and accordingly, we may not consummate a transaction that ourshareholders consider favorable.          Provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws may inhibit changes in control of our companynot approved by our Board. These provisions include, for example: a staggered board of directors; a prohibition on shareholder action by written consent; a requirement that special shareholdermeetings be called only by our Chairman, President or Board; advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations; limitations on shareholders' ability to amend, alter or repeal theBy-laws; enhanced voting requirements for certain business combinations involving substantial shareholders; the authority of our Board to issue, without shareholder approval, preferredstock with terms determined in its discretion; and limitations on shareholders' ability to remove directors. In addition, we are afforded the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware GeneralCorporation Law, which could have similar effects. In general, Section 203 prohibits us from engaging in a ""businesscombination"" with an ""interested shareholder"" (each as defined in Section 203) for at least three years after the time the person became an interested shareholder unless certain conditions aremet. These protective provisions could result in our not consummating a transaction that our shareholders consider favorable or discourage entities from attempting to acquire us, potentially at asignificant premium to our then-existing stock price. 15"
15,SPXC,SPX CORP,2011-02-22,"ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
             (Allamounts are in millions, except per share data)         Youshould consider the risks described below and elsewhere in our documents filed with the SEC before investing in any of our securities. We may amend, supplement or add to the riskfactors described below from time to time in future reports filed with the SEC.  Many of the industries in which we operate are cyclical or are subject to industry events, and our results have been and could be affected as a result.          Many of the business areas in which we operate are subject to general economic cycles or industry events. Certain ofour businesses are subject to specific industry cycles or events, including, but not limited to: Customer demand for electricity transformers, which impacts our Industrial Products and Services segment;  The oil and gas, chemical and petrochemical markets, which influence our Flow Technology segment;  The electric power and infrastructure markets and events, which influence our Thermal Equipment and Services andIndustrial Products and Services segments; and   The correlation between demand for cooling systems and towers within our Thermal Equipment and Services segment andcontract timing on large construction projects, which may cause significant fluctuations in revenues and profits from period to period.         Cyclicalchanges and specific market events could also affect sales of products in our other businesses. The downturns in the business cycles of our different operations may occur at thesame time, which could exacerbate any adverse effects on our business. See ""MD&A  Segment Results of Operations."" In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal fluctuations.Historically, our businesses generally tend to be stronger in the second half of the year.  Difficulties presented by international economic, political, legal, accounting and business factors could negatively affect our interests and business effort.          We are an increasingly global company, with a significant portion of our sales taking place outside the United States.In 2010, approximately 55% of our revenues were generated outside the United States and we expect that approximately 50% of our revenues will be generated outside the United States in 2011. We haveplaced a particular emphasis on expanding our presence in developing markets.         Aspart of our strategy, we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide, many of which are located outside the United States.         Ourreliance on non-U.S. revenues and non-U.S. manufacturing bases exposes us to a number of risks, including: Significant competition from local or long-time participants in non-U.S. markets who may havesignificantly greater market knowledge and substantially greater resources than we do;   Local customers may have a preference for locally-produced products. For example, we continue to face significantcompetition from local suppliers in China;   Failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S.laws regulating trade, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,could result in adverse consequences, including fines, criminal sanctions, or loss of access to markets;   Regulatory or political systems or barriers may make it difficult or impossible to enter or remain in new markets. Inaddition, these barriers may impact our existing businesses, including making it more difficult for them to grow;   Domestic and foreign customs and tariffs may make it difficult or impossible for us to move our products or profits acrossborders in a cost-effective manner;   Transportation and shipping expenses add cost to our products;   Complications related to shipping, including delays due to weather, labor action, or customs, may impact our profitmargins or lead to lost business;   Credit risk or financial condition of local customers and distributors could affect our ability to market our products orcollect receivables; 8 Nationalization of private enterprises could harm our business;   Government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions such as anti-dumping duties, as well as the imposition oftrade sanctions by the United States or the European Union against a class of products imported by us from, sold by us and exported to, or the loss of ""normal trade relations"" status with, countriesin which we conduct business could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the United States or Europe or reduce our sales and harm our business;   Environmental and other laws and regulations could increase our costs or limit our ability to run our business;  Our ability to obtain supplies from foreign vendors and ship products internationally may be impaired during times ofcrisis or otherwise;   It may be difficult or impossible to protect our intellectual property;   Local, regional or worldwide hostilities could impact our operations;   Distance, language and cultural differences may make it more difficult to manage the business and employees, and toeffectively market our products and services;   Potential imposition of restrictions on investments; and   Local political, economic and social conditions, including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions and politicalinstability could adversely impact our operations.         Asan increasing percentage of our products is manufactured in China, South Africa and other developing countries, health conditions and other factors affecting social and economicactivity in these countries or affecting the movement of people and products into and from these countries to our major markets, including North America and Europe, could have a significant negativeeffect on our operations.         Giventhe importance of our international sales and sourcing of manufacturing, the occurrence of any risk described above could have a material adverse effect on our financial position,results of operations or cash flows.  Currency conversion risk could have a material impact on our reported results of business operations.          Our sales are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollarcould result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into U.S. dollars. In addition, sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S.dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars intoother countries, which may have a material adverse effect on sales or require us to lower our prices, and also decrease our reported revenues or margins in respect of sales conducted in foreigncurrencies to the extent we are unable or determine not to increase local currency prices. Likewise, decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materialsand products purchased overseas.  A portion of our revenues is generated through long-term fixed-price contracts, which entail risks including cost overruns, inflation, delays and credit andother counterparty risks.          A portion of our revenues and earnings is generated through long-term fixed-price contracts, particularlyin our Thermal Equipment and Services and Flow Technology segments. We recognize revenues from certain of these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method ofaccounting whereby revenues and expenses, and thereby profit, in a given period are determined based on our estimates as to the project status and the costs remaining to complete a particular project.         Estimatesof total revenues and cost at completion are subject to many variables, including the length of time to complete a contract. In addition, contract delays may negatively impactthese estimates and our revenues and earnings results for affected periods.         Tothe extent that we underestimate the remaining cost to complete a project, we may overstate the revenues and profit in a particular period. Further, certain of these contracts providefor penalties or liquidated damages for failure to timely perform our obligations under the contract, or require that we, at our expense, correct and remedy to the satisfaction of the other partycertain defects. Because some of our long-term contracts are at a fixed price, we face the risk that cost overruns or inflation may exceed, erode or eliminate our expected profit margin,or cause us to record a loss on our projects. Additionally, customers of our long-term contracts may suffer financial difficulties that make them unable to pay for a project whencompleted, or they may decide not to pay us, either as a matter of corporate decision-making or in response to changes in local laws and regulations. 9 Wecannot assure you that expenses or losses for uncollectible billings relating to our long-term fixed-price contracts will not have a material adverse effect on our revenues andearnings.  Worldwide economic conditions could negatively impact our businesses.          The general worldwide depressed economic conditions that began in 2008 continue to affect many industries, includingindustries in which we or our customers operate. These conditions could negatively impact our businesses by adversely affecting, among other things, our: Revenues;   Profits;   Margins;   Cash flows;   Suppliers' and distributors' ability to perform and the availability and costs of materials and subcontracted services;  Customers' orders;   Order cancellation activity or delays on existing orders;   Customers' ability to access credit; and   Customers' ability to pay amounts due to us.         Whileit is difficult to predict the duration or severity of these conditions, our projections for 2011 assume a generally improving economy. If economic conditions fail to improve, thenegative impact on our businesses could increase or continue for longer than we expect. See MD&A for further discussion of how these conditions have affected our businesses to date and how they mayaffect them in the future.  Our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.          At December 31, 2010, we had $1,197.6 in total indebtedness. On that same date, we had $503.6 of availableborrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities after giving effect to $96.4 reserved for outstanding letters of credit. In addition, we had $179.8 of available issuance capacity under ourforeign trade facility after giving effect to $770.2 reserved for outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2010, our cash and equivalents balance was $455.4. See MD&A and Note 12to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance, or which is assumed in connection with,acquisitions. We may in the future renegotiate or refinance our senior credit facilities, senior notes or other debt facilities, or enter into additional agreements that have different or morestringent terms. The level of our indebtedness could: Limit our ability to obtain, or obtain on favorable terms, additional debt financing for working capital, capitalexpenditures or acquisitions;   Limit our flexibility in reacting to competitive and other changes in the industry and economic conditions;  Limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock;   Coupled with a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows due to economic developments or adverse developments inour business, make it difficult to meet debt service requirements; and   Expose us to interest rate fluctuations to the extent existing borrowings are, and any new borrowings may be, at variablerates of interest, which could result in higher interest expense and interest payments in the event of increases in interest rates.         Ourability to make scheduled payments of principal or pay interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operatingperformance, which may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors beyond our control. In addition, we cannot assure that futureborrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, whether in the ordinary course of business or upon anacceleration of such indebtedness, we may pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures,revising implementation of or delaying strategic plans or seeking additional equity capital. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results ofoperations and stock price. In 10 addition,we cannot assure that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements, or that these actions would bepermitted under the terms of our various debt agreements.         Numerousbanks in many countries are syndicate members in our credit facility. Failure of one or more of our larger lenders, or several of our smaller lenders, could reduce availabilityof our credit, which could harm our liquidity.  We may not be able to finance future needs or adapt our business plan to react to changes in economic or business conditions because of restrictions placed on us by oursenior credit facilities and any existing or future instruments governing our other indebtedness.          Our senior credit facilities, the indentures governing our senior notes and agreements governing our other indebtednesscontain, or future or revised instruments may contain, a number of restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unlesscertain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied. We also must comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests. Our subsidiaries may also be subject to restrictions on their ability tomake distributions to us. In addition, our senior credit facilities, indentures governing our senior notes and any other agreements contain or may contain additional affirmative and negativecovenants. Existing restrictions are described more fully in the MD&A and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. Each of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate ourbusiness and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities, such as acquisitions.         Ifwe do not comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our senior credit facilities, indentures governing our senior notes and agreements governing our other indebtedness,we could be in default under those agreements, and the debt, together with accrued interest, could then be declared immediately due and payable. If we default under our senior credit facilities, thelenders could cause all our outstanding debt obligations under our senior credit facilities to become due and payable or require us to apply all of our cash to repay the indebtedness we owe. If ourdebt is accelerated, we may not be able to repay or refinance our debt. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Inaddition, any default under our senior credit facilities, indentures governing our senior notes or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debtinstruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. If the indebtedness under our senior credit facilities is accelerated, we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts dueunder our senior credit facilities, senior notes or other debt securities then outstanding. Our ability to comply with these provisions of our senior credit facilities, indentures governing our seniornotes and agreements governing our other indebtedness will be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control. Complying with our covenants may also causeus to take actions that are not favorable to us and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete, including against companies that are not subject tosuch restrictions.  We are subject to laws, regulations and potential liability relating to claims, complaints and proceedings, including those relating to environmental and other matters.          We are subject to various laws, ordinances, regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the UnitedStates and other nations. With respect to acquisitions, divestitures and continuing operations, we may acquire or retain liabilities of which we are not aware, or of a different character or magnitudethan expected. Additionally, changes in laws, ordinances, regulations or other governmental policies may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities.         Weface environmental exposures including, for example, those relating to discharges from and materials handled as part of our operations, the remediation of soil and groundwatercontaminated by petroleum products or hazardous substances or wastes, and the health and safety of our employees. We may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardoussubstances or petroleum products on, under, or in our current or formerly owned or leased property, or from a third-party disposal facility that we may have used, without regard to whether we knew of,or caused, the presence of the contaminants. The presence of, or failure to properly remediate, these substances may have adverse effects, including, for example, substantial investigative or remedialobligations and limitations on the ability to sell or rent affected property or to borrow funds using affected property as collateral. New or existing environmental matters or changes in environmentallaws or policies could lead to material costs for environmental compliance or cleanup. There can be no assurance that these liabilities and costs will not have a material adverse effect on ourfinancial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.         Numerousclaims, complaints and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including those relating to litigation matters (e.g., class actions, derivative lawsuitsand contracts, intellectual property and competitive claims), environmental matters, and risk management matters (e.g., product and general liability, automobile, and workers' compensationclaims), have been filed or are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries. From time to time, we face 11 actionsby governmental authorities, both in and outside the United States. Additionally, we may become subject to significant claims, of which we are currently unaware or the claims of which we areaware may result in our incurring a significantly greater liability than we anticipate. Our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures. We haveincreased our self-insurance limits over the past several years, which has increased our uninsured exposure.         Wedevote significant time and expense to defense against the various claims, complaints and proceedings brought against us, and we cannot assure you that the expenses or distractionsfrom operating our businesses arising from these defenses will not increase materially.         Wecannot assure you that our accruals and right to indemnity and insurance will be sufficient, that recoveries from insurance or indemnification claims will be available or that any ofour current or future claims or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See ""MD&A  Critical AccountingPolicies and Use of Estimates  Contingent Liabilities.""  Changes in tax laws and regulations or other factors could cause our income tax rate to increase, potentially reducing our net income and adversely affecting our cash flows.          As a global manufacturing company, we are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions around the world. In preparingour financial statements, we calculate our effective income tax rate based on current tax laws and regulations and the estimated taxable income within each of these jurisdictions. Our effective incometax rate, however, may be higher due to numerous factors, including changes in tax laws or regulations. An effective income tax rate significantly higher than our expectations could have an adverseeffect on our business, results of operations, and liquidity.         Officialsin some of the jurisdictions in which we do business have proposed, or announced that they are reviewing, tax increases and other revenue-raising laws and regulations. Anyresulting changes in tax laws or regulations could impose new restrictions, costs or prohibitions on our current practices and reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows.  Changes in key estimates and assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed long-term return on assets, assumed long-term trends of future cost, andaccounting and legislative changes, as well as actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and other actuarial factors, could affect our results of operations and cash flows.          We have defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, including both qualified and non-qualified plans,that cover a portion of our salaried and hourly employees and retirees including a portion of our employees and retirees in foreign countries. As of December 31, 2010, these plans wereunderfunded by $463.5. The determination of funding requirements and pension expense or income associated with these plans involves significant judgment, particularly with respect to discount rates,long-term returns on assets, long-term trends of future costs and other actuarial assumptions. If our assumptions change significantly due to changes in economic, legislativeand/or demographic experience or circumstances, our pension and other benefit plans' expense, funded status and our cash contributions to such plans could be negatively impacted. In addition, thedifference between our actual investment returns and our long-term return on assets assumptions could result in a change to our pension plans' expense, funded status and our requiredcontributions to the plans. Changes in regulations or law could also significantly impact our obligations. For example, See ""MD&A  Critical Accounting Policies and Use ofEstimates"" for the impact that changes in certain assumptions used in the calculation of our costs and obligations associated with these plans could have on our results of operations and financialposition.  The price and availability of raw materials may adversely affect our results.          We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including inflation in the prices and shortages of raw materials. Inrecent years, we have faced significant volatility in the prices of many of our key raw materials, including petroleum-based products, steel and copper. Increases in the prices of raw materials orshortages or allocations of materials may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as we may not be able to pass cost increases on to ourcustomers, or our sales may be reduced. We are subject to long-term supplier contracts that may increase our exposure to pricing fluctuations. 12  Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could have a negative effect on our operations; our acquisitions could cause financial difficulties.          Our acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges,including: Adverse effects on our reported operating results due to charges to earnings, including impairment charges associated withgoodwill and other intangibles;   Diversion of management attention from running our businesses;   Integration of technology, operations, personnel and financial and other systems;   Increased expenses;   Increased foreign operations, often with unique issues relating to corporate culture, compliance with legal and regulatoryrequirements and other challenges;   Assumption of known and unknown liabilities and exposure to litigation;   Increased levels of debt or dilution to existing shareholders; and   Potential disputes with the sellers of acquired businesses, technology, services or products.         Inaddition, internal controls over financial reporting of acquired companies may not be up to required standards. Issues may exist that could rise to the level of significantdeficiencies or, in some cases, material weaknesses, particularly with respect to foreign companies or non-public U.S. companies.         Ourintegration activities may place substantial demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. Customer dissatisfaction or performanceproblems with an acquired business, technology, service or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.  We may not achieve the expected cost savings and other benefits of our acquisitions.          We strive for and expect to achieve cost savings in connection with our acquisitions, including:(i) manufacturing process and supply chain rationalization; (ii) streamlining redundant administrative overhead and support activities; and (iii) restructuring and repositioningsales and marketing organizations to eliminate redundancies. Cost savings expectations are estimates that are inherently difficult to predict and are necessarily speculative in nature, and we cannotassure you that we will achieve expected, or any, cost savings. In addition, we cannot assure you that unforeseen factors will not offset the estimated cost savings or other benefits from ouracquisitions. As a result, anticipated benefits could be delayed, differ significantly from our estimates and the other information contained in this report, or not be realized.  Our failure to successfully complete acquisitions could negatively affect us.          We may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions, which could materially impact our growth rate, results ofoperations, future cash flows and stock price. Our ability to achieve our goals depends upon, among other things, our ability to identify and successfully acquire companies, businesses and productlines, to effectively integrate them and to achieve cost effectiveness. We may also be unable to raise any additional funds necessary to consummate these acquisitions. In addition, decreases in ourstock price may adversely affect our ability to consummate acquisitions. Competition for acquisitions in our business areas may be significant and result in higher prices for businesses, includingbusinesses that we may target, which may also affect our acquisition rate or benefits achieved from our acquisitions.  We operate in highly competitive industries. Our failure to compete effectively could harm our business.          We operate in a highly competitive environment, competing on the basis of product offerings, technical capabilities,quality, service and pricing. We have a number of competitors, some of which are large, with substantial technological and financial resources, brand recognition and established relationships withglobal service providers. Some of our competitors have low cost structures, support from governments in their home countries, or both. In addition, new competitors may enter the industry. Competitorsmay be able to offer lower prices, additional products or services or a more attractive mix of products or services, or services or other incentives that we cannot or will not match. These competitorsmay be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new or emerging technologies and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, and make more attractive offers to potentialcustomers, employees and strategic partners. 13  Our strategy to outsource various elements of the products we sell subjects us to the business risks of our suppliers, which could have a material adverse impact on ouroperations.          In areas where we depend on third-party suppliers for outsourced products or components, we are subject to the risk ofcustomer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of the products we sell due to supplier failure. In addition, business difficulties experienced by a third-party supplier can lead to theinterruption of our ability to obtain the outsourced product and ultimately our inability to supply products to our customers. Third-party supplier business interruptions can include, but are notlimited to, work stoppages and union negotiations and other labor disputes. Current economic conditions could impact the ability of suppliers to access credit and, thus, impair their ability toprovide us quality product in a timely manner, or at all.  Dispositions or our failure to successfully complete dispositions could negatively affect us.          Our dispositions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, includingdiversion of management attention from running our core businesses, increased expense associated with the dispositions, potential disputes with the customers or suppliers of the disposed businesses,potential disputes with the acquirers of the disposed businesses and a potential dilutive effect on our earnings per share. If dispositions are not completed in a timely manner there may be a negativeeffect on our cash flows and/or our ability to execute our strategy. See ""Business"", ""MD&A  Results of Discontinued Operations"", and Note 4 to our consolidated financialstatements for the status of our divestitures.  Increases in the number of shares of our outstanding common stock could adversely affect our common stock price or dilute our earnings per share.          Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock into the public market, or the perception that these salescould occur, could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. As of December 31, 2010, we had the ability to issue up to an additional 5.0 shares as restricted stock, restricted stockunits, or stock options under our 2002 Stock Compensation Plan, as amended in 2006. Additionally, we may issue a significant number of additional shares, in connection with acquisitions or otherwise.We also have a shelf registration statement for 8.3 shares of common stock that may be issued in connection with acquisitions. Additional shares issued would have a dilutive effect on our earnings pershare.  The loss of key personnel and any inability to attract and retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations.          We are dependent on the continued services of our leadership team. The loss of these personnel without adequatereplacement could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience in manylocations in order to operate our business successfully. From time to time, there may be a shortage of skilled labor, which may makeit more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain qualified employees. If we were unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals or our costs to do so were toincrease significantly, our operations could be materially adversely affected.  If the fair value of any of our reporting units is insufficient to recover the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangibles of the respective reporting unit, amaterial non-cash charge to earnings could result.          At December 31, 2010, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net of $2,354.1. We conduct annual impairmenttesting to determine if we will be able to recover all or a portion of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. In addition, we review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibleassets for impairment more frequently if impairment indicators arise. If the fair value is insufficient to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, we may berequired to record a material non-cash charge to earnings.         Thefair values of our reporting units generally are based on discounted cash flow projections that are believed to be reasonable under current and forecasted circumstances, the resultsof which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of the reported net assets of our reporting units. Other considerations are also incorporated, including comparable industry pricemultiples. Many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets that they serve. Accordingly, we consider estimates and judgments that affect the future cash flowprojections, including principal methods of competition such as volume, price, service, product performance and technical innovations and estimates associated with cost improvement initiatives,capacity utilization, and assumptions for inflation and foreign currency changes. We monitor impairment indicators across all of our businesses. Significant changes in market conditions and estimatesor judgments used to determine expected future cash flows that indicate a reduction in carrying value may give, and have given, rise to impairments in the period that the change becomes known. 14         Inconnection with our annual goodwill impairment testing in 2010, we determined that the estimated fair value of our SPX Heat Transfer and Anhydro reporting units, businesses that wereacquired in the last 18 months, were comparable to the carrying value of their respective net assets. Goodwill attributable to these reporting units totaled $64.1 at December 31, 2010.  We are subject to work stoppages, union negotiations, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force, which may adversely impact our operations and causeus to incur incremental costs.          At December 31, 2010, we had approximately 15,500 employees. Nine domestic collective bargaining agreementscover approximately 1,000 employees. We also have various collective labor arrangementscovering certain non-U.S. employee groups. We are subject to potential union campaigns, work stoppages, union negotiations and other potential labor disputes. Further, we may be subject towork stoppages, which are beyond our control, at our suppliers or customers.  We could be affected by laws or regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change.          Changes in laws or regulations enacted in response to concerns over potential climate change could increase our costsor impact markets for our products. However, we cannot currently estimate the effects, if any, of changes in climate change-related laws or regulations on our business.  Our technology is important to our success, and failure to develop new products may result in a significant competitive disadvantage.          We believe that the development and protection of our intellectual property rights is critical to the success of ourbusiness. In order to maintain our market positions and margins, we need to continually develop and introduce high quality, technologically advanced and cost effective products on a timely basis, inmany cases in multiple jurisdictions around the world. The failure to do so could result in a significant competitive disadvantage.         Additionally,despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. The steps wehave taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. Expenses inconnection with defending our rights may be material.  If we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted.          We are increasingly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process,transmit and store electronic information. In particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and between ourpersonnel and suppliers and customers. Security breaches of this infrastructure can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If we are unable toprevent such breaches, our operations could be disrupted or we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information.  Cost reduction actions may affect our business.          Cost reduction actions often result in charges against earnings. These charges can vary significantly from period toperiod and, as a result, we may experience fluctuations in our reported net income and earnings per share due to the timing of restructuring actions, which in turn can have a material adverse effecton our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Our current and planned products may contain defects or errors that are detected only after delivery to customers. If that occurs, our reputation may be harmed and we mayface additional costs.          We cannot assure you that our product development, manufacturing and integration testing will be adequate to detect alldefects, errors, failures and quality issues that could impact customer satisfaction or result in claims against us with regard to our products. As a result, we may have, and from time to time havehad, to replace certain components and/or provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects in products that are shipped. The occurrence of any defects, errors, failures or quality issuescould result in cancellation of orders, product returns, diversion of our resources, legal actions by our customers or our customers' end users and other losses to us or to our customers or end users,and could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and loss of sales, which would harm our business and adversely affect our revenues and profitability. 15  Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company, and accordingly, we may not consummate a transaction that ourshareholders consider favorable.          Provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws may inhibit changes in control of our companynot approved by our Board. These provisions include, for example: a staggered board of directors; a prohibition on shareholder action by written consent; a requirement that special shareholdermeetings be called only by our Chairman, President or Board; advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations; limitations on shareholders' ability to amend, alter or repeal theBy-laws; enhanced voting requirements for certain business combinations involving substantial shareholders; the authority of our Board to issue, without shareholder approval, preferredstock with terms determined in its discretion; and limitations on shareholders ability to remove directors. In addition, we are afforded the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware GeneralCorporation Law, which could have similar effects. In general, Section 203 prohibits us from engaging in a ""business combination"" with an ""interested shareholder"" (each as defined inSection 203) for at least three years after the time the person became an interested shareholder unless certain conditions are met. These protective provisions could result in our notconsummating a transaction that our shareholders consider favorable or discourage entities from attempting to acquire us, potentially at a significant premium to our then-existing stockprice. 16"
2,SPXC,SPX CORP,2010-02-26,"ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
             (Allamounts are in millions, except per share data)         Youshould consider the risks described below and elsewhere in our documents filed with the SEC before investing in any of our securities. We may amend, supplement or add to the riskfactors described below from time to time in future reports filed with the SEC.  Worldwide economic conditions could negatively impact our businesses.          The general worldwide deterioration of economic conditions and tightening of credit markets which began in 2008continue to affect many industries, including industries in which we or our customers operate. These conditions could negatively impact our businesses by adversely affecting, among other things,our: Revenues;   Profits;   Margins;   Cash flows;   Suppliers' and distributors' ability to perform and the availability and costs of materials and subcontracted services;  Customers' orders;   Order cancellation activity or delays on existing orders;   Customers' ability to access credit; and   Customers' ability to pay amounts due to us.         Wecannot predict the duration or severity of these conditions, but, if they worsen or continue for an extended time, the negative impact on our businesses could increase. See MD&A forfurther discussion of how these conditions have affected our businesses to date and how they may affect it in the future.  Many of the industries in which we operate are cyclical or are subject to industry events, and our results have been and could be affected as a result.          Many of the business areas in which we operate are subject to general economic cycles or industry events. Certain ofour businesses are subject to specific industry cycles or events, including, but not limited to: The oil and gas, chemical and petrochemical markets, which influence our Flow Technology segment;  The electric power and infrastructure markets and events, such as blackouts and brownouts, which influence our ThermalEquipment and Services and Industrial Products and Services segments; and   The correlation between demand for cooling systems and towers within our Thermal Equipment and Services segment andcontract timing on large construction contracts, which could cause significant fluctuations in revenues and profits from period to period.         Cyclicalchanges and specific market events could also affect sales of products in our other businesses. The downturns in the business cycles of our different operations may occur at thesame time, which could exacerbate any adverse effects on our business. See ""MD&A  Segment Results of Operations."" In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal fluctuations.Historically, our businesses generally tend to be stronger in the second half of the year.  Difficulties presented by international economic, political, legal, accounting and business factors could negatively affect our interests and business effort.          We are an increasingly global company, with a significant portion of our sales taking place outside the United States.In 2009, approximately 53% of our revenues were generated outside the United States, and we expect that over 50% of our revenues will be generated outside the United States in 2010. We have placed aparticular emphasis on expanding our presence in developing markets.         Aspart of our strategy, we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide, many of which are located outside the United States. 7         Ourreliance on non-U.S. revenues and non-U.S. manufacturing bases exposes us to a number of risks, including: Possible significant competition from local or long-time participants in non-U.S. markets who mayhave significantly greater market knowledge and substantially greater resources than we do;   Local customers may have a preference for locally-produced products. For example, we continue to face significantcompetition from local suppliers in China;   Failure to comply with U.S. or other laws regulating trade, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, could resultin adverse consequences, including fines, criminal sanctions, or loss of access to markets;   Regulatory or political systems or barriers may make it difficult or impossible to enter and remain in new markets. Inaddition, these barriers may impact our existing businesses, including making it more difficult for them to grow;   Domestic and foreign customs and tariffs may make it difficult or impossible for us to move our products or profits acrossborders in a cost-effective manner;   Transportation and shipping expenses add cost to our products. Complications related to shipping, including delays due toweather, labor action, or customs, may impact our profit margins or lead to lost business;   Credit risk or financial condition of local customers and distributors;   Nationalization of private enterprises;   Government embargos or foreign trade restrictions such as anti-dumping duties. Also, the imposition of tradesanctions by the United States or the European Union against a class of products imported by us from, sold by us and exported to, or the loss of ""normal trade relations"" status with, countries inwhich we conduct business could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the United States or Europe or reduce our sales and harm our business;   Environmental and other laws and regulations;   Our ability to obtain supplies from foreign vendors and ship products internationally may be impaired during times ofcrisis or otherwise;   Difficulties in protecting intellectual property;   Local, regional or worldwide hostilities;   Distance, language and cultural differences may make it more difficult to manage the business and employees, and toeffectively market our products and services;   Potential imposition of restrictions on investments; and   Local political, economic and social conditions, including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions and politicalinstability.         Asan increasing percentage of our products is manufactured in China, South Africa and other developing countries, health conditions and other factors affecting social and economicactivity in these countries or affecting the movement ofpeople and products into and from these countries to our major markets, including North America and Europe, could have a significant negative effect on our operations.         Giventhe importance of our international sales and sourcing of manufacturing, the occurrence of any risk described above could have a material adverse effect on our financial position,results of operations or cash flows.  Currency conversion risk could have a material impact on our reported results of business operations.          Our sales are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollarcould result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into U.S. dollars. In addition, sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S.dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars intoother countries, which may have a material adverse effect on sales or require us to lower our prices, and also decrease our reported revenues or margins in respect of sales conducted in foreigncurrencies to the extent we are unable or determine not to increase local currency prices. Likewise, decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materialsand products purchased overseas. 8  A portion of our revenues is generated through long-term fixed-price contracts, which entail risks including cost overruns, inflation, delays and credit andother counterparty risks.          A portion of our revenues and earnings is generated through long-term fixed-price contracts, particularlyin our Thermal Equipment and Services segment. We recognize revenues from certain of these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting whereby revenuesand expenses, and thereby profit, in a given period are determined based on our estimates as to the project status and the costs remaining to complete a particular project.         Estimatesof total revenues and cost at completion are subject to many variables, including the length of time to complete a contract. In addition, contract delays may negatively impactthese estimates and our revenues and earnings results for affected periods.         Tothe extent that we underestimate the remaining cost to complete a project, we may overstate the revenues and profit in a particular period. Further, certain of these contracts providefor penalties or liquidated damages for failure to timely perform our obligations under the contract, or require that we, at our expense, correct and remedy to the satisfaction of the other partycertain defects. Because some of our long-term contracts are at a fixed price, we face therisk that cost overruns or inflation may exceed, erode or eliminate our expected profit margin, or cause us to record a loss on our projects. Additionally, customers of our long-termcontracts may suffer financial difficulties that make them unable to pay for a project when completed or they may decide not to pay us, either as a matter of corporate decision-making or in responseto changes in local laws and regulations. We cannot assure you that expenses or losses for uncollectible billings relating to our long-term fixed-price contracts will not have a materialadverse effect on our revenues and earnings.  Our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.          At December 31, 2009, we had $1,279.0 in total indebtedness. On that same date, we had $411.0 of availableborrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities after giving effect to borrowings under our domestic revolving loan facility of $61.5 and to $127.5 reserved for outstanding letters of credit.In addition, we had $216.3 of available issuance capacity under our foreign trade facility after giving effect to $733.7 reserved for outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2009, ourcash and equivalents balance was $522.9. See MD&A and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, includingindebtedness incurred to finance, or which is assumed in connection with, acquisitions. We may in the future renegotiate or refinance our senior credit facilities, senior notes or other debtfacilities, or enter into additional agreements that have different or more stringent terms. The level of our indebtedness could: Limit our ability to obtain, or obtain on favorable terms, additional debt financing for working capital, capitalexpenditures or acquisitions;   Limit our flexibility in reacting to competitive and other changes in the industry and economic conditions;  Limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock;   Coupled with a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows due to economic developments or adverse developments inour business, make it difficult to meet debt service requirements; and   Expose us to interest rate fluctuations to the extent existing borrowings are, and any new borrowings may be, at variablerates of interest, which could result in higher interest expense and interest payments in the event of increases in interest rates.         Ourability to make scheduled payments of principal or pay interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operatingperformance, which may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors beyond our control. In addition, we cannot assure that futureborrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, whether in the ordinary course of business or upon anacceleration of such indebtedness, we may pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures,revising implementation of or delaying strategic plans or seeking additional equity capital. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results ofoperations and stock price. In addition, we cannot assure that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements, orthat these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements.         Numerousbanks in many countries are syndicate members in our credit facility. Failure of one or more of our larger lenders, or several of our smaller lenders, could reduce availabilityof our credit, which could harm our liquidity. 9  We may not be able to finance future needs or adapt our business plan to react to changes in economic or business conditions because of restrictions placed on us by oursenior credit facilities and any existing or future instruments governing our other indebtedness.          Our senior credit facilities, the indentures governing our senior notes and agreements governing our other indebtednesscontain, or may contain, a number of restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unless certain financial tests or othercriteria are satisfied. We also must comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests. Our subsidiaries may also be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us. Inaddition, our senior credit facilities, indentures governing our senior notes and any other agreements contain or may contain additional affirmative and negative covenants. Existing restrictions aredescribed more fully in the MD&A. Each of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities, such asacquisitions.         Ifwe do not comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our senior credit facilities, indentures governing our senior notes and agreements governing our other indebtedness,we could be in default under those agreements, and the debt, together with accrued interest, could then be declared immediately due and payable. If we default under our senior credit facilities, thelenders could cause all our outstanding debt obligations under our senior credit facilities to become due and payable or require us to apply all of our cash to repay the indebtedness we owe. If ourdebt is accelerated, we may not be able to repay or refinance our debt. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Inaddition, any default under our senior credit facilities, indentures governing our senior notes or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debtinstruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. If the indebtedness under our senior credit facilities is accelerated, we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts dueunder our senior credit facilities, senior notes or other debt securities then outstanding. Our ability to comply with these provisions of our senior credit facilities, indentures governing our seniornotes and agreements governing our other indebtedness will be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control. Complying with our covenants may also causeus to take actions that are not favorable to us and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete, including against companies that are not subject tosuch restrictions.  We are subject to laws, regulations and potential liability relating to claims, complaints and proceedings, including those relating to environmental and other matters.          We are subject to various laws, ordinances, regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the UnitedStates and other nations. With respect to acquisitions, divestitures and continuing operations, we may acquire or retain liabilities of which we are not aware, or of a different character or magnitudethan expected. Additionally, changes in laws, ordinances, regulations or other governmental policies may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities.         Weface environmental exposures including, for example, those relating to discharges from and materials handled as part of our operations, the remediation of soil and groundwatercontaminated by petroleum products or hazardous substances or wastes, and the health and safety of our employees. We may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardoussubstances or petroleum products on, under, or in our current or formerly owned or leased property, or from a third-party disposal facility that we may have used, without regard to whether we knew of,or caused, the presence of the contaminants. The presence of, or failure to properly remediate, these substances may have adverse effects, including, for example, substantial investigative or remedialobligations and limitations on the ability to sell or rent affected property or to borrow funds using affected property as collateral. New or existing environmental matters or changes in environmentallaws or policies could lead to material costs for environmental compliance or cleanup. There can be no assurance that these liabilities and costs will not have a material adverse effect on ourfinancial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.         Weface numerous claims, complaints and proceedings. Class actions, derivative lawsuits and contract, intellectual property, competitive, personal injury, product liability, workers'compensation, safety regulatory, and other claims have been filed against us and certain of our subsidiaries and some of these remain pending. From time to time, we face actions by governmentalauthorities, both in and outside the United States. Additionally, we may become subject to significant claims, of which we are currently unaware, or the claims, of which we are aware, may result inour incurring a significantly greater liability than we anticipate. Our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures. We have increased ourself-insurance limits over the past several years, which has increased our uninsured exposure.         Wedevote significant time and expense to defense against the various claims, complaints and proceedings brought against us, and we cannot assure that the expenses or distractions fromoperating our businesses arising from these defenses will not increase materially. 10         Wecannot assure you that our accruals and right to indemnity and insurance will be sufficient, that recoveries from insurance or indemnification claims will be available or that any ofour current or future claims or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See ""MD&A  Critical AccountingPolicies and Use of Estimates  Contingent Liabilities.""  Changes in tax laws and regulations or other factors could cause our income tax rate to increase, potentially reducing our net income and adversely affecting our cash flows.          As a global manufacturing company, we are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions around the world. In preparingour financial statements, we calculate our effective income tax rate based on current tax laws and regulations and the estimated taxable income within each of these jurisdictions. Our effective incometax rate, however, may be higher due to numerous factors, including changes in tax laws or regulations. An effective income tax rate significantly higher than our expectations could have an adverseeffect on our business, results of operations, and liquidity.         Officialsin some of the jurisdictions in which we do business, including the United States, have proposed, or announced that they are reviewing, tax increases and other revenue raisinglaws and regulations. For example, over the last year, the United States government has proposed several initiatives that would have the effect of increasing U.S. tax rates for companies withunrepatriated foreign earnings. Any resulting changes in tax laws or regulations could impose new restrictions, costs or prohibitions on our current practices and reduce our net income and adverselyaffect our cash flows.  The price and availability of raw materials may adversely affect our results.          We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including inflation in the prices and shortages of raw materials. Inrecent years, we have faced significant volatility in the prices of many of our key raw materials, including petroleum-based products, steel and copper. Increases in the prices of raw materials orshortages or allocations of materials may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as we may not be able to pass cost increases on to ourcustomers, or our sales may be reduced. Occasionally we are subject to long-term supplier contracts which may increase our exposure to pricing fluctuations.  Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could have a negative effect on our operations; our acquisitions could cause financial difficulties.          Our acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges,including: Adverse effects on our reported operating results due to charges to earnings, including impairment charges associated withgoodwill and other intangibles;   Diversion of management attention from running our businesses;   Integration of technology, operations, personnel and financial and other systems;   Increased expenses;   Increased foreign operations, often with unique issues relating to corporate culture, compliance with legal and regulatoryrequirements and other challenges;   Assumption of known and unknown liabilities and exposure to litigation;   Increased levels of debt or dilution to existing shareholders; and   Potential disputes with the sellers of acquired businesses, technology, services or products.         Inaddition, internal controls over financial reporting of acquired companies may not be up to required standards. Issues may exist that could rise to the level of significantdeficiencies or, in some cases, material weaknesses, particularly with respect to foreign companies or non-public U.S. companies.         Ourintegration activities may place substantial demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. Customer dissatisfaction or performanceproblems with an acquired business, technology, service or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.  We may not achieve the expected cost savings and other benefits of our acquisitions.          We strive for and expect to achieve cost savings in connection with our acquisitions, including:(i) manufacturing process and supply chain rationalization; (ii) streamlining redundant administrative overhead and support activities; and (iii) restructuring and repositioningsales and marketing organizations to eliminate redundancies. Cost savings expectations 11 areestimates that are inherently difficult to predict and are necessarily speculative in nature, and we cannot assure you that we will achieve expected, or any, cost savings. In addition, we cannotassure you that unforeseen factors will not offset the estimated cost savings or other benefits from our acquisitions. As a result, anticipated benefits could be delayed, differ significantly from ourestimates and the other information contained in this report, or not be realized.  Our failure to successfully complete acquisitions could negatively affect us.          We may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions, which could materially impact our growth rate, results ofoperations, future cash flows and stock price. Our ability to achieve our goals depends upon, among other things, our ability to identify and successfully acquire companies, businesses and productlines, to effectively integrate them and to achieve cost effectiveness. We may also be unable to raise any additional funds necessary to consummate these acquisitions. In addition, decreases in ourstock price may adversely affect our ability to consummate acquisitions. Competition for acquisitions in our business areas may be significant and result in higher prices for businesses, includingbusinesses that we may target, which may also affect our acquisition rate or benefits achieved from our acquisitions.  We operate in highly competitive industries. Our failure to compete effectively could harm our business.          We operate in a highly competitive environment, competing on the basis of product offerings, technical capabilities,quality, service and pricing. We have a number of competitors, some of which are large, with substantial technological and financial resources, brand recognition and established relationships withglobal service providers. Some of our competitors have low cost structures, support from governments in their home countries, or both. In addition, new competitors may enter the industry. Competitorsmay be able to offer lower prices, additional products or services or a more attractive mix of products or services, or services or other incentives that we cannot or will not match. These competitorsmay be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new or emerging technologies and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, and make more attractive offers to potentialcustomers, employees and strategic partners.  Our strategy to outsource various elements of the products we sell subjects us to the business risks of our suppliers, which could have a material adverse impact on ouroperations.          In areas where we depend on third-party suppliers for outsourced products or components, we are subject to the risk ofcustomer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of the products we sell due to supplier failure. In addition, business difficulties experienced by a third-party supplier can lead to theinterruption of our ability to obtain the outsourced product and ultimately our inability to supply products to our customers. Third-party supplier business interruptions can include, but are notlimited to, work stoppages and union negotiations and other labor disputes. Current economic conditions could impact the ability of suppliers to access credit and, thus, impair their ability toprovide us quality product in a timely manner, or at all.  Changes in key estimates and assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed long-term return on assets, assumed long-term trends of future cost, andaccounting and legislative changes as well as actual investment returns on our pension plan assets and other actuarial factors, could affect our results of operations and cash flows.          We have defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, including both qualified and non-qualified plans,that cover a portion of our salaried and hourly employees and retirees including a portion of our employees and retirees in foreign countries. As of December 31, 2009, these plans wereunderfunded by $594.0. The determination of funding requirements and pension expense or income associated with these plans involves significant judgment, particularly with respect to discount rates,long-term returns on assets, long-term trends of future costs and other actuarial assumptions. If our assumptions change significantly due to changes in economic, legislativeand/or demographic experience or circumstances, our pension and other benefit plans' expense, funded status and our cash contributions to such plans could be negatively impacted. In addition, thedifference between our actual investment returns and our long-term return on assets assumptions could result in a change to our pension plans' expense, funded status and our requiredcontributions to the plans. Changes in regulations or law could also significantly impact our obligations. For example, See ""MD&A  Critical Accounting Policies and Use ofEstimates"" for the impact that changes in certain assumptions used in the calculation of our costs and obligations associated with these plans could have on our results of operations and financialposition.  Dispositions or our failure to successfully complete dispositions could negatively affect us.          Our dispositions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, includingdiversion of management attention from running our core businesses, increased expense associated with the dispositions, potential disputes with the customers or suppliers of the disposed businesses,potential disputes with the acquirers of the 12 disposedbusinesses and a potential dilutive effect on our earnings per share. If dispositions are not completed in a timely manner there may be a negative effect on our cash flows and/or our abilityto execute our strategy. See""Business"", ""MD&A  Results of Discontinued Operations"", and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for the status of our divestitures.  Increases in the number of shares of our outstanding common stock could adversely affect our common stock price or dilute our earnings per share.          Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock into the public market, or the perception that these salescould occur, could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 0.881 shares of our common stock were issuable upon exercise of outstanding stockoptions by employees and non-employee directors and we had the ability to issue up to an additional 5.555 shares as restricted stock, restricted stock units, or stock options under our2002 Stock Compensation Plan, as amended in 2006. Additionally, we may issue a significant number of additional shares, in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. We also have a shelf registrationstatement for 8.3 shares of common stock that may be issued in connection with acquisitions. Additional shares issued will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share.  The loss of key personnel and any inability to attract and retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations.          We are dependent on the continued services of our leadership team. The loss of these personnel without adequatereplacement could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience in manylocations, in order to operate our business successfully. From time to time, there may be a shortage of skilled labor, which may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retainqualified employees. If we were unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals or our costs to do so were to increase significantly, our operations could be materiallyadversely affected.  Cost reduction actions may affect our business.          Cost reduction actions often result in charges against earnings. We expect to take charges against earnings in 2010 inconnection with implementing additional cost reduction actions at certain of our businesses. These charges can vary significantly from period to period and, as a result, we may experience fluctuationsin our reported net income and earnings per share due to the timing of restructuring actions, which in turn can have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cashflows.  If the fair value of any of our reporting units is insufficient to recover the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangibles of the respective reporting unit, amaterial non-cash charge to earnings could result.          At December 31, 2009, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net of $2,308.3. We conduct annual impairmenttesting to determine if we will be able to recover all or a portion of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. In addition, we review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibleassets for impairment more frequently if impairment indicators arise. If the fair value is insufficient to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, we may berequired to record a material non-cash charge to earnings.         Thefair values of our reporting units generally are based on discounted cash flow projections that are believed to be reasonable under current and forecasted circumstances, the resultsof which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of the reported net assets of our reporting units. Other considerations are also incorporated, including comparable industry pricemultiples. Many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end-markets that they serve. Accordingly, we consider estimates and judgments that affect the future cashflow projections, including principal methods of competition such as volume, price, service, product performance and technical innovations and estimates associated with cost improvement initiatives,capacity utilization, and assumptions for inflation and foreign currency changes. We monitor impairment indicators across all of our businesses. Significant changes in market conditions and estimatesor judgments used to determine expected future cash flows that indicate a reduction in carrying value may give, and have given, rise to impairments in the period that the change becomes known.  We are subject to work stoppages, union negotiations, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force, which may adversely impact our operations and causeus to incur incremental costs.          At December 31, 2009, we had approximately 15,000 employees. Nine domestic collective bargaining agreementscover approximately 1,000 employees. We also have various collective labor arrangements covering certain non-U.S. employee groups. We are subject to potential union campaigns, workstoppages, union negotiations and other potential labor disputes. Further, we may be subject to work stoppages, which are beyond our control, at our suppliers or customers. 13  We could be affected by laws or regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change.          Changes in laws or regulations enacted in response to concerns over potential climate change could increase our costsor impact markets for our products. However, we cannot currently estimate the effects, if any, of changes in climate change-related laws or regulations on our business.  Our technology is important to our success, and failure to develop new products may result in a significant competitive disadvantage.          We believe that the development and protection of our intellectual property rights is critical to the success of ourbusiness. In order to maintain our market positions and margins, we need to continually develop and introduce high quality, technologically advanced and cost effective products on a timely basis, inmany cases in multiple jurisdictions around the world. The failure to do so could result in a significant competitive disadvantage.         Additionally,despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. The steps wehave taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. Expenses inconnection with defending our rights may be material.  If we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted.          We are increasingly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process,transmit and store electronic information. In particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and between ourpersonnel and suppliers and customers. Security breaches of this infrastructure can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If we are unable toprevent such breaches, our operations could be disrupted or we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information.  Our current and planned products may contain defects or errors that are detected only after delivery to customers. If that occurs, our reputation may be harmed and we mayface additional costs.          We cannot assure you that our product development, manufacturing and integration testing will be adequate to detect alldefects, errors, failures and quality issues that could impact customer satisfaction or result in claims against us with regard to our products. As a result, we may have, and from time to time havehad, to replace certain components and/or provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects in products that are shipped. The occurrence of any defects, errors, failures or quality issuescould result in cancellation of orders, product returns, diversion of our resources, legal actions by our customers or our customers' end users and other losses to us or to our customers or end users,and could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and loss of sales, which would harm our business and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.  Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company, and accordingly, we may not consummate a transaction that ourshareholders consider favorable.          Provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws may inhibit changes in control of our companynot approved by our Board. These provisions include, for example: a staggered board of directors; a prohibition on shareholder action by written consent; a requirement that special shareholdermeetings be called only by our Chairman, President or Board; advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations; limitations on shareholders' ability to amend, alter or repeal theBy-laws; enhanced voting requirements for certain business combinations involving substantial shareholders; the authority of our Board to issue, without shareholder approval, preferredstock with terms determined in its discretion; and limitations on shareholders ability to remove directors. In addition, we are afforded the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware GeneralCorporation Law, which could have similar effects. In general, Section 203 prohibits us from engaging in a ""business combination"" with an ""interested shareholder"" (each as defined inSection 203) for at least three years after the time the person became an interested shareholder unless certain conditions are met. These protective provisions could result in our notconsummating a transaction that our shareholders consider favorable or discourage entities from attempting to acquire us, potentially at a significant premium to our then-existing stockprice. 14"

(All amountsare in millions, except per share data)You should consider the risks described below and elsewhere in ourdocuments filed with the SEC before investing in any of our securities. Thoughwe undertake no obligation to do so, we may amend, supplement or add to therisk factors described below from time to time in future reports filed with theSEC.Difficulties presented by internationaleconomic, political, legal, accounting, and business factors could negativelyaffect our interests and business effort.In 2006, approximately 40% of our revenues were generated outside theUnited States. Revenues originating from business units in Germany and theUnited Kingdom in 2006 were $624.2 and $243.4, respectively. We continue toincrease our sales outside the United States, with a particular emphasis onexpanding our presence in emerging markets, most notably China. As part of ourstrategy, we manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide, many ofwhich are located outside the United States. Our international operationsrequire us to comply with the legal requirements of foreign jurisdictions andexpose us to the political consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions.Our foreign business operations also are subject to the following risks:·       difficulty in managing,operating and marketing our international operations because of distance, aswell as language and cultural differences;6 ·       difficulty entering newinternational markets due to differing regulatory barriers, political systemsor other barriers to business;·       increased costs due todomestic and foreign customs and tariffs, potentially adverse tax consequences,including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittancesand other payments by subsidiaries, and transportation and shipping expenses;·       credit risk or financialcondition of local customers and distributors;·       difficulties in staffingand labor disputes;·       nationalization of privateenterprises;·       government embargos orforeign trade restrictions such as anti-dumping duties;·       increased costs oftransportation or shipping;·       environmental and otherlaws and regulations;·       ability to obtain suppliesfrom foreign vendors and ship products internationally during times of crisisor otherwise;·       difficulties in protectingintellectual property;·       local, regional orworldwide hostilities;·       potential imposition ofrestrictions on investments; and·       local political, economicand social conditions, including the possibility of hyperinflationaryconditions and political instability.A significantand growing portion of our products are manufactured in lower-cost locationsand sold in various countries. Cross border transactions, both with externalparties and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to foreignexchange effects. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase theeffective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars, which may have a materialadverse effect on sales or require us to lower our prices and also decrease ourreported revenues or margins in respect of sales conducted in foreigncurrencies to the extent we are unable or determine not to increase localcurrency prices. Likewise, decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could have amaterial adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchasedoverseas. In addition, our sales are translated into U.S. dollars for reportingpurposes. In particular, a revaluation of the Chinese Yuan could result in anincrease in the cost of producing products in China, or increases in laborcosts. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorabletranslation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated intoU.S. dollars.As we continue to expand our international operations, these and otherrisks associated with international operations are likely to increase. Inaddition, as we enter new geographic markets, we may encounter significantcompetition from the primary participants in those markets who may havesignificantly greater market knowledge and substantially greater resources thanwe do. In particular, as an increasing percentage of our products aremanufactured in China, health conditions and other factors affecting social andeconomic activity in China and affecting the movement of people and productsinto and from China to our major markets, including North America and Europe,could have a significant negative affect on our operations. Also, theimposition of trade sanctions by the United States or the European Unionagainst a class of products imported by us from, or the loss of normal traderelations status with, China or other countries in which we conduct businesscould significantly increase our cost of products imported into the UnitedStates or Europe and harm our business. Because of the importance of ourinternational sales and international sourcing of manufacturing to ourbusiness, if any of the risks described above were to occur it could have amaterial adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations orcash flows.We are subjectto laws, regulations and potential liability relating to claims, complaints andproceedings, including those relating to environmental and other matters.We are subject to various laws, ordinances, regulations and otherrequirements of government authorities in the United States and other nations.With respect to acquisitions, divestitures and continuing operations, we mayacquire or retain liabilities of which we are not aware, or of a differentcharacter or magnitude than expected. Additionally, changes in laws,ordinances, regulations or other governmental policies may significantlyincrease our expenses and liabilities.We face environmental exposures including, for example, those relatingto discharges from and materials handled as part of our operations, theremediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by petroleum products orhazardous 7 substances or wastes, and the health andsafety of our employees. We may be liable for the costs of investigation,removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances or petroleum productson, under, or in our current or formerly owned property, or from a third-partydisposal facility which we may have used, without regard to whether we knew of,or caused, the presence of the contaminants. The presence of, or failure toremediate properly, these substances may have adverse effects, including, forexample, substantial investigative or remedial obligations and limitations onthe ability to sell or rent affected property or to borrow funds using affectedproperty as collateral. New or existing environmental matters or changes inenvironmental laws or policies could lead to material costs for environmentalcompliance or cleanup. There can be no assurance that these liabilities andcosts will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position,results of operations or cash flows. See Note 14 to our consolidatedfinancial statements for further discussion.We face numerous claims, complaints and proceedings. Class actions,derivative lawsuits and contract, intellectual property, competitive, personalinjury, product liability, workers compensation and other claims have beenfiled or are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries. In addition wefrom time to time face actions by governmental authorities, both in and outsidethe United States. Additionally, we may become subject to significant claims ofwhich we are currently unaware or the claims of which we are aware may resultin our incurring a significantly greater liability than we anticipate. Ourinsurance may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potentialloss exposures. In addition, we have been increasing our self-insurance limitsover the past several years, which has increased our uninsured exposure.We devote significant time and expense to defense against the variousclaims, complaints and proceedings brought against us, and we cannot assure youthat the expenses or distractions from operating our businesses arising fromthese defenses will not increase materially.We cannot assure you that our accruals and right to indemnity andinsurance will be sufficient, that recoveries from insurance or indemnificationclaims will be available or that any of our current or future claims or othermatters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position,results of operations or cash flows. See MD&A  Critical AccountingPolicies and Use of Estimates  Contingent Liabilities.The price of rawmaterials may adversely affect our results.We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including inflation in theprices of raw materials. In the last three years, we have faced significantchanges in the prices of many of our key raw materials, including petroleum-basedproducts, steel, and copper. Increases in the prices of raw materials may havea material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations orcash flows, as we may not be able to pass cost increases on to our customers.We operate inhighly competitive industries. Our failure to compete effectively could harmour business.We operate in a highly competitive environment, competing on the basisof product offerings, technical capabilities, quality, service and pricing. We havea number of competitors, some of which are large, with substantialtechnological and financial resources, brand recognition and establishedrelationships with global service providers. Some of our competitors have lowcost structures, support from governments in their home countries, or both. Inaddition, new competitors may enter the industry. We cannot assure you that wewill be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors.Competitors may be able to offer lower prices, additional products or servicesor a more attractive mix of products or services, or services or otherincentives that we cannot or will not match or do not offer. These competitorsmay be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new or emerging technologiesand may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, and make moreattractive offers to potential customers, employees and strategic partners.Our strategy tooutsource various elements of the products we sell subjects us to the businessrisks of our suppliers, which could have a material adverse impact on ouroperations.In areas where we depend on third-party suppliers for outsourcedproducts or components, we are subject to the risk of customer dissatisfactionwith the quality or performance of the products we sell because of supplierfailure. In addition, business difficulties experienced by a third-partysupplier can lead to the interruption of our ability to obtain the outsourcedproduct and ultimately our inability to supply products to our customers. Third-partysupplier business interruptions can include, but are not limited to, workstoppages, union negotiations and other labor disputes, as well as financialand credit difficulties.8 A portion ofour revenues is generated through long-term fixed-price contracts, whichcould expose us to various risks including the risks of cost overruns,inflation and credit and other counterparty risks.A portion of our revenues and earnings is generated through long-termfixed-price contracts. We recognize revenues from certain of thesecontracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting wherebyrevenue and expenses, and thereby profit, in a given period are determinedbased on our estimates as to the project status and the costs remaining tocomplete a particular project. Estimates of total revenues and cost atcompletion are subject to many variables, including the length of time tocomplete a contract. To the extent that we under-estimate the remainingcost to complete a project, we may overstate the revenues and profit in aparticular period. Further, certain of these contracts provide for penaltiesfor failure to timely perform our obligations under a contract, or require thatwe, at our expense, correct and remedy to the satisfaction of the other partycertain defects. Because some of our long-term contracts are at a fixed price,we face the risk that cost overruns or inflation may erode, eliminate or exceedour expected profit margin, or cause us to take a loss on our projects. Additionally,even though we perform credit checks and conduct other due diligence on thosewith whom we do business, customers of our long-term contracts may sufferfinancial difficulties that make them unable to pay for a project whencompleted or they may decide, either as a matter of corporate decision-makingor in response to changes in local laws and regulations, not to pay us. Wecannot assure you that expenses or losses for uncollectible billings relatingto our long-term fixed-price contracts will not have a material adverseeffect on our revenues and earnings.Changes in boththe funding of and accounting for pension and postretirement benefit plans mayaffect our results of operations and cash flows.As of December 31, 2006, our defined benefit pension andpostretirement plans, including both qualified and non-qualified plans, wereunderfunded by $380.9. Of this amount, $42.8 related to our domestic qualifieddefined benefit pension plans. During 2006, the United States government passedinto law the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). Among other things, thePPA requires plan sponsors to fund toward 100% of the underfunded status ofdomestic qualified defined benefit pension plans (with contributions phased inthrough 2011) and increased the annual premiums we pay to the Pension BenefitGuaranty Corporation. Additionally, during 2006, the Financial AccountingStandards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other PostretirementPlans  an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFASNo. 158). This statement required us to recognize the underfunded statusof our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in our consolidatedbalance sheet as of December 31, 2006. SFAS No. 158 represents theculmination of phase one of the FASBs project to re-address the accounting fordefined benefit pension and postretirement plans, with the second phase of theproject focused on the recognition of expense in the financial statements. Asthe specific annual funding requirements resulting from the PPA are not yetknown, and the FASBs project is ongoing, we are currently unable to accuratelypredict their impact on our future results of operations or cash flows. See MD&A Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates for the impact that changesin certain assumptions used in the calculation of our costs and obligationsassociated with these plans could have on our results of operations andfinancial position. Furthermore, future changes in the funding of, accountingfor, or other regulatory changes could have adverse impacts on our results ofoperation and cash flows. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statementsfor the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006.Our failure to successfully completeacquisitions could negatively affect us.We may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions, which couldmaterially impact our growth rate, results of operations, cash flows and stockprice. Our ability to achieve our goals depends upon, among other things, ourability to identify and successfully acquire companies, businesses and productlines, to effectively integrate them and to achieve cost effectiveness. We mayalso be unable to raise any additional funds necessary to consummate theseacquisitions. In addition, changes in our stock price may adversely affect ourability to consummate acquisitions. Competition for acquisitions in ourbusiness areas has been significant, and has in many cases resulted in higherprices for businesses, including businesses that we may target, which may alsoaffect our acquisition rate or benefits achieved from our acquisitions.9Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could have anegative effect on our operations; our acquisitions could cause financialdifficulties.As part of our business strategy, we evaluate potential acquisitions inthe ordinary course, some of which could be and have been material. Ouracquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial andoperational challenges, including:·       adverse effects on ourreported operating results due to charges to earnings, including impairment chargesassociated with goodwill and other intangibles;·       diversion of managementattention from running our businesses;·       integration of technology,operations, personnel and financial and other systems;·       increased expenses,including compensation expenses resulting from newly hired employees;·       increased foreignoperations, often with unique issues relating to corporate culture, compliancewith legal and regulatory requirements and other challenges;·       assumption of known andunknown liabilities and exposure to litigation;·       increased levels of debt ordilution to existing shareholders; and·       potential disputes with thesellers of acquired businesses, technology, services or products.In addition,internal controls over financial reporting of acquired companies may not be upto required standards. Issues may exist that could rise to the level ofsignificant deficiencies or, in some cases, material weaknesses, particularlywith respect to foreign companies or non-public United States companies.Our integration activities may place substantial demands on ourmanagement, operational resources and financial and internal control systems.Customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business,technology, service or product could also have a material adverse effect on ourreputation and business. In addition, any acquired business, technology,service or product could under-perform relative to our expectations.We may notachieve the expected cost savings and other benefits of our acquisitions.We strive for and expect to achieve cost savings in connection with ouracquisitions, including: (i) manufacturing process and supply chainrationalization, including plant closings in some cases; (ii) streamliningredundant administrative overhead and support activities; and (iii) restructuringand repositioning sales and marketing organizations to eliminate redundancies.Cost savings expectations are inherently estimates that are difficult topredict and are necessarily speculative in nature, and we cannot assure you thatwe will achieve expected, or any, cost savings. In addition, we cannot assureyou that unforeseen factors will not offset the estimated cost savings or otherbenefits from our acquisitions. As a result, our actual cost savings, if any,and other anticipated benefits could be delayed and could significantly differfrom our estimates and the other information contained in this report.Our failure tosuccessfully complete dispositions could negatively us.We continually review each of our businesses in order to determinetheir long term strategic fit. As part of this strategy, we dispose of certainof our businesses in the ordinary course, some of which dispositions could beand have been material. Our dispositions involve a number of risks and presentfinancial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion ofmanagement attention from running our core businesses, increased expenseassociated with the dispositions and potential disputes with the acquirers ofthe disposed assets or businesses. If dispositions are not completed in atimely manner there may be a negative effect on our cash flows and/or ourability to execute our strategy. See Item 1. Business and Note 4 to ourconsolidated financial statements for the status of our divestitures.Increases in the number of shares of our outstanding common stock couldadversely affect our common stock price or dilute our earnings per share.Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock into the publicmarket, or the perception that these sales could occur, could have a materialadverse effect on our stock price. As of December 31, 2006, approximately4.8 shares of our common stock were issuable upon exercise of outstanding stockoptions by employees and non-employee directors and we had the ability to issueup to an additional 6.5 shares as restricted stock, restricted stock units, orstock options under our 2002 Stock Compensation Plan. Additionally, we mayissue a significant number of additional shares, in 10 connection with acquisitions or otherwise. Wealso have a shelf registration statement for 4.3 shares of common stock thatmay be issued in connection with acquisitions, and we have a shelf registrationstatement for a total of $1,000.0, which may be used in connection with anoffering of debt securities, preferred securities and/or common stock forgeneral corporate purposes. Additional shares issued will have a dilutiveeffect on our earnings per share.Ourindebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operatingflexibility.At December 31, 2006, we had $964.6 in total indebtedness. On thatsame date, we had $255.4 of available borrowing capacity under our revolvingcredit facilities after giving effect to borrowings under our global revolvingloan facility of $82.8 and to $111.8 reserved for outstanding letters of credit.In addition, we had $143.0 of available issuance capacity under our foreigntrade facility after giving effect to $332.0 reserved for outstanding lettersof credit. At December 31, 2006, our cash and equivalents balance was$477.2. See MD&A and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statementsfor further discussion. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future,including indebtedness incurred to finance, or which is assumed in connectionwith, acquisitions. We may in the future renegotiate or refinance our seniorcredit facilities, or enter into additional agreements that have different ormore stringent terms. The level of our indebtedness could:·       limit cash flow availablefor general corporate purposes, such as acquisitions and capital expenditures,due to the ongoing cash flow requirements for debt service;·       limit our ability toobtain, or obtain on favorable terms, additional debt financing in the futurefor working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions;·       limit our flexibility inreacting to competitive and other changes in the industry and economicconditions;·       expose us to a risk that asubstantial decrease in net operating cash flows due to economic developmentsor adverse developments in our business could make it difficult to meet debtservice requirements; and·       expose us to risks inherentin interest rate fluctuations to the extent existing borrowings are, and anynew borrowings may be at variable rates of interest, which could result inhigher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates.Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal, to pay intereston, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligationswill depend upon our future operating performance, which will be affected bygeneral economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business andother factors beyond our control. In addition, we cannot assure you that futureborrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancingof our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, whether inthe ordinary course of business or upon acceleration of such indebtedness, wemay pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as restructuring orrefinancing our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capitalexpenditures, revising implementation of or delaying strategic plans or seekingadditional equity capital. Any of these actions could have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Inaddition, we cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of theseactions, that these actions would enable us continue to satisfy our capitalrequirements, or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of ourvarious debt agreements.We may not be able to finance future needs or adapt our business planto react to changes in economic or business conditions because of restrictionsplaced on us by our senior credit facilities and any existing or futureinstruments governing our other indebtedness.Our seniorcredit facilities and other agreements governing our other indebtednesscontain, or may contain, a number of significant restrictions and covenantsthat limit our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investorsand creditors unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied.We also must comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests. Oursubsidiaries may also be subject to restrictions on their ability to makedistributions to us. In addition, our senior credit facilities and any otheragreements contain or may contain additional affirmative and negativecovenants. Existing restrictions are described more fully under MD&A. Eachof these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and maylimit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities, suchas acquisitions.If we do not comply with the covenants and restrictions contained inour senior credit facilities and other agreements governing our indebtedness,we could be in default under those agreements, and the debt, together withaccrued interest, could then be declared immediately due and payable. If wedefault under our senior credit facilities, the lenders could cause all ouroutstanding debt obligations under our senior credit facilities to become dueand payable or require us to apply all of our cash to repay the indebtedness weowe. If our debt is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt orrefinance it. 11 Even if we are able to obtain new financing,we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinanceit. In addition, any default under our senior credit facilities or agreementsgoverning our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt underother debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-defaultprovisions. If the indebtedness under our senior credit facilities isaccelerated, we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due under oursenior credit facilities, senior notes or other debt securities thenoutstanding. Our ability to comply with these provisions of our senior creditfacilities and other agreements governing our other indebtedness will beaffected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other eventsbeyond our control. Complying with our covenants may also cause us to takeactions that are not favorable to us and may make it more difficult for us tosuccessfully execute our business strategy and compete, including againstcompanies that are not subject to such restrictions.The loss of key personnel and any inability to attract and retainqualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations.We are dependent on the continued services of our leadership team. Theloss of these personnel without adequate replacement could have a materialadverse effect on our operations. Additionally, we need qualified managers andskilled employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience in orderto operate our business successfully. From time to time, there may be ashortage of skilled labor, which may make it more difficult and expensive forus to attract and retain qualified employees. If we were unable to attract andretain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals or our costs to do so wereto increase significantly, our operations could be materially adverselyaffected.Many of theindustries in which we operate are cyclical, and our results will be and havebeen affected as a result.Many of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specificindustry and general economic cycles. Certain businesses are subject toindustry cycles, including, but not limited to:·       The electric power andinfrastructure markets, which influence our Thermal Equipment and Services andIndustrial Products and Services segments.·       Demand for cooling systemsand towers within our Thermal Equipment and Services segment is correlated tocontract timing on large construction contracts, which may cause significantfluctuations from period to period. Accordingly, any downturn or competitivepricing pressures in those or other markets in which we participate couldadversely affect us.·       The chemical andpetrochemical markets, which influence our Flow Technology segment.Cyclical changes could also affect sales of products in our otherbusinesses. The downturns in the business cycles of our different operationsmay occur at the same time, which could exacerbate any material adverse effectsto our business. See MD&A  Segment Results of Operations. Inaddition, certain of our businesses have seasonal fluctuations. Historically,our businesses generally tend to be stronger in the second half of the year.Our business issubject to changes in the economy.Certain of our businesses have been affected in various years bydifficult economic conditions. There can be no assurance that the economy willnot worsen or that we will be able to sustain existing cost structures orcreate additional cost reductions to offset economic conditions, or that theunpredictability and changes in the markets in which we participate will notadversely impact our results. Cost reduction actions often result in chargesagainst earnings. We expect to take charges against earnings in 2007 inconnection with implementing additional cost reduction actions at certain ofour businesses. These charges can vary significantly from period to period and,as a result, we may experience fluctuations in our reported net income andearnings per share due to the timing of restructuring actions, which in turncan have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results ofoperations or cash flows.If the fair value of any of our reporting units is insufficient torecover the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangibles of therespective reporting unit, a material non-cash charge to earnings could result.In two of thepast three years we have recorded material non-cash charges to earnings toimpair the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets. At December 31,2006, we had goodwill and other intangible assets of $2,250.2. We account forgoodwill and indefinite lived intangibles in accordance with SFAS No. 142,Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142). SFAS No. 142states that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized,but are instead reviewed for impairment annually (or more frequently ifimpairment indicators arise). We conduct annual impairment testing to determineif we will be able to recover all or a portion of the carrying value ofgoodwill and indefinite lived 12 intangibles. In addition, we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangibleassets for impairment more frequently if impairment indicators arise. If thefair value is insufficient to recover the carrying value of our goodwill andindefinite lived intangibles, we may be required to record a material non-cashcharge to earnings.Consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 142, the fair valuesof our reporting units generally are based on discounted cash flow projectionsthat are believed to be reasonable under current and forecasted circumstances,the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying valuesof the reported net assets of our reporting units. Other considerations arealso incorporated, including comparable industry price multiples. Many of ourbusinesses closely follow changes in the industries and end-markets that theyserve. Accordingly, we consider estimates and judgments that affect the futurecash flow projections, including principal methods of competition such asvolume, price, service, product performance and technical innovations and estimatesassociated with cost improvement initiatives, capacity utilization, andassumptions for inflation and foreign currency changes. We monitor impairmentindicators across all of our businesses. Any significant change in marketconditions and estimates or judgments used to determine expected future cashflows that indicate a reduction in carrying value may give rise to impairmentin the period that the change becomes known.We are subject to work stoppages, union negotiations, labor disputesand other matters associated with our labor force, which may adversely impactour operations and cause us to incur incremental costs.At December 31, 2006, we had approximately 14,300 employeesassociated with businesses that have been classified in our consolidated financialstatements as continuing operations. Additionally, we had approximately 1,100employees associated with a business that we intend to sell in 2007 and haveclassified in our consolidated financial statements as a discontinuedoperation. Eleven domestic collective bargaining agreements cover approximately1,200 employees, none of which relate to the business classified in ourconsolidated financial statements as a discontinued operation. We also havevarious collective labor arrangements covering certain non-U.S. employee groups.We are subject to potential union campaigns, work stoppages, union negotiationsand other potential labor disputes. Further, we may be subject to workstoppages, which are beyond our control, at our suppliers or customers.Our technology is important to our success, and failure to develop newproducts may result in a significant competitive disadvantage.Because many ofour products rely on proprietary technology, we believe that the developmentand protection of our intellectual property rights is critical to the successof our business. In order to maintain our market positions and margins, we needto continually develop and introduce high quality, technologically advanced andcost effective products on a timely basis. The failure to do so could result ina significant competitive disadvantage.Additionally, despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights,unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use ourproducts or technology. The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorizeduse of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may notprotect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. Expenses inconnection with defending our rights may be material.Our current and planned products may contain defects or errors that aredetected only after delivery to customers. If that occurs, our reputation maybe harmed and we may face additional costs.There is no assurance that our product development, manufacturing andintegration testing will be adequate to detect all defects, errors, failuresand quality issues that could impact customer satisfaction or result in claimsagainst us with regard to our products. As a result, we may have to replace certaincomponents and/or provide remediation in response to the discovery of defectsin products that are shipped. The occurrence of any defects, errors, failuresor quality issues could result in cancellation of orders, product returns,diversion of our resources, legal actions by our customers or our customersend users and other losses to us or to our customers or end users, and couldalso result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products andloss of sales, which would harm our business and adversely affect our revenuesand profitability.Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law may delay orprevent a change in control of our company, and, accordingly, we may notconsummate a transaction that our shareholders consider favorable.Provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws may inhibitchanges in our control not approved by our Board. These provisions include, forexample: a staggered board of directors; a prohibition on shareholder action bywritten consent; a requirement that special shareholder meetings be called onlyby our Chairman, President or our Board; advance notice requirements for shareholderproposals and nominations; limitations on shareholders ability to amend, alteror repeal 13 the By-laws; enhanced voting requirements forcertain business combinations involving substantial shareholders; the authorityof our Board to issue, without shareholder approval, preferred stock with termsdetermined in its discretion; and limitations on shareholders ability to removedirectors. In addition, we are afforded the protections of Section 203 ofthe Delaware General Corporation Law, which could have similar effects. Ingeneral, Section 203 prohibits us from engaging in a business combinationwith an interested shareholder (each as defined in Section 203) for atleast three years after the time the person became an interested shareholderunless certain conditions are met. These protective provisions could result inour not consummating a transaction that our shareholders consider favorable ordiscourage entities from attempting to acquire us, potentially at a significantpremium to our then-existing stock price"
