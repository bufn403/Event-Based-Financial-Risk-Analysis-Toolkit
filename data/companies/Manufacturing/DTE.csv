There are various risks associated with the operations of the Registrants' utility businesses and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses.  To provide a framework to understand the operating environment of the Registrants, below is a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with their businesses.  Although the Registrants have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors, others could emerge in the future.  Each of the following risks could affect performance.Regulatory, Legislative, and Legal RisksThe Registrants are subject to rate regulation.  Electric and gas rates for the utilities are set by the MPSC and the FERC and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization.  The Registrants may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the MPSC, the FERC, or other regulatory bodies.  The Registrants' ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurring of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers' rates.  Regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers' rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under current governing laws and regulations.  Regulators may also disagree with the Registrants' rate calculations under the various mechanisms that are intended to mitigate the risk to their utilities related to certain aspects of the business.  If the Registrants cannot agree with regulators on an appropriate reconciliation of those mechanisms, it may impact the Registrants' ability to recover certain costs through customer rates.  Regulators may also decide to eliminate these mechanisms in future rate cases, which may make it more difficult for the Registrants to recover their costs in the rates charged to customers.  The Registrants cannot predict what rates the MPSC will authorize in future rate cases, and unfavorable rate relief could impact our plans for significant capital investment.  New legislation, regulations, or interpretations could change how the business operates, impact the Registrants' ability to recover costs through rates or the timing of such recovery, or require the Registrants to incur additional expenses.Changes to Michigan's electric retail access program could negatively impact the Registrants' financial performance.  The State of Michigan currently experiences a hybrid market, where the MPSC continues to regulate electric rates for DTE Electric customers, while alternative electric suppliers charge market-based rates.  MPSC rate orders, and energy legislation enacted by the State of Michigan, have placed a 10% cap on the total potential retail access migration.  However, even with the legislated 10% cap on participation, there continues to be legislative and financial risk associated with the electric retail access program.  Electric retail access migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes.  The Registrants are required under current regulation to provide full service to retail access customers that choose to return, potentially resulting in the need for additional generating capacity.Environmental laws and liability may be costly.  The Registrants are subject to, and affected by, numerous environmental regulations.  These regulations govern air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharge, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste.  Compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending, operating expenses, and plant down times, and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers.18Table of ContentsUncertainty around future environmental regulations creates difficulty planning long-term capital projects in the Registrants' generation fleet and for DTE Energy's gas distribution businesses.  These laws and regulations require the Registrants to seek a variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections, and other regulatory approvals.  The Registrants could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities, including the retirement of certain generating plants, based on these regulations.  Additionally, the Registrants may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body.  The Registrants cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs.  There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties.The Registrants may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues.  Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed in Michigan, the United States, and worldwide to reduce GHGs such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil fuels.  If increased regulations of GHG emissions are implemented, or if existing deadlines for these regulations are accelerated, the operations of DTE Electric's fossil-fueled generation assets may be significantly impacted.  Increased environmental regulation may also result in greater energy efficiency requirements and decreased demand at both the electric and gas utilities.  Since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process, the Registrants' financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters.Any perceived or alleged failure by the Registrants to comply with environmental regulations could lead to fines or penalties imposed by regulatory bodies or could result in adverse public statements and reputational damage affecting the Registrants.  Adverse statements, whether or not driven by political or public sentiment, may also result in investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in legal claims.The Renewable Portfolio Standard and energy waste reduction may affect the Registrants' business and federal and state fuel standards may affect DTE Energy's non-utility investments.  The Registrants are subject to existing Michigan, and potential future, federal legislation and regulation requiring them to secure sources of renewable energy.  The Registrants have complied with the existing federal and state legislation, but do not know what requirements may be added by federal or state legislation in the future.  In addition, the Registrants expect to comply with new Michigan legislation increasing the percentage of power required to be provided by renewable energy sources.  The Registrants cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with complying with potential future legislation and regulations.  Compliance with these requirements can significantly increase capital expenditures and operating expenses and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers.In addition, the Registrants are also required by Michigan legislation to implement energy waste reduction measures and provide energy waste reduction customer awareness and education programs.  These requirements necessitate expenditures, and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing the Registrants' revenues as customers decrease their energy usage.  The Registrants cannot predict how these programs will impact their business and future operating results.DTE Energy's non-utility renewable natural gas investments are also dependent on the federal Renewable Fuel Standard and California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard.  Changes to these standards may affect DTE Energy's business and result in lower earnings.DTE Energy's ability to utilize tax credits may be limited.  To promote U.S. climate initiatives, the Internal Revenue Code provides tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce energy from alternative sources.  The Registrants have generated tax credits from renewable energy generation and DTE Energy has generated tax credits from renewable gas recovery, reduced emission fuel, and gas production operations.  If the Registrants' tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an IRS audit or changes in tax law, there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact the Registrants' earnings and cash flows.Operational RisksThe Registrants' electric distribution system and DTE Energy's gas distribution system are subject to risks from their operation, which could reduce revenues, increase expenses, and have a material adverse effect on their business, financial position, and results of operations.  The Registrants' electric distribution and DTE Energy’s gas distribution systems are subject to many operational risks.  These operational systems and infrastructure have been in service for many years.  Equipment, even when maintained in accordance with good utility practices, is subject to operational failure, including events that are beyond the Registrants' control, and could require significant operation and maintenance expense or capital expenditures to operate efficiently.  Because the Registrants’ distribution systems are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of the Registrants’ systems could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties.19Table of ContentsConstruction and capital improvements to the Registrants' power facilities and DTE Energy's distribution systems subject them to risk.  The Registrants are managing ongoing, and planning future, significant construction and capital improvement projects at the Registrants' multiple power generation and distribution facilities and at DTE Energy's gas distribution system.  Many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond the Registrants' control, including the cost of materials and labor, subcontractor performance, timing and issuance of necessary permits or approvals (including required certificates from regulatory agencies), construction disputes, impediments to acquiring rights-of-way or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms, cost overruns, and weather conditions.  Failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect the Registrants' financial performance, operations, or expected investment returns at the affected facilities, businesses and development projects.Operation of a nuclear facility subjects the Registrants to risk.  Ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects the Registrants to significant additional risks.  These risks include, among others, plant security, environmental regulation and remediation, changes in federal nuclear regulation, increased capital expenditures to meet industry requirements, and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility compared to other generation options.  Insurance maintained by the Registrants for various nuclear-related risks may not be sufficient to cover the Registrants' costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at the nuclear generating plant, which may affect the Registrants' financial performance.  In addition, the Registrants' nuclear decommissioning trust fund, to finance the decommissioning of the nuclear generating plant, may not be sufficient to fund the cost of decommissioning.  A decline in market value of assets held in decommissioning trust funds due to poor investment performance or other factors may increase the funding requirements for these obligations.  Any increase in funding requirements may have a material impact on the Registrants’ liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.The supply and/or price of energy commodities and/or related services may impact the Registrants' financial results.  The Registrants are dependent on coal for much of their electrical generating capacity as well as uranium for their nuclear operations.  DTE Energy's access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for utility gas customers.  DTE Energy's non-utility businesses are also dependent upon supplies and prices of energy commodities and services.  Price fluctuations and changes in transportation costs, driven by inflation or other factors, as well as fuel supply disruptions, could have a negative impact on the amounts DTE Electric charges utility customers for electricity and DTE Gas charges utility customers for gas, and on the profitability of DTE Energy's non-utility businesses.  The Registrants' hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms may be insufficient to mitigate the negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices at their utility or DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, and the Registrants' financial performance may therefore be negatively impacted by price fluctuations.The price of energy also impacts the market for DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, particularly those that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers.  The price of environmental attributes generated by DTE Energy's renewable natural gas investments, including those related to the federal Renewable Fuel Standard and California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, may also impact the market and financial results for DTE Energy's non-utility businesses.The supply and/or price of other industrial raw and finished inputs and/or related services may impact the Registrants' financial results.  The Registrants are dependent on supplies of certain commodities, such as copper and limestone, among others, and industrial materials, and services in order to maintain day-to-day operations and maintenance of their facilities.  Price fluctuations, driven by inflation or other factors, or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items, could have a negative impact on the amounts charged to customers for the Registrants' utility products and, for DTE Energy, on the profitability of the non-utility businesses.Weather significantly affects operations.  As weather patterns exhibit increased deviations from historical trends, our utilities may experience financial and operational challenges.  Mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of the Registrants' assets, lowering income and cash flows.  At DTE Electric, high winds, floods, tornadoes, or ice storms can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities and require it to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses.  The expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process.  Prolonged and/or more frequent outages caused by increasingly extreme weather may result in decreased revenues and could also negatively impact DTE Energy's reputation and customer satisfaction or result in increased regulatory oversight.  Related damages to customer assets could subject DTE Energy to litigation.  DTE Gas can also experience higher than anticipated expenses from emergency repairs on its gas distribution infrastructure required as a result of weather-related issues.20Table of ContentsUnplanned power plant outages may be costly.  Unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations.  As a result of unforeseen maintenance, the Registrants may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed the costs of generation.  The Registrants' financial performance may be negatively affected if unable to recover such increased costs.A work interruption may adversely affect the Registrants.  There are several bargaining units for DTE Energy's approximately 4,900 and DTE Electric's approximately 2,550 represented employees.  The majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in 2027.  A union choosing to strike would have an impact on the Registrants' businesses.  The Registrants are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on their costs of operations and financial performance.DTE Energy may not achieve the carbon emissions goals of its electric and gas utilities.  DTE Energy has announced the voluntary commitments of its electric and gas utilities to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, along with intermediate emissions reduction goals at various points in the intervening years.  DTE Energy must also comply with the state of Michigan's requirement to meet a 100% clean energy standard by 2040.  Technology research and developments, innovations, and advancements are critical to DTE Energy's ability to achieve these commitments, but they may not evolve as anticipated in order to provide cost-effective alternatives to traditional energy sources.  State and municipal restrictions on the siting of renewable energy assets could also impair efforts to meet our stated targets.  Additionally, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to receive regulatory approval of our capital plans to transition to renewable energy and other new technologies.  Other factors that may impact DTE Energy's ability to achieve these emissions reduction goals include our service territory size and capacity needs remaining in line with current expectations, the impacts on our business of future regulations or legislation, the price and availability of carbon offsets, adoption of alternative energy products by the public such as greater use of electric vehicles, greater standardization of emissions reporting, and our ability over time to transition our electric generating portfolio.  DTE Energy's emissions reduction goals require making assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties.  Should one or more of these underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and ability to achieve our emissions reduction goals could differ materially from expectations.  In addition, DTE Energy cannot predict the ultimate impact of achieving these objectives, or the various implementation aspects on its reliability, availability or price of purchased power, or on its results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.  DTE Energy could suffer financial loss, reputational damage, litigation, or other negative repercussions if we are unable to meet our voluntary emissions reductions goals.Financial, Economic, and Market RisksDTE Energy's non-utility businesses may not perform to its expectations.  DTE Energy relies on non-utility businesses for a portion of earnings and will depend on the successful execution of new business development in its non-utilities to help achieve overall growth targets.  DTE Energy also expects to grow the non-utility businesses over the long-term by developing or acquiring projects related to renewable energy, carbon capture and sequestration, and customer energy solutions; however, such opportunities may not materialize as anticipated.  If DTE Energy's current and contemplated non-utility investments do not perform at expected levels, DTE Energy could experience diminished earnings and a corresponding decline in shareholder value.Adverse changes in the Registrants' credit ratings may negatively affect them.  Regional and national economic conditions, increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes, as well as changes in the Registrants' economic performance, could result in credit agencies reexamining their credit ratings.  While credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance, a downgrade in the Registrants' credit ratings below investment grade could restrict or discontinue their ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in their borrowing costs, a reduced level of capital expenditures, and could impact future earnings and cash flows.  In addition, a reduction in the Registrants' credit ratings may require them to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energy-related commodities, products, and services, which could impact their liquidity.21Table of ContentsPoor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact the Registrants' liquidity and results of operations.  The Registrants' costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation, and the Registrants' required or voluntary contributions made to the plans.  The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the Registrants' plans.  The Registrants have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations.  These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below the Registrants' projected return rates.  A decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding needs under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future.  Additionally, the pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  If interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding needs.  Also, if future increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from the Registrants' utility customers, the results of operations and financial position of the Registrants could be negatively affected.  Without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of plan assets, the Registrants could be required to fund these plans with significant amounts of cash.  Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on the Registrants' cash flows, financial position, or results of operations.The Registrants' ability to access capital markets is important.  The Registrants' ability to access capital markets is important to operate their businesses and to fund capital investments.  Turmoil in credit markets may constrain the ability of Registrants and their subsidiaries to issue new debt, including commercial paper, and to refinance existing debt. Macroeconomic events may lead to higher interest rates on debt and could increase financing costs and adversely affect the Registrants' results of operations.  Rising interest rates could also reduce investor interest in DTE Energy's common stock, negatively impacting its share price and increasing its cost of equity.  In addition, the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit the Registrants' access to capital markets.  The Registrants' long-term revolving credit facilities do not expire until 2027, but the Registrants regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects at the Registrants' utilities and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, and the Registrants cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions.Emerging technologies may have a material adverse effect on the Registrants.  Advances in technology that produce power or reduce power consumption include cost-effective renewable energy technologies, distributed generation, energy waste reduction technologies, and energy storage devices.  Such developments may impact the price of energy, may affect energy deliveries as customer-owned generation becomes more cost-effective, may require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands, and could make portions of our electric system power supply and/or distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives.  Such technologies could also result in further declines in commodity prices or demand for delivered energy.  Each of these factors could materially affect the Registrants’ results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.DTE Energy's participation in energy trading markets subjects it to risk.  Events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole.  In certain situations, DTE Energy may be required to post collateral to support trading operations, which could be substantial.  If access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed, DTE Energy could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows.  Energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose DTE Energy to risks related to commodity price movements, deviations in weather, and other related risks.  DTE Energy's trading business routinely has speculative trading positions in the market, within strict policy guidelines DTE Energy sets, resulting from the management of DTE Energy's business portfolio.  To the extent speculative trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish DTE Energy's financial results and financial position.  DTE Energy manages its exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures.  During periods of extreme volatility, these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities.Regional, national, and international economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on the Registrants.  The Registrants' utility and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers they serve and credit risk of counterparties they do business with.  Should the financial conditions of some of DTE Energy's significant customers deteriorate as a result of regional, national or international economic conditions, reduced volumes of electricity and gas, and demand for energy services DTE Energy supplies, collections of accounts receivable, reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding, and potentially higher levels of lost gas or stolen gas and electricity could result in decreased earnings and cash flows.22Table of ContentsIf DTE Energy's goodwill becomes impaired, it may be required to record a charge to earnings.  DTE Energy annually reviews the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions it has made for impairment.  Goodwill is also reviewed on a quarterly basis whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.  Factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, slower industry growth rates, or material changes with customers or contracts that could negatively impact future cash flows.  DTE Energy cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of such changes or any subsequent recovery.  If the carrying value of any goodwill is determined to be not recoverable, DTE Energy may take a non-cash impairment charge, which could materially impact DTE Energy's results of operations and financial position.The Registrants may not be fully covered by insurance.  The Registrants have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks, including catastrophic damage as a result of severe weather or other natural disasters, war, terrorism, cyber incidents, liability claims against the Registrants, or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact the Registrants' operations.  Economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance, or the Registrants' insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations.Safety and Security RisksThe Registrants' businesses have safety risks.  The Registrants' electric distribution system, power plants, renewable energy equipment, and other facilities, and DTE Energy's gas distribution system, gas infrastructure, and other facilities, could be involved in incidents that result in injury, death, or property loss to employees, customers, third parties, or the public.  Although the Registrants have insurance coverage for many potential incidents, depending upon the nature and severity of any incident, they could experience financial loss, damage to their reputation, and negative consequences from regulatory agencies or other public authorities.Threats of cyber incidents, physical security, and terrorism could affect the Registrants' business.  Issues may threaten the Registrants such as cyber incidents, physical security, or terrorism that may disrupt the Registrants' operations, and could harm the Registrants' operating results.Information security risks have increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks, and data security breaches.  The Registrants' industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information and control technology systems and network infrastructure.  All of the Registrants' technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyber incidents, physical security threats, acts of war or terrorism, and other causes, as well as loss of operational control of the Registrants' electric generation and distribution assets and, DTE Energy's gas distribution assets.  The Registrants have experienced, and expect to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents.  If the Registrants' information technology systems were to fail and they were unable to recover in a timely way, the Registrants may be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants' business, operating results, and financial condition.Suppliers, vendors, contractors, and information technology providers have access to systems that support the Registrants’ operations and maintain customer and employee data.  A breach of these third-party systems could adversely affect the business as if it was a breach of our own system.  Also, because the Registrants’ generation and distribution systems are part of an interconnected system, a disruption caused by a cyber incident at another utility, electric generator, system operator, or commodity supplier could also adversely affect the Registrants’ businesses, operating results, and financial condition.In addition, the Registrants' generation plants and electrical distribution facilities may be targets of physical security threats or terrorist activities that could disrupt the Registrants' ability to produce or distribute some portion of their products.  The Registrants have increased security as a result of past events and may be required by regulators or by the future threat environment to make investments in security that the Registrants cannot currently predict.Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect the Registrants.  In connection with the Registrants' businesses, they collect and retain personally identifiable information of their customers, shareholders, and employees.  Customers, shareholders, and employees expect that the Registrants will adequately protect their personal information.  The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding.  A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer, shareholder, employee, or Registrant data by cybercrime or otherwise, could adversely impact the Registrants' reputation, and could result in significant costs, fines, and litigation.23Table of ContentsGeneral and Other RisksFailure to attract and retain key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on the Registrants’ operations.  The Registrants' businesses are dependent on their ability to attract and retain skilled employees.  Competition for skilled employees in some areas is high, and the inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect the Registrants' business and future operating results.  In addition, the failure of a successful transfer of knowledge and expertise from any departing employees could negatively impact the Registrants' operations.DTE Energy relies on cash flows from subsidiaries.  DTE Energy is a holding company.  Cash flows from the utility and non-utility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on DTE Energy debt and securities.  Should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to DTE Energy, its ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted"

The Registrants are managing ongoing, and planning future, significant construction and capital improvement projects at the Registrants' multiple power generation and distribution facilities and at DTE Energy's gas distribution system.  Many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond the Registrants' control, including the cost of materials and labor, subcontractor performance, timing and issuance of necessary permits or approvals (including required certificates from regulatory agencies), construction disputes, impediments to acquiring rights-of-way or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms, cost overruns, and weather conditions.  Failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect the Registrants' financial performance, operations, or expected investment returns at the affected facilities, businesses and development projects.Operation of a nuclear facility subjects the Registrants to risk.  Ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects the Registrants to significant additional risks.  These risks include, among others, plant security, environmental regulation and remediation, changes in federal nuclear regulation, increased capital expenditures to meet industry requirements, and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility compared to other generation options.  Insurance maintained by the Registrants for various nuclear-related risks may not be sufficient to cover the Registrants' costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at the nuclear generating plant, which may affect the Registrants' financial performance.  In addition, the Registrants' nuclear decommissioning trust fund, to finance the decommissioning of the nuclear generating plant, may not be sufficient to fund the cost of decommissioning.  A decline in market value of assets held in decommissioning trust funds due to poor investment performance or other factors may increase the funding requirements for these obligations.  Any increase in funding requirements may have a material impact on the Registrants’ liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.20Table of ContentsThe supply and/or price of energy commodities and/or related services may impact the Registrants' financial results.  The Registrants are dependent on coal for much of their electrical generating capacity as well as uranium for their nuclear operations.  DTE Energy's access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for utility gas customers.  DTE Energy's non-utility businesses are also dependent upon supplies and prices of energy commodities and services.  Price fluctuations and changes in transportation costs, driven by inflation or other factors, as well as fuel supply disruptions, could have a negative impact on the amounts DTE Electric charges utility customers for electricity and DTE Gas charges utility customers for gas, and on the profitability of DTE Energy's non-utility businesses.  The Registrants' hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms may be insufficient to mitigate the negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices at their utility or DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, and the Registrants' financial performance may therefore be negatively impacted by price fluctuations.The price of energy also impacts the market for DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, particularly those that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers.  The price of environmental attributes generated by DTE Energy's renewable natural gas investments, including those related to the federal Renewable Fuel Standard and California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, may also impact the market and financial results for DTE Energy's non-utility businesses.The supply and/or price of other industrial raw and finished inputs and/or related services may impact the Registrants' financial results.  The Registrants are dependent on supplies of certain commodities, such as copper and limestone, among others, and industrial materials, and services in order to maintain day-to-day operations and maintenance of their facilities.  Price fluctuations, driven by inflation or other factors, or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items, could have a negative impact on the amounts charged to customers for the Registrants' utility products and, for DTE Energy, on the profitability of the non-utility businesses.Weather significantly affects operations.  As weather patterns exhibit increased deviations from historical trends, our utilities may experience financial and operational challenges.  Mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of the Registrants' assets, lowering income and cash flows.  At DTE Electric, high winds, floods, tornadoes, or ice storms can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities and require it to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses.  The expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process.  Prolonged and/or more frequent outages caused by increasingly extreme weather may result in decreased revenues and could also negatively impact DTE Energy's reputation and customer satisfaction or result in increased regulatory oversight.  Related damages to customer assets could subject DTE Energy to litigation.  DTE Gas can also experience higher than anticipated expenses from emergency repairs on its gas distribution infrastructure required as a result of weather-related issues.Unplanned power plant outages may be costly.  Unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations.  As a result of unforeseen maintenance, the Registrants may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed the costs of generation.  The Registrants' financial performance may be negatively affected if unable to recover such increased costs.A work interruption may adversely affect the Registrants.  There are several bargaining units for DTE Energy's approximately 5,050 and DTE Electric's approximately 2,600 represented employees.  The majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in 2027.  A union choosing to strike would have an impact on the Registrants' businesses.  The Registrants are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on their costs of operations and financial performance.21Table of ContentsDTE Energy may not achieve the carbon emissions goals of its electric and gas utilities.  DTE Energy has announced the voluntary commitments of its electric and gas utilities to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, along with intermediate emissions reduction goals at various points in the intervening years.  Technology research and developments, innovations, and advancements are critical to DTE Energy's ability to achieve these commitments, but they may not evolve as anticipated in order to provide cost-effective alternatives to traditional energy sources.  State and municipal restrictions on the siting of renewable energy assets could also impair efforts to meet our stated targets.  Additionally, we cannot guarantee that we will receive regulatory approval of our capital plans to transition to renewable energy and other new technologies.  Other factors that may impact DTE Energy's ability to achieve these emissions reduction goals include our service territory size and capacity needs remaining in line with current expectations, the impacts on our business of future regulations or legislation, the price and availability of carbon offsets, adoption of alternative energy products by the public such as greater use of electric vehicles, greater standardization of emissions reporting, and our ability over time to transition our electric generating portfolio.  DTE Energy's emissions reduction goals require making assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties.  Should one or more of these underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and ability to achieve our emissions reduction goals could differ materially from expectations.  In addition, DTE Energy cannot predict the ultimate impact of achieving these objectives, or the various implementation aspects on its reliability or its results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.  DTE Energy could suffer financial loss, reputational damage, litigation, or other negative repercussions if we are unable to meet our voluntary emissions reductions goals.Financial, Economic, and Market RisksDTE Energy's non-utility businesses may not perform to its expectations.  DTE Energy relies on non-utility businesses for a portion of earnings and will depend on the successful execution of new business development in its non-utilities to help achieve overall growth targets.  DTE Energy also expects to grow the non-utility businesses by developing or acquiring renewable energy and customer energy solutions projects over the long term; however, such opportunities may not materialize as anticipated.  If DTE Energy's current and contemplated non-utility investments do not perform at expected levels, DTE Energy could experience diminished earnings and a corresponding decline in shareholder value.Adverse changes in the Registrants' credit ratings may negatively affect them.  Regional and national economic conditions, increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes, as well as changes in the Registrants' economic performance, could result in credit agencies reexamining their credit ratings.  While credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance, a downgrade in the Registrants' credit ratings below investment grade could restrict or discontinue their ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in their borrowing costs, a reduced level of capital expenditures, and could impact future earnings and cash flows.  In addition, a reduction in the Registrants' credit ratings may require them to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energy-related commodities, products, and services, which could impact their liquidity.Poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact the Registrants' liquidity and results of operations.  The Registrants' costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation, and the Registrants' required or voluntary contributions made to the plans.  The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the Registrants' plans.  The Registrants have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations.  These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below the Registrants' projected return rates.  A decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding needs under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future.  Additionally, the pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  If interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding needs.  Also, if future increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from the Registrants' utility customers, the results of operations and financial position of the Registrants could be negatively affected.  Without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of plan assets, the Registrants could be required to fund these plans with significant amounts of cash.  Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on the Registrants' cash flows, financial position, or results of operations.22Table of ContentsThe Registrants' ability to access capital markets is important.  The Registrants' ability to access capital markets is important to operate their businesses and to fund capital investments.  Turmoil in credit markets may constrain the ability of Registrants and their subsidiaries to issue new debt, including commercial paper, and to refinance existing debt. Macroeconomic events may lead to higher interest rates on debt and could increase financing costs and adversely affect the Registrants' results of operations.  In addition, the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit the Registrants' access to capital markets.  The Registrants' long-term revolving credit facilities do not expire until 2027, but the Registrants regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects at the Registrants' utilities and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, and the Registrants cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions.Emerging technologies may have a material adverse effect on the Registrants.  Advances in technology that produce power or reduce power consumption include cost-effective renewable energy technologies, distributed generation, energy waste reduction technologies, and energy storage devices.  Such developments may impact the price of energy, may affect energy deliveries as customer-owned generation becomes more cost-effective, may require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands, and could make portions of our electric system power supply and/or distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives.  Such technologies could also result in further declines in commodity prices or demand for delivered energy.  Each of these factors could materially affect the Registrants’ results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.DTE Energy's participation in energy trading markets subjects it to risk.  Events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole.  In certain situations, DTE Energy may be required to post collateral to support trading operations, which could be substantial.  If access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed, DTE Energy could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows.  Energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose DTE Energy to risks related to commodity price movements, deviations in weather, and other related risks.  DTE Energy's trading business routinely has speculative trading positions in the market, within strict policy guidelines DTE Energy sets, resulting from the management of DTE Energy's business portfolio.  To the extent speculative trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish DTE Energy's financial results and financial position.  DTE Energy manages its exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures.  During periods of extreme volatility, these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities.Regional, national, and international economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on the Registrants.  The Registrants' utility and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers they serve and credit risk of counterparties they do business with.  Should the financial conditions of some of DTE Energy's significant customers deteriorate as a result of regional, national or international economic conditions, reduced volumes of electricity and gas, and demand for energy services DTE Energy supplies, collections of accounts receivable, reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding, and potentially higher levels of lost gas or stolen gas and electricity could result in decreased earnings and cash flows.If DTE Energy's goodwill becomes impaired, it may be required to record a charge to earnings.  DTE Energy annually reviews the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions it has made for impairment.  Goodwill is also reviewed on a quarterly basis whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.  Factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, slower industry growth rates, or material changes with customers or contracts that could negatively impact future cash flows.  DTE Energy cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of such changes or any subsequent recovery.  If the carrying value of any goodwill is determined to be not recoverable, DTE Energy may take a non-cash impairment charge, which could materially impact DTE Energy's results of operations and financial position.The Registrants may not be fully covered by insurance.  The Registrants have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks, including catastrophic damage as a result of severe weather or other natural disasters, war, terrorism, cyber incidents, liability claims against the Registrants, or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact the Registrants' operations.  Economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance, or the Registrants' insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations.23Table of ContentsSafety and Security RisksThe Registrants' businesses have safety risks.  The Registrants' electric distribution system, power plants, renewable energy equipment, and other facilities, and DTE Energy's gas distribution system, gas infrastructure, and other facilities, could be involved in incidents that result in injury, death, or property loss to employees, customers, third parties, or the public.  Although the Registrants have insurance coverage for many potential incidents, depending upon the nature and severity of any incident, they could experience financial loss, damage to their reputation, and negative consequences from regulatory agencies or other public authorities.Threats of cyber incidents, physical security, and terrorism could affect the Registrants' business.  Issues may threaten the Registrants such as cyber incidents, physical security, or terrorism that may disrupt the Registrants' operations, and could harm the Registrants' operating results.Information security risks have increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks, and data security breaches.  The Registrants' industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information and control technology systems and network infrastructure.  All of the Registrants' technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyber incidents, physical security threats, acts of war or terrorism, and other causes, as well as loss of operational control of the Registrants' electric generation and distribution assets and, DTE Energy's gas distribution assets.  The Registrants have experienced, and expect to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents.  If the Registrants' information technology systems were to fail and they were unable to recover in a timely way, the Registrants may be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants' business, operating results, and financial condition.Suppliers, vendors, contractors, and information technology providers have access to systems that support the Registrants’ operations and maintain customer and employee data.  A breach of these third-party systems could adversely affect the business as if it was a breach of our own system.  Also, because the Registrants’ generation and distribution systems are part of an interconnected system, a disruption caused by a cyber incident at another utility, electric generator, system operator, or commodity supplier could also adversely affect the Registrants’ businesses, operating results, and financial condition.In addition, the Registrants' generation plants and electrical distribution facilities may be targets of physical security threats or terrorist activities that could disrupt the Registrants' ability to produce or distribute some portion of their products.  The Registrants have increased security as a result of past events and may be required by regulators or by the future threat environment to make investments in security that the Registrants cannot currently predict.Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect the Registrants.  In connection with the Registrants' businesses, they collect and retain personally identifiable information of their customers, shareholders, and employees.  Customers, shareholders, and employees expect that the Registrants will adequately protect their personal information.  The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding.  A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer, shareholder, employee, or Registrant data by cybercrime or otherwise, could adversely impact the Registrants' reputation, and could result in significant costs, fines, and litigation.General and Other RisksFailure to attract and retain key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on the Registrants’ operations.  The Registrants' businesses are dependent on their ability to attract and retain skilled employees.  Competition for skilled employees in some areas is high, and the inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect the Registrants' business and future operating results.  In addition, the Registrants have an aging utility workforce, and the failure of a successful transfer of knowledge and expertise could negatively impact their operations.DTE Energy relies on cash flows from subsidiaries.  DTE Energy is a holding company.  Cash flows from the utility and non-utility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on DTE Energy debt and securities.  Should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to DTE Energy, its ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted.24Table of Contents"
5,DTE,DTE ENERGY CO,2022-02-10,"Risk Factors
There are various risks associated with the operations of the Registrants' utility businesses and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses.  To provide a framework to understand the operating environment of the Registrants, below is a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with their businesses.  Although the Registrants have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors, others could emerge in the future.  Each of the following risks could affect performance.Regulatory, Legislative, and Legal RisksThe Registrants are subject to rate regulation.  Electric and gas rates for the utilities are set by the MPSC and the FERC and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization.  The Registrants may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the MPSC, the FERC, or other regulatory bodies.  The Registrants' ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurring of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers' rates.  Regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers' rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under current governing laws and regulations.  Regulators may also disagree with the Registrants' rate calculations under the various mechanisms that are intended to mitigate the risk to their utilities related to certain aspects of the business.  If the Registrants cannot agree with regulators on an appropriate reconciliation of those mechanisms, it may impact the Registrants' ability to recover certain costs through customer rates.  Regulators may also decide to eliminate these mechanisms in future rate cases, which may make it more difficult for the Registrants to recover their costs in the rates charged to customers.  The Registrants cannot predict what rates the MPSC will authorize in future rate cases.  New legislation, regulations, or interpretations could change how the business operates, impact the Registrants' ability to recover costs through rates or the timing of such recovery, or require the Registrants to incur additional expenses.Changes to Michigan's electric retail access program could negatively impact the Registrants' financial performance.  The State of Michigan currently experiences a hybrid market, where the MPSC continues to regulate electric rates for DTE Electric customers, while alternative electric suppliers charge market-based rates.  MPSC rate orders, and energy legislation enacted by the State of Michigan, have placed a 10% cap on the total potential retail access migration.  However, even with the legislated 10% cap on participation, there continues to be legislative and financial risk associated with the electric retail access program.  Electric retail access migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes.  The Registrants are required under current regulation to provide full service to retail access customers that choose to return, potentially resulting in the need for additional generating capacity.Environmental laws and liability may be costly.  The Registrants are subject to, and affected by, numerous environmental regulations.  These regulations govern air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharge, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste.  Compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending, operating expenses, and plant down times, and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers.Uncertainty around future environmental regulations creates difficulty planning long-term capital projects in the Registrants' generation fleet and, for DTE Energy's gas distribution businesses.  These laws and regulations require the Registrants to seek a variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections, and other regulatory approvals.  The Registrants could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities, including the retirement of certain generating plants, based on these regulations.  Additionally, the Registrants may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body.  The Registrants cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs.  There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties.18The Registrants may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues.  Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce GHGs such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil fuels.  If increased regulations of GHG emissions are implemented, or if existing deadlines for these regulations are accelerated, the operations of DTE Electric's fossil-fueled generation assets may be significantly impacted.  Since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process, the Registrants' financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters.The Renewable Portfolio Standard and energy waste reduction may affect the Registrants' business and federal and state fuel standards may affect DTE Energy's non-utility investments.  The Registrants are subject to existing Michigan, and potential future, federal legislation and regulation requiring them to secure sources of renewable energy.  The Registrants have complied with the existing federal and state legislation, but do not know what requirements may be added by federal or state legislation in the future.  In addition, the Registrants expect to comply with new Michigan legislation increasing the percentage of power required to be provided by renewable energy sources.  The Registrants cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with complying with potential future legislation and regulations.  Compliance with these requirements can significantly increase capital expenditures and operating expenses and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers.In addition, the Registrants are also required by Michigan legislation to implement energy waste reduction measures and provide energy waste reduction customer awareness and education programs.  These requirements necessitate expenditures, and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing the Registrants' revenues as customers decrease their energy usage.  The Registrants cannot predict how these programs will impact their business and future operating results.DTE Energy's non-utility renewable natural gas investments are also dependent on the federal Renewable Fuel Standard and California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard.  Changes to these standards may affect DTE Energy's business and result in lower earnings.DTE Energy's ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited.  To reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil, the Internal Revenue Code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and electricity from alternative sources.  The Registrants generated production tax credits from renewable energy generation and DTE Energy generated production tax credits from renewable gas recovery, reduced emission fuel, and gas production operations.  If the Registrants' production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an IRS audit or changes in tax law, there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact the Registrants' earnings and cash flows.Operational RisksThe Registrants' electric distribution system and DTE Energy's gas distribution system are subject to risks from their operation, which could reduce revenues, increase expenses, and have a material adverse effect on their business, financial position, and results of operations.  The Registrants' electric distribution and DTE Energy’s gas distribution systems are subject to many operational risks.  These operational systems and infrastructure have been in service for many years.  Equipment, even when maintained in accordance with good utility practices, is subject to operational failure, including events that are beyond the Registrants' control, and could require significant operation and maintenance expense or capital expenditures to operate efficiently.  Because the Registrants’ distribution systems are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of the Registrants’ systems could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties.Construction and capital improvements to the Registrants' power facilities and DTE Energy's distribution systems subject them to risk.  The Registrants are managing ongoing, and planning future, significant construction and capital improvement projects at the Registrants' multiple power generation and distribution facilities and at DTE Energy's gas distribution system.  Many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond the Registrants' control, including the cost of materials and labor, subcontractor performance, timing and issuance of necessary permits or approvals (including required certificates from regulatory agencies), construction disputes, impediments to acquiring rights-of-way or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms, cost overruns, and weather conditions.  Failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect the Registrants' financial performance, operations, or expected investment returns at the affected facilities, businesses and development projects.19Operation of a nuclear facility subjects the Registrants to risk.  Ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects the Registrants to significant additional risks.  These risks include, among others, plant security, environmental regulation and remediation, changes in federal nuclear regulation, increased capital expenditures to meet industry requirements, and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility compared to other generation options.  Insurance maintained by the Registrants for various nuclear-related risks may not be sufficient to cover the Registrants' costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at the nuclear generating plant, which may affect the Registrants' financial performance.  In addition, the Registrants' nuclear decommissioning trust fund, to finance the decommissioning of the nuclear generating plant, may not be sufficient to fund the cost of decommissioning.  A decline in market value of assets held in decommissioning trust funds due to poor investment performance or other factors may increase the funding requirements for these obligations.  Any increase in funding requirements may have a material impact on the Registrants’ liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.The supply and/or price of energy commodities and/or related services may impact the Registrants' financial results.  The Registrants are dependent on coal for much of their electrical generating capacity as well as uranium for their nuclear operations.  DTE Energy's access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for utility gas customers.  DTE Energy's non-utility businesses are also dependent upon supplies and prices of energy commodities and services.  Price fluctuations, fuel supply disruptions, and changes in transportation costs, could have a negative impact on the amounts DTE Electric charges utility customers for electricity and DTE Gas charges utility customers for gas, and on the profitability of DTE Energy's non-utility businesses.  The Registrants' hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms may be insufficient to mitigate the negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices at their utility or DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, and the Registrants' financial performance may therefore be negatively impacted by price fluctuations.The price of energy also impacts the market for DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, particularly those that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers.  The price of environmental attributes generated by DTE Energy's renewable natural gas investments, including those related to the federal Renewable Fuel Standard and California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, may also impact the market and financial results for DTE Energy's non-utility businesses.The supply and/or price of other industrial raw and finished inputs and/or related services may impact the Registrants' financial results.  The Registrants are dependent on supplies of certain commodities, such as copper and limestone, among others, and industrial materials, and services in order to maintain day-to-day operations and maintenance of their facilities.  Price fluctuations, or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items, could have a negative impact on the amounts charged to customers for the Registrants' utility products and, for DTE Energy, on the profitability of the non-utility businesses.Weather, including extreme weather caused by climate change, significantly affects operations.  At both utilities, deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect the Registrants' earnings and cash flows.  Mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of the Registrants' assets, lowering income and cash flows.  At DTE Electric, ice storms, floods, tornadoes, or high winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities and require it to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses.  The expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process.  Prolonged and/or more frequent outages caused by extreme weather could also negatively impact DTE Energy's reputation and customer satisfaction or result in increased regulatory oversight, and related damages to customer assets could subject DTE Energy to litigation.  DTE Gas can also experience higher than anticipated expenses from emergency repairs on its gas distribution infrastructure required as a result of weather-related issues.Unplanned power plant outages may be costly.  Unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations.  As a result of unforeseen maintenance, the Registrants may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed the costs of generation.  The Registrants' financial performance may be negatively affected if unable to recover such increased costs.A work interruption may adversely affect the Registrants.  There are several bargaining units for DTE Energy's approximately 5,200 and DTE Electric's approximately 2,700 represented employees.  The majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in 2027.  A union choosing to strike would have an impact on the Registrants' businesses.  The Registrants are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on their costs of operations and financial performance.20DTE Energy may not achieve the net zero carbon emissions goals of its electric and gas utilities.  DTE Energy has announced the voluntary commitments of its electric and gas utilities to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.  Technology research and developments, innovations, and advancements are critical to DTE Energy's ability to achieve this commitment.  Other factors that may impact DTE Energy's ability to achieve these net zero goals include our service territory size and capacity needs remaining in line with current expectations, the impacts on our business of future regulations or legislation, the price and availability of carbon offsets, adoption of alternative energy products by the public such as greater use of electric vehicles, greater standardization of emissions reporting, and our ability over time to transition our electric generating portfolio.  DTE Energy's net zero goals require making assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties.  Should one or more of these underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and ability to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 could differ materially from expectations.  In addition, DTE Energy cannot predict the ultimate impact of achieving this objective, or the various implementation aspects on its reliability or its results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.Financial, Economic, and Market RisksDTE Energy's non-utility businesses may not perform to its expectations.  DTE Energy relies on non-utility businesses for a portion of earnings and will depend on the successful execution of new business development in its non-utilities to help achieve overall growth targets.  DTE Energy also expects that the loss of earnings from ceasing the operations of its REF non-utility business will be offset by growth in renewable energy and industrial services projects over the long term; however, such opportunities may not materialize as anticipated.  If DTE Energy's current and contemplated non-utility investments do not perform at expected levels, DTE Energy could experience diminished earnings and a corresponding decline in shareholder value.Adverse changes in the Registrants' credit ratings may negatively affect them.  Regional and national economic conditions, increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes, as well as changes in the Registrants' economic performance, could result in credit agencies reexamining their credit ratings.  While credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance, a downgrade in the Registrants' credit ratings below investment grade could restrict or discontinue their ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in their borrowing costs, a reduced level of capital expenditures, and could impact future earnings and cash flows.  In addition, a reduction in the Registrants' credit ratings may require them to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energy-related commodities, products, and services, which could impact their liquidity.Poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact the Registrants' liquidity and results of operations.  The Registrants' costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation, and the Registrants' required or voluntary contributions made to the plans.  The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the Registrants' plans.  The Registrants have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations.  These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below the Registrants' projected return rates.  A decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding needs under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future.  Additionally, the pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  If interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding needs.  Also, if future increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from the Registrants' utility customers, the results of operations and financial position of the Registrants could be negatively affected.  Without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of plan assets, the Registrants could be required to fund these plans with significant amounts of cash.  Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on the Registrants' cash flows, financial position, or results of operations.The Registrants' ability to access capital markets is important.  The Registrants' ability to access capital markets is important to operate their businesses and to fund capital investments.  Turmoil in credit markets may constrain the Registrants' ability, as well as the ability of their subsidiaries, to issue new debt, including commercial paper, and refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates.  In addition, the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit the Registrants' access to capital markets.  The Registrants' long-term revolving credit facilities do not expire until 2024 and 2025, but the Registrants regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects at the Registrants' utilities and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, and the Registrants cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions.21Emerging technologies may have a material adverse effect on the Registrants.  Advances in technology that produce power or reduce power consumption include cost-effective renewable energy technologies, distributed generation, energy waste reduction technologies, and energy storage devices.  Such developments may impact the price of energy, may affect energy deliveries as customer-owned generation becomes more cost-effective, may require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands, and could make portions of our electric system power supply and/or distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives.  Such technologies could also result in further declines in commodity prices or demand for delivered energy.  Each of these factors could materially affect the Registrants’ results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.DTE Energy's participation in energy trading markets subjects it to risk.  Events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole.  In certain situations, DTE Energy may be required to post collateral to support trading operations, which could be substantial.  If access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed, DTE Energy could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows.  Energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose DTE Energy to risks related to commodity price movements, deviations in weather, and other related risks.  DTE Energy's trading business routinely has speculative trading positions in the market, within strict policy guidelines DTE Energy sets, resulting from the management of DTE Energy's business portfolio.  To the extent speculative trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish DTE Energy's financial results and financial position.  DTE Energy manages its exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures.  During periods of extreme volatility, these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities.Regional, national, and international economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on the Registrants.  The Registrants' utility and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers they serve and credit risk of counterparties they do business with.  Should the financial conditions of some of DTE Energy's significant customers deteriorate as a result of regional, national or international economic conditions, reduced volumes of electricity and gas, and demand for energy services DTE Energy supplies, collections of accounts receivable, reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding, and potentially higher levels of lost gas or stolen gas and electricity could result in decreased earnings and cash flows.If DTE Energy's goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, it may be required to record a charge to earnings.  DTE Energy annually reviews the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions it has made for impairment.  Goodwill and other intangible assets are also reviewed on a quarterly basis whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.  Factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, slower industry growth rates, or material changes with customers or contracts that could negatively impact future cash flows.  DTE Energy cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of such changes or any subsequent recovery.  If the carrying value of any goodwill or other intangible assets are determined to be not recoverable, DTE Energy may take a non-cash impairment charge, which could materially impact DTE Energy's results of operations and financial position.The Registrants may not be fully covered by insurance.  The Registrants have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks, including catastrophic damage as a result of severe weather or other natural disasters, war, terrorism, cyber incidents, or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact the Registrants' operations.  Economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance, or the Registrants' insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations.Safety and Security RisksThe Registrants' businesses have safety risks.  The Registrants' electric distribution system, power plants, renewable energy equipment, and other facilities, and DTE Energy's gas distribution system, gas infrastructure, and other facilities, could be involved in incidents that result in injury, death, or property loss to employees, customers, third parties, or the public.  Although the Registrants have insurance coverage for many potential incidents, depending upon the nature and severity of any incident, they could experience financial loss, damage to their reputation, and negative consequences from regulatory agencies or other public authorities.Threats of cyber incidents, physical security, and terrorism could affect the Registrants' business.  Issues may threaten the Registrants such as cyber incidents, physical security, or terrorism that may disrupt the Registrants' operations, and could harm the Registrants' operating results.22Information security risks have increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks, and data security breaches.  The Registrants' industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information and control technology systems and network infrastructure.  All of the Registrants' technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyber incidents, physical security threats, acts of war or terrorism, and other causes, as well as loss of operational control of the Registrants' electric generation and distribution assets and, DTE Energy's gas distribution assets.  The Registrants have experienced, and expect to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents.  If the Registrants' information technology systems were to fail and they were unable to recover in a timely way, the Registrants may be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants' business, operating results, and financial condition.Suppliers, vendors, contractors, and information technology providers have access to systems that support the Registrants’ operations and maintain customer and employee data.  A breach of these third-party systems could adversely affect the business as if it was a breach of our own system.  Also, because the Registrants’ generation and distribution systems are part of an interconnected system, a disruption caused by a cyber incident at another utility, electric generator, system operator, or commodity supplier could also adversely affect the Registrants’ businesses, operating results, and financial condition.In addition, the Registrants' generation plants and electrical distribution facilities may be targets of physical security threats or terrorist activities that could disrupt the Registrants' ability to produce or distribute some portion of their products.  The Registrants have increased security as a result of past events and may be required by regulators or by the future threat environment to make investments in security that the Registrants cannot currently predict.Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect the Registrants.  In connection with the Registrants' businesses, they collect and retain personally identifiable information of their customers, shareholders, and employees.  Customers, shareholders, and employees expect that the Registrants will adequately protect their personal information.  The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding.  A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer, shareholder, employee, or Registrant data by cybercrime or otherwise, could adversely impact the Registrants' reputation, and could result in significant costs, fines, and litigation.General and Other RisksThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting impact on business and economic conditions could negatively affect the Registrants' businesses and operations.  The COVID-19 pandemic is currently impacting countries, communities, supply chains and markets.  The continued spread of COVID-19 and efforts to contain the virus, such as quarantines, closures, or reduced operations of businesses, governmental agencies and other institutions, have resulted in disruptions in various public, commercial, and industrial activities and have caused employee absences which interfered with certain operation and maintenance of the Registrants' facilities.  Travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, and shelter in place orders could also cause us to experience operational delays, delay the delivery of critical infrastructure and other supplies we source globally, or delay the connection of electric or gas service to new customers, and have reduced the use of electricity and gas by certain customers in the commercial and industrial segments.  Any of the foregoing circumstances could adversely affect customer demand or revenues, impact the ability of the Registrants' suppliers, vendors or contractors to perform, or cause other unpredictable events, which could adversely affect the Registrants' businesses, results of operations or financial condition.  The continued spread of COVID-19 has also led to disruption and volatility in the financial markets, which could increase the Registrants' costs to fund capital requirements and impact the operating results of our energy trading operations.  To the extent that the Registrants' access to the capital markets is adversely affected by COVID-19, the Registrants may need to consider alternative sources of funding for our operations and for working capital, any of which could increase the Registrants' cost of capital.  The extent to which COVID-19 may continue to impact the Registrants' liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information concerning the severity of COVID-19 and its related variants, vaccine distribution and public acceptance, and other actions taken to contain it or treat its impact, and the extent to which normal economic and operating conditions can resume, among others.  Our business continuity plans and insurance coverage may be insufficient to mitigate these adverse impacts to our business.Failure to attract and retain key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on the Registrants’ operations.  The Registrants' businesses are dependent on their ability to attract and retain skilled employees.  Competition for skilled employees in some areas is high, and the inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect the Registrants' business and future operating results.  In addition, the Registrants have an aging utility workforce, and the failure of a successful transfer of knowledge and expertise could negatively impact their operations.23DTE Energy relies on cash flows from subsidiaries.  DTE Energy is a holding company.  Cash flows from the utility and non-utility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on DTE Energy debt and securities.  Should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to DTE Energy, its ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted.The spin-off of DT Midstream (the ""Spin-off"") may not achieve its intended benefits and may present additional risk to DTE Energy.  As a result of the Spin-off, DTE Energy faces new and unique risks, including having fewer assets, reduced financial resources and less diversification of revenue sources.  The Spin-off may not achieve some or all of its anticipated benefits and we face risks providing DT Midstream with transition services.  Each of these factors may adversely impact DTE Energy's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.In connection with the Spin-off, DTE received a legal opinion that the distribution of shares of DT Midstream to DTE Energy shareholders qualifies as tax-free under Section 355 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.  However, if the IRS determined on audit that the distribution is taxable, both DTE Energy and our shareholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.Following the Spin-off, the management and directors of each of DTE Energy and DT Midstream own common stock in both companies, and Robert Skaggs, Jr., who is DT Midstream's Executive Chairman, also serves on DTE Energy's Board and may be required to recuse himself from deliberations relating to arrangements between DTE Energy and DT Midstream in the future.  This ownership and directorship overlap could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when the management and directors of one company face decisions that could have different implications for themselves and the other company.  Potential conflicts of interest may also arise out of commercial arrangements that DTE Energy and DT Midstream have or may enter into in the future"
6,DTE,DTE ENERGY CO,2021-02-19,"Risk Factors
There are various risks associated with the operations of the Registrants' utility businesses and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses.  To provide a framework to understand the operating environment of the Registrants, below is a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with their businesses.  Although the Registrants have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors, others could emerge in the future.  Each of the following risks could affect performance.Regulatory, Legislative, and Legal RisksThe Registrants are subject to rate regulation.  Electric and gas rates for the utilities are set by the MPSC and the FERC and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization.  The Registrants may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the MPSC, the FERC, or other regulatory bodies.  The Registrants' ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers' rates.  Regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers' rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under current governing laws and regulations.  Regulators may also disagree with the Registrants' rate calculations under the various mechanisms that are intended to mitigate the risk to their utilities related to certain aspects of the business.  If the Registrants cannot agree with regulators on an appropriate reconciliation of those mechanisms, it may impact the Registrants' ability to recover certain costs through customer rates.  Regulators may also decide to eliminate these mechanisms in future rate cases, which may make it more difficult for the Registrants to recover their costs in the rates charged to customers.  The Registrants cannot predict what rates the MPSC will authorize in future rate cases.  New legislation, regulations, or interpretations could change how the business operates, impact the Registrants' ability to recover costs through rates or the timing of such recovery, or require the Registrants to incur additional expenses.Changes to Michigan's electric retail access program could negatively impact the Registrants' financial performance.  The State of Michigan currently experiences a hybrid market, where the MPSC continues to regulate electric rates for DTE Electric customers, while alternative electric suppliers charge market-based rates.  MPSC rate orders, and energy legislation enacted by the State of Michigan, have placed a 10% cap on the total potential retail access migration.  However, even with the legislated 10% cap on participation, there continues to be legislative and financial risk associated with the electric retail access program.  Electric retail access migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes.  The Registrants are required under current regulation to provide full service to retail access customers that choose to return, potentially resulting in the need for additional generating capacity.Environmental laws and liability may be costly.  The Registrants are subject to, and affected by, numerous environmental regulations.  These regulations govern air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharge, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste.  Compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending, operating expenses, and plant down times, and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers.Uncertainty around future environmental regulations creates difficulty planning long-term capital projects in the Registrants' generation fleet and, for DTE Energy's gas distribution businesses.  These laws and regulations require the Registrants to seek a variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections, and other regulatory approvals.  The Registrants could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities, including the retirement of certain generating plants, based on these regulations.  Additionally, the Registrants may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body.  The Registrants cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs.  There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties.The Registrants may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues.  Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce GHGs such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil fuels.  If increased regulations of GHG emissions are implemented, the operations of DTE Electric's fossil-fueled generation assets may be significantly impacted.  Since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process, the Registrants' financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters.For DTE Energy, future environmental regulation of natural gas extraction techniques, including hydraulic fracturing, being discussed both at the United States federal level and by some states may affect the profitability of natural gas extraction businesses which could affect demand for, and profitability of, DTE Energy's gas transportation businesses.21The Renewable Portfolio Standard and energy waste reduction may affect the Registrants' business and federal and state fuel standards may affect DTE Energy's non-utility investments.  The Registrants are subject to existing Michigan, and potential future, federal legislation and regulation requiring them to secure sources of renewable energy.  The Registrants have complied with the existing federal and state legislation, but do not know what requirements may be added by federal or state legislation in the future.  In addition, the Registrants expect to comply with new Michigan legislation increasing the percentage of power required to be provided by renewable energy sources.  The Registrants cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with complying with potential future legislation and regulations.  Compliance with these requirements can significantly increase capital expenditures and operating expenses and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers.In addition, the Registrants are also required by Michigan legislation to implement energy waste reduction measures and provide energy waste reduction customer awareness and education programs.  These requirements necessitate expenditures, and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing the Registrants' revenues as customers decrease their energy usage.  The Registrants cannot predict how these programs will impact their business and future operating results.DTE Energy's non-utility renewable natural gas investments are also dependent on the federal Renewable Fuel Standard and California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard.  Changes to these standards may affect DTE Energy's business and result in lower earnings.DTE Energy's ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited.  To reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil, the Internal Revenue Code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and electricity from alternative sources.  The Registrants generated production tax credits from renewable energy generation and DTE Energy generated production tax credits from renewable gas recovery, reduced emission fuel, and gas production operations.  If the Registrants' production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an IRS audit or changes in tax law, there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact the Registrants' earnings and cash flows.Operational RisksThe Registrants' electric distribution system and DTE Energy's gas distribution system are subject to risks from their operation, which could reduce revenues, increase expenses, and have a material adverse effect on their business, financial position, and results of operations.  The Registrants' electric distribution and DTE Energy’s gas distribution systems are subject to many operational risks.  These operational systems and infrastructure have been in service for many years.  Equipment, even when maintained in accordance with good utility practices, is subject to operational failure, including events that are beyond the Registrants' control, and could require significant operation and maintenance expense or capital expenditures to operate efficiently.  Because the Registrants’ distribution systems are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of the Registrants’ systems could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties.Construction and capital improvements to the Registrants' power facilities, DTE Energy's distribution systems and its Gas Storage and Pipelines business subject them to risk.  The Registrants are managing ongoing, and planning future, significant construction and capital improvement projects at the Registrants' multiple power generation and distribution facilities, at DTE Energy's gas distribution system, and at DTE Energy's Gas Storage and Pipelines business.  Many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond the Registrants' control, including the cost of materials and labor, subcontractor performance, timing and issuance of necessary permits or approvals (including required certificates from regulatory agencies), construction disputes, impediments to acquiring rights-of-way or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms, cost overruns, and weather conditions.  Failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect the Registrants' financial performance, operations, or expected investment returns at the affected facilities, businesses and development projects.22Operation of a nuclear facility subjects the Registrants to risk.  Ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects the Registrants to significant additional risks.  These risks include, among others, plant security, environmental regulation and remediation, changes in federal nuclear regulation, increased capital expenditures to meet industry requirements, and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility compared to other generation options.  Insurance maintained by the Registrants for various nuclear-related risks may not be sufficient to cover the Registrants' costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at the nuclear generating plant, which may affect the Registrants' financial performance.  In addition, the Registrants' nuclear decommissioning trust fund, to finance the decommissioning of the nuclear generating plant, may not be sufficient to fund the cost of decommissioning.  A decline in market value of assets held in decommissioning trust funds due to poor investment performance or other factors may increase the funding requirements for these obligations.  Any increase in funding requirements may have a material impact on the Registrants’ liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.The supply and/or price of energy commodities and/or related services may impact the Registrants' financial results.  The Registrants are dependent on coal for much of their electrical generating capacity as well as uranium for their nuclear operations.  DTE Energy's access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for utility gas customers.  DTE Energy's non-utility businesses are also dependent upon supplies and prices of energy commodities and services.  Price fluctuations, fuel supply disruptions, and changes in transportation costs, could have a negative impact on the amounts DTE Electric charges utility customers for electricity and DTE Gas charges utility customers for gas, and on the profitability of DTE Energy's non-utility businesses.  The Registrants' hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms may be insufficient to mitigate the negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices at their utility or DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, and the Registrants' financial performance may therefore be negatively impacted by price fluctuations.  The price of energy also impacts the market for DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, particularly those that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers as well as midstream services that depend on the demand for natural gas.The supply and/or price of other industrial raw and finished inputs and/or related services may impact the Registrants' financial results.  The Registrants are dependent on supplies of certain commodities, such as copper and limestone, among others, and industrial materials, and services in order to maintain day-to-day operations and maintenance of their facilities.  Price fluctuations, or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items, could have a negative impact on the amounts charged to customers for the Registrants' utility products and, for DTE Energy, on the profitability of the non-utility businesses.Weather significantly affects operations.  At both utilities, deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect the Registrants' earnings and cash flows.  Mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of the Registrants' assets, lowering income and cash flows.  At DTE Electric, ice storms, tornadoes, or high winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities and require it to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses.  The expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process.  DTE Gas can experience higher than anticipated expenses from emergency repairs on its gas distribution infrastructure required as a result of weather-related issues.Unplanned power plant outages may be costly.  Unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations.  As a result of unforeseen maintenance, the Registrants may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed the costs of generation.  The Registrants' financial performance may be negatively affected if unable to recover such increased costs.A work interruption may adversely affect the Registrants.  There are several bargaining units for DTE Energy's approximately 5,200 and DTE Electric's approximately 2,800 represented employees.  The majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in 2021 and 2022.  A union choosing to strike would have an impact on the Registrants' businesses.  The Registrants are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on their costs of operations and financial performance.Financial, Economic, and Market RisksDTE Energy's non-utility businesses may not perform to its expectations.  DTE Energy relies on non-utility operations for a significant portion of earnings.  If DTE Energy's current and contemplated non-utility investments do not perform at expected levels, DTE Energy could experience diminished earnings and a corresponding decline in shareholder value.23Adverse changes in the Registrants' credit ratings may negatively affect them.  Regional and national economic conditions, increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes, as well as changes in the Registrants' economic performance, could result in credit agencies reexamining their credit ratings.  While credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance, a downgrade in the Registrants' credit ratings below investment grade could restrict or discontinue their ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in their borrowing costs, a reduced level of capital expenditures, and could impact future earnings and cash flows.  In addition, a reduction in the Registrants' credit ratings may require them to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energy-related commodities, products, and services, which could impact their liquidity.Poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact the Registrants' liquidity and results of operations.  The Registrants' costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation, and the Registrants' required or voluntary contributions made to the plans.  The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the Registrants' plans.  The Registrants have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations.  These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below the Registrants' projected return rates.  A decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding needs under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future.  Additionally, the pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  If interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding needs.  Also, if future increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from the Registrants' utility customers, the results of operations and financial position of the Registrants could be negatively affected.  Without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of plan assets, the Registrants could be required to fund these plans with significant amounts of cash.  Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on the Registrants' cash flows, financial position, or results of operations.The Registrants' ability to access capital markets is important.  The Registrants' ability to access capital markets is important to operate their businesses and to fund capital investments.  Turmoil in credit markets may constrain the Registrants' ability, as well as the ability of their subsidiaries, to issue new debt, including commercial paper, and refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates.  In addition, the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit the Registrants' access to capital markets.  The Registrants' long-term revolving credit facilities do not expire until 2024, but the Registrants regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects at the Registrants' utilities and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, and the Registrants cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions.Emerging technologies may have a material adverse effect on the Registrants.  Advances in technology that produce power or reduce power consumption include cost-effective renewable energy technologies, distributed generation, energy waste reduction technologies, and energy storage devices.  Such developments may impact the price of energy, may affect energy deliveries as customer-owned generation becomes more cost-effective, may require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands, and could make portions of our electric system power supply and/or distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives.  Such technologies could also result in further declines in commodity prices or demand for delivered energy.  Each of these factors could materially affect the Registrants’ results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.DTE Energy's participation in energy trading markets subjects it to risk.  Events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole.  In certain situations, DTE Energy may be required to post collateral to support trading operations, which could be substantial.  If access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed, DTE Energy could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows.  Energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose DTE Energy to risks related to commodity price movements, deviations in weather, and other related risks.  DTE Energy's trading business routinely has speculative trading positions in the market, within strict policy guidelines DTE Energy sets, resulting from the management of DTE Energy's business portfolio.  To the extent speculative trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish DTE Energy's financial results and financial position.  DTE Energy manages its exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures.  During periods of extreme volatility, these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities.24Regional, national, and international economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on the Registrants.  The Registrants' utility and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers they serve and credit risk of counterparties they do business with.  Should the financial conditions of some of DTE Energy's significant customers deteriorate as a result of regional, national or international economic conditions, reduced volumes of electricity and gas, and demand for energy services DTE Energy supplies, collections of accounts receivable, reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding, and potentially higher levels of lost gas or stolen gas and electricity could result in decreased earnings and cash flows.If DTE Energy's goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, it may be required to record a charge to earnings.  DTE Energy annually reviews the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions it has made for impairment.  Goodwill and other intangible assets are also reviewed on a quarterly basis whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.  Factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, slower industry growth rates, or material changes with customers or contracts that could negatively impact future cash flows.  DTE Energy cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of such changes or any subsequent recovery.  If the carrying value of any goodwill or other intangible assets are determined to be not recoverable, DTE Energy may take a non-cash impairment charge, which could materially impact DTE Energy's results of operations and financial position.The Registrants may not be fully covered by insurance.  The Registrants have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks, including catastrophic damage as a result of severe weather or other natural disasters, war, terrorism, cyber incidents, or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact the Registrants' operations.  Economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance, or the Registrants' insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations.Safety and Security RisksThe Registrants' businesses have safety risks.  The Registrants' electric distribution system, power plants, renewable energy equipment, and other facilities, and DTE Energy's gas distribution system, gas infrastructure, and other facilities, could be involved in incidents that result in injury, death, or property loss to employees, customers, third parties, or the public.  Although the Registrants have insurance coverage for many potential incidents, depending upon the nature and severity of any incident, they could experience financial loss, damage to their reputation, and negative consequences from regulatory agencies or other public authorities.Threats of cyber incidents, physical security, and terrorism could affect the Registrants' business.  Issues may threaten the Registrants such as cyber incidents, physical security, or terrorism that may disrupt the Registrants' operations, and could harm the Registrants' operating results.Information security risks have increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks, and data security breaches.  The Registrants' industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information and control technology systems and network infrastructure.  All of the Registrants' technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyber incidents, physical security threats, acts of war or terrorism, and other causes, as well as loss of operational control of the Registrants' electric generation and distribution assets and, DTE Energy's gas distribution assets.  If the Registrants' information technology systems were to fail and they were unable to recover in a timely way, the Registrants may be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants' business, operating results, and financial condition.Suppliers, vendors, contractors, and information technology providers have access to systems that support the Registrants’ operations and maintain customer and employee data.  A breach of these third-party systems could adversely affect the business as if it was a breach of our own system.  Also, because the Registrants’ generation and distribution systems are part of an interconnected system, a disruption caused by a cyber incident at another utility, electric generator, system operator, or commodity supplier could also adversely affect the Registrants’ businesses, operating results, and financial condition.In addition, the Registrants' generation plants and electrical distribution facilities, and DTE Energy's gas pipeline and storage facilities in particular, may be targets of physical security threats or terrorist activities that could disrupt the Registrants' ability to produce or distribute some portion of their products.  The Registrants have increased security as a result of past events and may be required by regulators or by the future threat environment to make investments in security that the Registrants cannot currently predict.25Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect the Registrants.  In connection with the Registrants' businesses, they collect and retain personally identifiable information of their customers, shareholders, and employees.  Customers, shareholders, and employees expect that the Registrants will adequately protect their personal information.  The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding.  A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer, shareholder, employee, or Registrant data by cybercrime or otherwise, could adversely impact the Registrants' reputation, and could result in significant costs, fines, and litigation.General and Other RisksThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting impact on business and economic conditions could negatively affect theRegistrants' businesses and operations.  The COVID-19 pandemic is currently impacting countries, communities, supply chainsand markets.  The continued spread of COVID-19 and efforts to contain the virus, such as quarantines, closures, or reducedoperations of businesses, governmental agencies and other institutions, have caused a recession, resulting in disruptions in various public, commercial, and industrial activities and have caused employee absences which interfered with certain operation and maintenance of the Registrants' facilities.  Travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, and shelter in place orders could also cause us to experience operational delays, delay the delivery of critical infrastructure and other supplies we source globally, or delay the connection of electric or gas service to new customers, and have reduced the use of electricity and gas by certain customers in the commercial and industrial segments.  Certain of our businesses have experienced lower sales volumes, and any of the foregoing circumstances could further adversely affect customer demand or revenues, impact the ability of the Registrants' suppliers, vendors or contractors to perform, or cause other unpredictable events, which could adversely affect the Registrants' businesses, results of operations or financial condition.  The continued spread of COVID-19 has also led to disruption and volatility in the financial markets, which could increase the Registrants' costs to fund capital requirements and impact the operating results of our energy trading operations.  To the extent that the Registrants' access to the capital markets is adversely affected by COVID-19, the Registrants may need to consider alternative sources of funding for our operations and for working capital, any of which could increase the Registrants' cost of capital.  The extent to which COVID-19 may impact the Registrants' liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information concerning the severity of COVID-19 and related variants, vaccine distribution and other actions taken to contain it or treat its impact, and the extent to which normal economic and operating conditions can resume, among others.  Our business continuity plans and insurance coverage may be insufficient to mitigate these adverse impacts to our business.  In addition, the Registrants’ may be required to suspend shut offs for certain customers which may adversely impact the Registrants’ collections process and have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.Failure to attract and retain key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on the Registrants’ operations.  The Registrants' businesses are dependent on their ability to attract and retain skilled employees.  Competition for skilled employees in some areas is high, and the inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect the Registrants' business and future operating results.  In addition, the Registrants have an aging utility workforce, and the failure of a successful transfer of knowledge and expertise could negatively impact their operations.DTE Energy relies on cash flows from subsidiaries.  DTE Energy is a holding company.  Cash flows from the utility and non-utility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on DTE Energy debt and securities.  Should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to DTE Energy, its ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted.26The proposed spin-off of DTE Midstream (the ""Proposed Spin-off"") may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or terms, or at all, and may not achieve the intended benefits.  The Proposed Spin-off, if completed, may also present additional risk to DTE Energy.  The Proposed Spin-off is subject to conditions, including, without limitation, final DTE Energy Board of Directors approval.  Unanticipated developments or changes in market conditions may delay the Proposed Spin-off, and the Proposed Spin-off may not occur on the currently contemplated timeline or at all.  DTE Energy cannot predict with certainty when the benefits expected from the Proposed Spin-off will occur or the extent to which they will be achieved, if at all.  Furthermore, there are various uncertainties and risks relating to the process of the Proposed Spin-off that could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, including disruption of our operations and impairment of our relationship with regulators, key personnel, customers, and vendors.  If the Proposed Spin-off is successfully completed, DTE Energy will face new and unique risks, including having fewer assets, reduced financial resources and less diversification of revenue sources, which may adversely impact DTE Energy's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  In addition, the changes in our operational and financial profile may not meet some or all of our shareholders' investment strategies, which could cause investors to sell their DTE Energy shares and otherwise decrease demand for shares of DTE Energy common stock.  Excess selling will cause the relative market price of DTE Energy common stock to decrease, and the market price of DTE Energy common stock may be subject to greater volatility following the completion of the Proposed Spin-off.While DTE Energy does not expect its credit ratings from Standard & Poor's Rating Service, Moody's Investor Service, and Fitch Ratings Inc. to drop below investment grade as a result of completing the Proposed Spin-off, there is no assurance that we will continue to maintain such investment grade credit ratings in the future.  If a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade, our borrowing costs would increase and our funding sources could decrease.  In addition, a failure by us to maintain an investment grade rating could affect our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners.The distribution of shares of the new midstream company (""DT Midstream"") to DTE Energy shareholders in the Proposed Spin-off is expected to qualify as tax-free under Section 355 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.  However, if the IRS determined on audit that the distribution is taxable, both DTE Energy and our shareholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.Following the Proposed Spin-off, the management and directors each of DTE Energy and DT Midstream may own common stock in both companies and Robert Skaggs, Jr., who will be a member of DT Midstream's Board, also serves on DTE Energy's Board and may be required to recuse himself from deliberations relating to arrangements between DTE Energy and DT Midstream in the future.  This ownership and directorship overlap could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when the management and directors of one company face decisions that could have different implications for themselves and the other company.  Potential conflicts of interest may also arise out of any commercial arrangements that DTE Energy and DT Midstream may enter into in the future"
7,DTE,DTE ENERGY CO,2020-02-05,"Risk Factors
There are various risks associated with the operations of the Registrants' utility businesses and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses.  To provide a framework to understand the operating environment of the Registrants, below is a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with their businesses.  Although the Registrants have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors, others could emerge in the future.  Each of the following risks could affect performance.The Registrants are subject to rate regulation.  Electric and gas rates for the utilities are set by the MPSC and the FERC and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization.  The Registrants may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the MPSC, the FERC, or other regulatory bodies.  The Registrants' ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers' rates.  Regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers' rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under current governing laws and regulations.  Regulators may also disagree with the Registrants' rate calculations under the various mechanisms that are intended to mitigate the risk to their utilities related to certain aspects of the business.  If the Registrants cannot agree with regulators on an appropriate reconciliation of those mechanisms, it may impact the Registrants' ability to recover certain costs through customer rates.  Regulators may also decide to eliminate these mechanisms in future rate cases, which may make it more difficult for the Registrants to recover their costs in the rates charged to customers.  The Registrants cannot predict what rates the MPSC will authorize in future rate cases.  New legislation, regulations, or interpretations could change how the business operates, impact the Registrants' ability to recover costs through rates or the timing of such recovery, or require the Registrants to incur additional expenses.Changes to Michigan's electric retail access program could negatively impact the Registrants' financial performance.  The State of Michigan currently experiences a hybrid market, where the MPSC continues to regulate electric rates for DTE Electric customers, while alternative electric suppliers charge market-based rates.  MPSC rate orders, and energy legislation enacted by the State of Michigan, have placed a 10% cap on the total potential retail access migration.  However, even with the legislated 10% cap on participation, there continues to be legislative and financial risk associated with the electric retail access program.  Electric retail access migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes.  The Registrants are required under current regulation to provide full service to retail access customers that choose to return, potentially resulting in the need for additional generating capacity.The Registrants' electric distribution system and DTE Energy's gas distribution system are subject to risks from their operation, which could reduce revenues, increase expenses, and have a material adverse effect on their business, financial position, and results of operations.  The Registrants' electric distribution and DTE Energy’s gas distribution systems are subject to many operational risks.  These operational systems and infrastructure have been in service for many years.  Equipment, even when maintained in accordance with good utility practices, is subject to operational failure, including events that are beyond the Registrants' control, and could require significant operation and maintenance expense or capital expenditures to operate efficiently.  Because the Registrants’ distribution systems are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of the Registrants’ systems could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties.DTE Energy's non-utility businesses may not perform to its expectations.  DTE Energy relies on non-utility operations for an increasing portion of earnings.  If DTE Energy's current and contemplated non-utility investments, including the acquisition of midstream natural gas assets in December 2019, do not perform at expected levels, DTE Energy could experience diminished earnings and a corresponding decline in shareholder value. 20DTE Energy relies on cash flows from subsidiaries.  DTE Energy is a holding company.  Cash flows from the utility and non-utility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on DTE Energy debt and securities.  Should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to DTE Energy, its ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted.The Registrants' businesses have safety risks.  The Registrants' electric distribution system, power plants, renewable energy equipment, and other facilities, and DTE Energy's gas distribution system, gas infrastructure, and other facilities, could be involved in incidents that result in injury, death, or property loss to employees, customers, third parties, or the public.  Although the Registrants have insurance coverage for many potential incidents, depending upon the nature and severity of any incident, they could experience financial loss, damage to their reputation, and negative consequences from regulatory agencies or other public authorities.Environmental laws and liability may be costly.  The Registrants are subject to, and affected by, numerous environmental regulations.  These regulations govern air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharge, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste.  Compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending, operating expenses, and plant down times, and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers.Uncertainty around future environmental regulations creates difficulty planning long-term capital projects in the Registrants' generation fleet and, for DTE Energy's gas distribution businesses.  These laws and regulations require the Registrants to seek a variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections, and other regulatory approvals.  The Registrants could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities, including the retirement of certain generating plants, based on these regulations.  Additionally, the Registrants may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body.  The Registrants cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs.  There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties.The Registrants may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues.  Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce GHGs such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil fuels.  If increased regulations of GHG emissions are implemented, the operations of DTE Electric's fossil-fueled generation assets may be significantly impacted.  Since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process, the Registrants' financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters.For DTE Energy, future environmental regulation of natural gas extraction techniques, including hydraulic fracturing, being discussed both at the United States federal level and by some states may affect the profitability of natural gas extraction businesses which could affect demand for, and profitability of, DTE Energy's gas transportation businesses.Threats of cyber incidents, physical security, and terrorism could affect the Registrants' business.  Issues may threaten the Registrants such as cyber incidents, physical security, or terrorism that may disrupt the Registrants' operations, and could harm the Registrants' operating results.Information security risks have increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks, and data security breaches.  The Registrants' industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information and control technology systems and network infrastructure.  All of the Registrants' technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyber incidents, physical security threats, acts of war or terrorism, and other causes, as well as loss of operational control of the Registrants' electric generation and distribution assets and, DTE Energy's gas distribution assets.  If the Registrants' information technology systems were to fail and they were unable to recover in a timely way, the Registrants may be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants' business, operating results, and financial condition.Suppliers, vendors, contractors, and information technology providers have access to systems that support the Registrants’ operations and maintain customer and employee data.  A breach of these third-party systems could adversely affect the business as if it was a breach of our own system.  Also, because the Registrants’ generation and distribution systems are part of an interconnected system, a disruption caused by a cyber incident at another utility, electric generator, system operator, or commodity supplier could also adversely affect the Registrants’ businesses, operating results, and financial condition. 21In addition, the Registrants' generation plants and electrical distribution facilities, and DTE Energy's gas pipeline and storage facilities in particular, may be targets of physical security threats or terrorist activities that could disrupt the Registrants' ability to produce or distribute some portion of their products.  The Registrants have increased security as a result of past events and may be required by regulators or by the future threat environment to make investments in security that the Registrants cannot currently predict.Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect the Registrants.  In connection with the Registrants' businesses, they collect and retain personally identifiable information of their customers, shareholders, and employees.  Customers, shareholders, and employees expect that the Registrants will adequately protect their personal information.  The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding.  A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer, shareholder, employee, or Registrant data by cybercrime or otherwise, could adversely impact the Registrants' reputation, and could result in significant costs, fines, and litigation.Construction and capital improvements to the Registrants' power facilities, DTE Energy's distribution systems and its Gas Storage and Pipelines business subject them to risk.  The Registrants are managing ongoing, and planning future, significant construction and capital improvement projects at the Registrants' multiple power generation and distribution facilities, at DTE Energy's gas distribution system, and at DTE Energy's Gas Storage and Pipelines business.  Many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond the Registrants' control, including the cost of materials and labor, subcontractor performance, timing and issuance of necessary permits or approvals (including required certificates from regulatory agencies), construction disputes, impediments to acquiring rights-of-way or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms, cost overruns, and weather conditions.  Failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect the Registrants' financial performance, operations, or expected investment returns at the affected facilities, businesses and development projects.Operation of a nuclear facility subjects the Registrants to risk.  Ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects the Registrants to significant additional risks.  These risks include, among others, plant security, environmental regulation and remediation, changes in federal nuclear regulation, increased capital expenditures to meet industry requirements, and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility compared to other generation options.  A specific example of increased capital expenditures to meet industry requirements is DTE Electric having an open Confirmatory Action Letter with the NRC to complete specific mitigation actions during the next periodic outage in 2020 and that DTE Electric will not bring the plant back on line until it is completed.  Insurance maintained by the Registrants for various nuclear-related risks may not be sufficient to cover the Registrants' costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at the nuclear generating plant, which may affect the Registrants' financial performance.  In addition, the Registrants' nuclear decommissioning trust fund, to finance the decommissioning of the nuclear generating plant, may not be sufficient to fund the cost of decommissioning.  A decline in market value of assets held in decommissioning trust funds due to poor investment performance or other factors may increase the funding requirements for these obligations.  Any increase in funding requirements may have a material impact on the Registrants’ liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.The supply and/or price of energy commodities and/or related services may impact the Registrants' financial results.  The Registrants are dependent on coal for much of their electrical generating capacity as well as uranium for their nuclear operations.  DTE Energy's access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for utility gas customers.  DTE Energy's non-utility businesses are also dependent upon supplies and prices of energy commodities and services.  Price fluctuations, fuel supply disruptions, and changes in transportation costs, could have a negative impact on the amounts DTE Electric charges utility customers for electricity and DTE Gas charges utility customers for gas, and on the profitability of DTE Energy's non-utility businesses.  The Registrants' hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms may be insufficient to mitigate the negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices at their utility or DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, and the Registrants' financial performance may therefore be negatively impacted by price fluctuations.  The price of energy also impacts the market for DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, particularly those that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers as well as midstream services that depend on the demand for natural gas.The supply and/or price of other industrial raw and finished inputs and/or related services may impact the Registrants' financial results.  The Registrants are dependent on supplies of certain commodities, such as copper and limestone, among others, and industrial materials, and services in order to maintain day-to-day operations and maintenance of their facilities.  Price fluctuations, or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items, could have a negative impact on the amounts charged to customers for the Registrants' utility products and, for DTE Energy, on the profitability of the non-utility businesses. 22Emerging technologies may have a material adverse effect on the Registrants.  Advances in technology that produce power or reduce power consumption include cost-effective renewable energy technologies, distributed generation, energy waste reduction technologies, and energy storage devices.  Such developments may impact the price of energy, may affect energy deliveries as customer-owned generation becomes more cost-effective, may require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands, and could make portions of our electric system power supply and/or distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives.  Such technologies could also result in further declines in commodity prices or demand for delivered energy.  Each of these factors could materially affect the Registrants’ results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.Adverse changes in the Registrants' credit ratings may negatively affect them.  Regional and national economic conditions, increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes, as well as changes in the Registrants' economic performance, could result in credit agencies reexamining their credit ratings.  While credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance, a downgrade in the Registrants' credit ratings below investment grade could restrict or discontinue their ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in their borrowing costs, a reduced level of capital expenditures, and could impact future earnings and cash flows.  In addition, a reduction in the Registrants' credit ratings may require them to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energy-related commodities, products, and services, which could impact their liquidity.Poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact the Registrants' liquidity and results of operations.  The Registrants' costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation, and the Registrants' required or voluntary contributions made to the plans.  The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the Registrants' plans.  The Registrants have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations.  These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below the Registrants' projected return rates.  A decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future.  Additionally, the pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  If interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding requirements.  Also, if future increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from the Registrants' utility customers, the results of operations and financial position of the Registrants could be negatively affected.  Without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of plan assets, the Registrants could be required to fund these plans with significant amounts of cash.  Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on the Registrants' cash flows, financial position, or results of operations.The Registrants' ability to access capital markets is important.  The Registrants' ability to access capital markets is important to operate their businesses and to fund capital investments.  Turmoil in credit markets may constrain the Registrants' ability, as well as the ability of their subsidiaries, to issue new debt, including commercial paper, and refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates.  In addition, the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit the Registrants' access to capital markets.  The Registrants' long-term revolving credit facilities do not expire until 2024, but the Registrants regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects at the Registrants' utilities and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, and the Registrants cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions.DTE Energy's participation in energy trading markets subjects it to risk.  Events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole.  In certain situations, DTE Energy may be required to post collateral to support trading operations, which could be substantial.  If access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed, DTE Energy could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows.  Energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose DTE Energy to risks related to commodity price movements, deviations in weather, and other related risks.  DTE Energy's trading business routinely has speculative trading positions in the market, within strict policy guidelines DTE Energy sets, resulting from the management of DTE Energy's business portfolio.  To the extent speculative trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish DTE Energy's financial results and financial position.  DTE Energy manages its exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures.  During periods of extreme volatility, these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities. 23Weather significantly affects operations.  At both utilities, deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect the Registrants' earnings and cash flows.  Mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of the Registrants' assets, lowering income and cash flows.  At DTE Electric, ice storms, tornadoes, or high winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities and require it to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses.  The expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process.  DTE Gas can experience higher than anticipated expenses from emergency repairs on its gas distribution infrastructure required as a result of weather related issues.Unplanned power plant outages may be costly.  Unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations.  As a result of unforeseen maintenance, the Registrants may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed the costs of generation.  The Registrants' financial performance may be negatively affected if unable to recover such increased costs.Regional, national, and international economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on the Registrants.  The Registrants' utility and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers they serve and credit risk of counterparties they do business with.  Should the financial conditions of some of DTE Energy's significant customers deteriorate as a result of regional, national or international economic conditions, reduced volumes of electricity and gas, and demand for energy services DTE Energy supplies, collections of accounts receivable, reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding, and potentially higher levels of lost gas or stolen gas and electricity could result in decreased earnings and cash flows.Renewable portfolio standards and energy waste reduction may affect the Registrants' business and federal and state fuel standards may affect DTE Energy's non-utility investments.  The Registrants are subject to existing Michigan, and potential future, federal legislation and regulation requiring them to secure sources of renewable energy.  The Registrants have complied with the existing federal and state legislation, but do not know what requirements may be added by federal or state legislation in the future.  In addition, the Registrants expect to comply with new Michigan legislation increasing the percentage of power required to be provided by renewable energy sources.  The Registrants cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with complying with potential future legislation and regulations.  Compliance with these requirements can significantly increase capital expenditures and operating expenses and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers.In addition, the Registrants are also required by Michigan legislation to implement energy waste reduction measures and provide energy waste reduction customer awareness and education programs.  These requirements necessitate expenditures, and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing the Registrants' revenues as customers decrease their energy usage.  The Registrants cannot predict how these programs will impact their business and future operating results.DTE Energy's non-utility renewable natural gas investments are also dependent on the federal Renewable Fuel Standard and California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard.  Changes to these standards may affect DTE Energy's business and result in lower earnings.Failure to attract and retain key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on the Registrants’ operations.  The Registrants' businesses are dependent on their ability to attract and retain skilled employees.  Competition for skilled employees in some areas is high, and the inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect the Registrants' business and future operating results.  In addition, the Registrants have an aging utility workforce, and the failure of a successful transfer of knowledge and expertise could negatively impact their operations.A work interruption may adversely affect the Registrants.  There are several bargaining units for DTE Energy's approximately 5,300 and DTE Electric's approximately 2,800 represented employees.  The majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in 2021 and 2022.  A union choosing to strike would have an impact on the Registrants' businesses.  The Registrants are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on their costs of operations and financial performance. 24DTE Energy's ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited.  To reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil, the Internal Revenue Code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and electricity from alternative sources.  The Registrants generated production tax credits from renewable energy generation and DTE Energy generated production tax credits from renewable gas recovery, reduced emission fuel, and gas production operations.  If the Registrants' production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an IRS audit or changes in tax law, there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact the Registrants' earnings and cash flows.If DTE Energy's goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, it may be required to record a charge to earnings.  DTE Energy annually reviews the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions it has made for impairment.  Goodwill and other intangible assets are also reviewed on a quarterly basis whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.  Factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, slower industry growth rates, or material changes with customers or contracts that could negatively impact future cash flows.  DTE Energy cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of such changes or any subsequent recovery.  If the carrying value of any goodwill or other intangible assets are determined to be not recoverable, DTE Energy may take a non-cash impairment charge, which could materially impact DTE Energy's results of operations and financial position.The Registrants may not be fully covered by insurance.  The Registrants have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks, including catastrophic damage as a result of severe weather or other natural disasters, war, terrorism, cyber incidents, or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact the Registrants' operations.  Economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance, or the Registrants' insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations"

New legislation, regulations, or interpretations could change how the business operates, impact the Registrants' ability to recover costs through rates or the timing of such recovery, or require the Registrants to incur additional expenses.Changes to Michigan's electric retail access program could negatively impact the Registrants' financial performance.  The State of Michigan currently experiences a hybrid market, where the MPSC continues to regulate electric rates for DTE Electric customers, while alternative electric suppliers charge market-based rates.  MPSC rate orders, and energy legislation enacted by the State of Michigan, have placed a 10% cap on the total potential retail access migration.  However, even with the legislated 10% cap on participation, there continues to be legislative and financial risk associated with the electric retail access program.  Electric retail access migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes.  The Registrants are required under current regulation to provide full service to retail access customers that choose to return, potentially resulting in the need for additional generating capacity. 20The Registrants' electric distribution system and DTE Energy's gas distribution system are subject to risks from their operation, which could reduce revenues, increase expenses, and have a material adverse effect on their business, financial position, and results of operations.  The Registrants' electric distribution and DTE Energy’s gas distribution systems are subject to many operational risks.  These operational systems and infrastructure have been in service for many years.

Because the Registrants’ distribution systems are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of the Registrants’ systems could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties.DTE Energy's non-utility businesses may not perform to its expectations.  DTE Energy relies on non-utility operations for an increasing portion of earnings.  If DTE Energy's current and contemplated non-utility investments do not perform at expected levels, DTE Energy could experience diminished earnings and a corresponding decline in shareholder value.DTE Energy relies on cash flows from subsidiaries.  DTE Energy is a holding company.  Cash flows from the utility and non-utility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on DTE Energy debt and securities.  Should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to DTE Energy, its ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted.The Registrants' businesses have safety risks.  The Registrants' electric distribution system, power plants, renewable energy equipment, and other facilities, and DTE Energy's gas distribution system, gas infrastructure, and other facilities, could be involved in incidents that result in injury, death, or property loss to employees, customers, third parties, or the public.  Although the Registrants have insurance coverage for many potential incidents, depending upon the nature and severity of any incident, they could experience financial loss, damage to their reputation, and negative consequences from regulatory agencies or other public authorities.Environmental laws and liability may be costly.  The Registrants are subject to, and affected by, numerous environmental regulations.  These regulations govern air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharge, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste.  Compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending, operating expenses, and plant down times, and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers.Uncertainty around future environmental regulations creates difficulty planning long-term capital projects in the Registrants' generation fleet and, for DTE Energy's gas distribution businesses.

Additionally, the Registrants may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body.  The Registrants cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs.  There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties.The Registrants may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues.  Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce GHGs such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil fuels.  If increased regulations of GHG emissions are implemented, the operations of DTE Electric's fossil-fueled generation assets may be significantly impacted.  Since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process, the Registrants' financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters.For DTE Energy, future environmental regulation of natural gas extraction techniques, including hydraulic fracturing, being discussed both at the United States federal level and by some states may affect the profitability of natural gas extraction businesses which could affect demand for, and profitability of, DTE Energy's gas transportation businesses.Threats of cyber incidents, physical security, and terrorism could affect the Registrants' business.  Issues may threaten the Registrants such as cyber incidents, physical security, or terrorism that may disrupt the Registrants' operations, and could harm the Registrants' operating results. 21Information security risks have increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks, and data security breaches.  The Registrants' industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information and control technology systems and network infrastructure.  Despite implementation of security measures, all of the Registrants' technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyber incidents, physical security threats, acts of war or terrorism, and other causes, as well as loss of operational control of the Registrants' electric generation and distribution assets and, DTE Energy's gas distribution assets.  If the Registrants' information technology systems were to fail and they were unable to recover in a timely way, the Registrants may be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants' business, operating results, and financial condition.Suppliers, vendors, contractors, and information technology providers have access to systems that support the Registrants’ operations and maintain customer and employee data.  A breach of these third-party systems could adversely affect the business as if it was a breach of our own system.  Also, because the Registrants’ generation and distribution systems are part of an interconnected system, a disruption caused by a cyber incident at another utility, electric generator, system operator, or commodity supplier could also adversely affect the Registrants’ businesses, operating results, and financial condition.In addition, the Registrants' generation plants and electrical distribution facilities, and DTE Energy's gas pipeline and storage facilities, in particular, may be targets of physical security threats or terrorist activities that could disrupt the Registrants' ability to produce or distribute some portion of their products.  The Registrants have increased security as a result of past events and may be required by regulators or by the future threat environment to make investments in security that the Registrants cannot currently predict.Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect the Registrants.  In connection with the Registrants' businesses, they collect and retain personally identifiable information of their customers, shareholders, and employees.  Customers, shareholders, and employees expect that the Registrants will adequately protect their personal information.  The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding.  A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer, shareholder, employee, or Registrant data by cybercrime or otherwise, could adversely impact the Registrants' reputation, and could result in significant costs, fines, and litigation.Construction and capital improvements to the Registrants' power facilities, DTE Energy's distribution systems and its Gas Storage and Pipelines business subject them to risk.  The Registrants are managing ongoing, and planning future, significant construction and capital improvement projects at the Registrants' multiple power generation and distribution facilities, at DTE Energy's gas distribution system, and at DTE Energy's Gas Storage and Pipelines business.  Many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond the Registrants' control, including the cost of materials and labor, subcontractor performance, timing and issuance of necessary permits or approvals (including required certificates from regulatory agencies), construction disputes, impediments to acquiring rights-of-way or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms, cost overruns, and weather conditions.  Failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect the Registrants' financial performance, operations, or expected investment returns at the affected facilities, businesses and development projects.Operation of a nuclear facility subjects the Registrants to risk.  Ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects the Registrants to significant additional risks.  These risks include, among others, plant security, environmental regulation and remediation, changes in federal nuclear regulation, increased capital expenditures to meet industry requirements, and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility compared to other generation options.  Insurance maintained by the Registrants for various nuclear-related risks may not be sufficient to cover the Registrants' costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at the nuclear generating plant, which may affect the Registrants' financial performance.  In addition, the Registrants' nuclear decommissioning trust fund, to finance the decommissioning of the nuclear generating plant, may not be sufficient to fund the cost of decommissioning.  A decline in market value of assets held in decommissioning trust funds due to poor investment performance or other factors may increase the funding requirements for these obligations.  Any increase in funding requirements may have a material impact on the Registrants’ liquidity, financial position, or results of operations. 22The supply and/or price of energy commodities and/or related services may impact the Registrants' financial results.  The Registrants are dependent on coal for much of their electrical generating capacity as well as uranium for their nuclear operations.  DTE Energy's access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for utility gas customers.  DTE Energy's non-utility businesses are also dependent upon supplies and prices of energy commodities and services.  Price fluctuations, fuel supply disruptions, and changes in transportation costs, could have a negative impact on the amounts DTE Electric charges utility customers for electricity and DTE Gas charges utility customers for gas, and on the profitability of DTE Energy's non-utility businesses.  The Registrants' hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms may be insufficient to mitigate the negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices in their utility and, for DTE Energy, non-utility businesses, and the Registrants' financial performance may therefore be negatively impacted by price fluctuations.  The price of energy also impacts the market for DTE Energy's non-utility businesses that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers.The supply and/or price of other industrial raw and finished inputs and/or related services may impact the Registrants' financial results.  The Registrants are dependent on supplies of certain commodities, such as copper and limestone, among others, and industrial materials, and services in order to maintain day-to-day operations and maintenance of their facilities.  Price fluctuations, or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items, could have a negative impact on the amounts charged to customers for the Registrants' utility products and, for DTE Energy, on the profitability of the non-utility businesses.Emerging technologies may have a material adverse effect on the Registrants.  Advances in technology that produce power or reduce power consumption include cost-effective renewable energy technologies, distributed generation, energy waste reduction technologies, and energy storage devices.  Such developments may impact the price of energy, may affect energy deliveries as customer-owned generation becomes more cost-effective, may require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands, and could make portions of our electric system power supply and/or distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives.  Such technologies could also result in further declines in commodity prices or demand for delivered energy.  Each of these factors could materially affect the Registrants’ results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.Adverse changes in the Registrants' credit ratings may negatively affect them.  Regional and national economic conditions, increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes, as well as changes in the Registrants' economic performance, could result in credit agencies reexamining their credit ratings.  While credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance, a downgrade in the Registrants' credit ratings below investment grade could restrict or discontinue their ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in their borrowing costs, a reduced level of capital expenditures, and could impact future earnings and cash flows.  In addition, a reduction in the Registrants' credit ratings may require them to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energy-related commodities, products, and services, which could impact their liquidity.Poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact the Registrants' liquidity and results of operations.  The Registrants' costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation, and the Registrants' required or voluntary contributions made to the plans.  The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the Registrants' plans.  The Registrants have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations.  These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below the Registrants' projected return rates.  A decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future.  Additionally, the pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  If interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding requirements.  Also, if future increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from the Registrants' utility customers, the results of operations and financial position of the Registrants could be negatively affected.  Without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of plan assets, the Registrants could be required to fund these plans with significant amounts of cash.  Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on the Registrants' cash flows, financial position, or results of operations. 23The Registrants' ability to access capital markets is important.  The Registrants' ability to access capital markets is important to operate their businesses and to fund capital investments.  Turmoil in credit markets may constrain the Registrants' ability, as well as the ability of their subsidiaries, to issue new debt, including commercial paper, and refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates.  In addition, the level of borrowing by other energy companies, and the market as a whole, could limit the Registrants' access to capital markets.  The Registrants' long-term revolving credit facilities do not expire until 2022, but the Registrants regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects at the Registrants' utilities and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, and the Registrants cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions.DTE Energy's participation in energy trading markets subjects it to risk.  Events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole.  In certain situations, DTE Energy may be required to post collateral to support trading operations, which could be substantial.  If access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed, DTE Energy could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows.  Energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose DTE Energy to risks related to commodity price movements, deviations in weather, and other related risks.  DTE Energy's trading business routinely has speculative trading positions in the market, within strict policy guidelines DTE Energy sets, resulting from the management of DTE Energy's business portfolio.  To the extent speculative trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish DTE Energy's financial results and financial position.  DTE Energy manages its exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures.  During periods of extreme volatility, these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities.Weather significantly affects operations.  At both utilities, deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect the Registrants' earnings and cash flows.  Mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of the Registrants' assets, lowering income and cash flows.  At DTE Electric, ice storms, tornadoes, or high winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities and require it to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses.  The expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process.  DTE Gas can experience higher than anticipated expenses from emergency repairs on its gas distribution infrastructure required as a result of weather related issues.Unplanned power plant outages may be costly.  Unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations.  As a result of unforeseen maintenance, the Registrants may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed the costs of generation.  The Registrants' financial performance may be negatively affected if unable to recover such increased costs.Regional, national, and international economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on the Registrants.  The Registrants' utility and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers they serve and credit risk of counterparties they do business with.  Should the financial conditions of some of DTE Energy's significant customers deteriorate as a result of regional, national or international economic conditions, reduced volumes of electricity and gas, and demand for energy services DTE Energy supplies, collections of accounts receivable, reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding, and potentially higher levels of lost gas or stolen gas and electricity could result in decreased earnings and cash flows.Renewable portfolio standards and energy waste reduction programs may affect the Registrants' business.  The Registrants are subject to existing Michigan, and potential future, federal legislation and regulation requiring them to secure sources of renewable energy.  The Registrants have complied with the existing federal and state legislation, but do not know what requirements may be added by federal or state legislation in the future.  In addition, the Registrants expect to comply with new Michigan legislation increasing the percentage of power required to be provided by renewable energy sources.  The Registrants cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with complying with potential future legislation and regulations.  Compliance with these requirements can significantly increase capital expenditures and operating expenses and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers.The Registrants are also required by Michigan legislation to implement energy waste reduction measures and provide energy waste reduction customer awareness and education programs.  These requirements necessitate expenditures, and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing the Registrants' revenues as customers decrease their energy usage.  The Registrants cannot predict how these programs will impact their business and future operating results. 24Failure to attract and retain key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on the Registrants’ operations.  The Registrants' businesses are dependent on their ability to attract and retain skilled employees.  Competition for skilled employees in some areas is high, and the inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect the Registrants' business and future operating results.  In addition, the Registrants have an aging utility workforce, and the failure of a successful transfer of knowledge and expertise could negatively impact their operations.A work interruption may adversely affect the Registrants.  There are several bargaining units for DTE Energy's approximately 5,200 and DTE Electric's approximately 2,800 represented employees.  The majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in 2020 and 2021.  A union choosing to strike would have an impact on the Registrants' businesses.  The Registrants are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on their costs of operations and financial performance.DTE Energy's ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited.  To reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil, the Internal Revenue Code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and electricity from alternative sources.  DTE Energy generated production tax credits from coke production, renewable gas recovery, reduced emission fuel, and gas production operations, and for the Registrants, renewable energy generation.  If the Registrants' production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an IRS audit or changes in tax law, there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact the Registrants' earnings and cash flows.If DTE Energy's goodwill becomes impaired, it may be required to record a charge to earnings.  DTE Energy annually reviews the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions it has made for impairment.  Factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include any change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of DTE Energy goodwill may not be recoverable, such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization, future cash flows, and slower growth rates in the industry.  DTE Energy cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery, worldwide or in the economy or markets in which it operates; however, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, DTE Energy may take a non-cash impairment charge, which could potentially materially impact DTE Energy's results of operations and financial position.The Registrants may not be fully covered by insurance.  The Registrants have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks, including catastrophic damage as a result of severe weather or other natural disasters, war, terrorism, or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact the Registrants' operations.  Economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance, or the Registrants' insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations"
0,DTE,DTE ENERGY CO,2018-02-16,"Risk Factors
There are various risks associated with the operations of the Registrants' utility businesses and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses.  To provide a framework to understand the operating environment of the Registrants, below is a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with their businesses.  Although the Registrants have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors, others could emerge in the future.  Each of the following risks could affect performance. 20The Registrants are subject to rate regulation.  Electric and gas rates for the utilities are set by the MPSC and the FERC and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization.  The Registrants may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the MPSC, the FERC, or other regulatory bodies.  The Registrants' ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers' rates.  Regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers' rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under current governing laws and regulations.  Regulators may also disagree with the Registrants' rate calculations under the various mechanisms that are intended to mitigate the risk to their utilities related to certain aspects of the business.  If the Registrants cannot agree with regulators on an appropriate reconciliation of those mechanisms, it may impact the Registrants' ability to recover certain costs through customer rates.  Regulators may also decide to eliminate these mechanisms in future rate cases, which may make it more difficult for the Registrants to recover their costs in the rates charged to customers.  The Registrants cannot predict what rates the MPSC will authorize in future rate cases.  New legislation, regulations, or interpretations could change how the business operates, impact the Registrants' ability to recover costs through rates or the timing of such recovery, or require the Registrants to incur additional expenses.Changes to Michigan's electric retail access program could negatively impact the Registrants' financial performance.  The State of Michigan currently experiences a hybrid market, where the MPSC continues to regulate electric rates for DTE Electric customers, while alternative electric suppliers charge market-based rates.  MPSC rate orders, and energy legislation enacted by the State of Michigan, have placed a 10% cap on the total potential retail access migration.  However, even with the legislated 10% cap on participation, there continues to be legislative and financial risk associated with the electric retail access program.  Electric retail access migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes.  The Registrants are required under current regulation to provide full service to retail access customers that choose to return, potentially resulting in the need for additional generating capacity.Environmental laws and liability may be costly.  The Registrants are subject to, and affected by, numerous environmental regulations.  These regulations govern air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharge, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste.  Compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending, operating expenses, and plant down times, and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers.Uncertainty around future environmental regulations creates difficulty planning long-term capital projects in the Registrants' generation fleet and, for DTE Energy's gas distribution businesses.  These laws and regulations require the Registrants to seek a variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections, and other regulatory approvals.  The Registrants could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities, including the retirement of certain generating plants, based on these regulations.  Additionally, the Registrants may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body.  The Registrants cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs.  There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties.The Registrants may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues.  Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce GHGs such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil fuels.  If increased regulations of GHG emissions are implemented, the operations of DTE Electric's fossil-fueled generation assets may be significantly impacted.  Since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process, the Registrants' financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters.For DTE Energy, future environmental regulation of natural gas extraction techniques, including hydraulic fracturing, being discussed both at the United States federal level and by some states may affect the profitability of natural gas extraction businesses which could affect demand for, and profitability of, DTE Energy's gas transportation businesses.DTE Energy's non-utility businesses may not perform to its expectations.  DTE Energy relies on non-utility operations for an increasing portion of earnings.  If DTE Energy's current and contemplated non-utility investments do not perform at expected levels, DTE Energy could experience diminished earnings and a corresponding decline in shareholder value.DTE Energy relies on cash flows from subsidiaries.  DTE Energy is a holding company.  Cash flows from the utility and non-utility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on DTE Energy debt and securities.  Should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to DTE Energy, its ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted. 21Threats of cyber crime, physical security, and terrorism could affect the Registrants' business.  The Registrants may be threatened by issues such as cyber crime, physical security, or terrorism that may disrupt the Registrants' operations, and could harm the Registrants' operating results. Cyber crime, which includes the use of malware, computer viruses, and other means for disruption or unauthorized access against companies, including the Registrants, has increased in frequency, scope, and potential impact in recent years.  The Registrants' industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure.  Despite implementation of security measures, all of the Registrants' technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyber crime, physical security threats, acts of war or terrorism, and other causes.  If the Registrants' information technology systems were to fail and they were unable to recover in a timely way, the Registrants may be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants' business, operating results, and financial condition.In addition, the Registrants' generation plants and electrical distribution facilities, and DTE Energy's gas pipeline and storage facilities, in particular, may be targets of physical security threats or terrorist activities that could disrupt the Registrants' ability to produce or distribute some portion of their products.  The Registrants have increased security as a result of past events and may be required by regulators or by the future threat environment to make investments in security that the Registrants cannot currently predict.Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect the Registrants.  In connection with the Registrants' businesses, they collect and retain personally identifiable information of their customers, shareholders, and employees.  Customers, shareholders, and employees expect that the Registrants will adequately protect their personal information.  The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding.  A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer, shareholder, employee, or Registrant data by cybercrime or otherwise, could adversely impact the Registrants' reputation, and could result in significant costs, fines, and litigation.Operation of a nuclear facility subjects the Registrants to risk.  Ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects the Registrants to significant additional risks.  These risks include, among others, plant security, environmental regulation and remediation, changes in federal nuclear regulation, increased capital expenditures to meet industry requirements, and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility compared to other generation options.  While the Registrants maintain insurance for various nuclear-related risks, there can be no assurances that such insurance will be sufficient to cover the Registrants' costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at the nuclear generating plant, which may affect the Registrants' financial performance.  In addition, while the Registrants have a nuclear decommissioning trust fund to finance the decommissioning of the nuclear generating plant, there can be no assurances that such fund will be sufficient to fund the cost of decommissioning.  A decline in market value of assets held in decommissioning trust funds due to poor investment performance or other factors may increase the funding requirements for these obligations.  Any increase in funding requirements may have a material impact on the Registrants’ liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.Construction and capital improvements to the Registrants' power facilities, DTE Energy's distribution systems and its Gas Storage and Pipelines business subject them to risk.  The Registrants are managing ongoing, and planning future, significant construction and capital improvement projects at DTE Electric's multiple power generation and distribution facilities, at DTE Energy's gas distribution system, and at DTE Energy's Gas Storage and Pipelines business.  Many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond the Registrants' control, including the cost of materials and labor, subcontractor performance, timing and issuance of necessary permits or approvals (including required certificates from regulatory agencies), construction disputes, impediments to acquiring rights-of-way or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms, cost overruns, and weather conditions.  Failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect the Registrants' financial performance, operations, or expected investment returns at the affected facilities, businesses and development projects. 22The supply and/or price of energy commodities and/or related services may impact the Registrants' financial results.  The Registrants are dependent on coal for much of their electrical generating capacity.  DTE Energy's access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for utility gas customers.  DTE Energy's non-utility businesses are also dependent upon supplies and prices of energy commodities and services.  Price fluctuations, fuel supply disruptions, and changes in transportation costs, could have a negative impact on the amounts DTE Electric charges utility customers for electricity and DTE Gas charges utility customers for gas and on the profitability of DTE Energy's non-utility businesses.  The Registrants have hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms in place to mitigate some of the negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices in their utility and, for DTE Energy, non-utility businesses, but there can be no assurances that the Registrants' financial performance will not be negatively impacted by price fluctuations.  The price of energy also impacts the market for DTE Energy's non-utility businesses that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers.The supply and/or price of other industrial raw and finished inputs and/or related services may impact the Registrants' financial results.  The Registrants are dependent on supplies of certain commodities, such as copper and limestone, among others, and industrial materials, and services in order to maintain day-to-day operations and maintenance of their facilities.  Price fluctuations, or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items, could have a negative impact on the amounts charged to customers for the Registrants' utility products and, for DTE Energy, on the profitability of the non-utility businesses.Emerging technologies may have a material adverse effect on the Registrants.  Advances in technology that produce power or reduce power consumption include cost-effective renewable energy technologies, distributed generation, energy efficiency technologies, and energy storage devices.  Such developments may impact the price of energy, may affect energy deliveries as customer-owned generation becomes more cost-effective, may require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands, and could make portions of our electric system power supply and/or distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives.  Such technologies could also result in further declines in commodity prices or demand for delivered energy.  Each of these factors could materially affect the Registrants’ results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.Adverse changes in the Registrants' credit ratings may negatively affect them.  Regional and national economic conditions, increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes, as well as changes in the Registrants' economic performance, could result in credit agencies reexamining their credit ratings.  While credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance, a downgrade in the Registrants' credit ratings below investment grade could restrict or discontinue their ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in their borrowing costs, a reduced level of capital expenditures, and could impact future earnings and cash flows.  In addition, a reduction in the Registrants' credit ratings may require them to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energy-related commodities, products, and services, which could impact their liquidity.Poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact the Registrants' liquidity and results of operations.  The Registrants' costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation, and the Registrants' required or voluntary contributions made to the plans.  The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the Registrants' plans.  The Registrants have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations.  These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below the Registrants' projected return rates.  A decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future.  Additionally, the pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding requirements.  Also, if future increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from the Registrants' utility customers, the results of operations and financial position of the Registrants could be negatively affected.  Without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of plan assets, the Registrants could be required to fund these plans with significant amounts of cash.  Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on the Registrants' cash flows, financial position, or results of operations. 23The Registrants' ability to access capital markets is important.  The Registrants' ability to access capital markets is important to operate their businesses and to fund capital investments.  Turmoil in credit markets may constrain the Registrants' ability, as well as the ability of their subsidiaries, to issue new debt, including commercial paper, and refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates.  In addition, the level of borrowing by other energy companies, and the market as a whole, could limit the Registrants' access to capital markets.  The Registrants' long-term revolving credit facilities do not expire until 2022, but the Registrants regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects at the Registrants' utilities and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, and the Registrants cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions.DTE Energy's participation in energy trading markets subjects it to risk.  Events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole.  In certain situations, DTE Energy may be required to post collateral to support trading operations, which could be substantial.  If access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed, DTE Energy could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows.  Energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose DTE Energy to risks related to commodity price movements, deviations in weather, and other related risks.  DTE Energy's trading business routinely has speculative trading positions in the market, within strict policy guidelines DTE Energy sets, resulting from the management of DTE Energy's business portfolio.  To the extent speculative trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish DTE Energy's financial results and financial position.  DTE Energy manages its exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures.  During periods of extreme volatility, these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities.DTE Energy's ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited.  To reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil, the Internal Revenue Code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and electricity from alternative sources.  DTE Energy generated production tax credits from coke production, landfill gas recovery, reduced emission fuel, renewable energy generation, and gas production operations.  If DTE Energy's production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an IRS audit or changes in tax law there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact DTE Energy's earnings and cash flows.Weather significantly affects operations.  At both utilities, deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect the Registrants' earnings and cash flows.  Mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of the Registrants' assets, lowering income and cash flows.  At DTE Electric, ice storms, tornadoes, or high winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities and require it to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses.  The expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process.  DTE Gas can experience higher than anticipated expenses from emergency repairs on its gas distribution infrastructure required as a result of weather related issues.Unplanned power plant outages may be costly.  Unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations.  As a result of unforeseen maintenance, the Registrants may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed the costs of generation.  The Registrants' financial performance may be negatively affected if unable to recover such increased costs.Renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency programs may affect the Registrants' business.  The Registrants are subject to existing Michigan, and potential future, federal legislation and regulation requiring them to secure sources of renewable energy.  The Registrants have complied with the existing federal and state legislation, but do not know what requirements may be added by federal or state legislation in the future.  In addition, the Registrants expect to comply with new Michigan legislation increasing the percentage of power required to be provided by renewable energy sources.  The Registrants cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with complying with potential future legislation and regulations.  Compliance with these requirements can significantly increase capital expenditures and operating expenses and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers.The Registrants are also required by Michigan legislation to implement energy efficiency measures and provide energy efficiency customer awareness and education programs.  These requirements necessitate expenditures, and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing the Registrants' revenues as customers decrease their energy usage.  The Registrants cannot predict how these programs will impact their business and future operating results. 24Regional, national, and international economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on the Registrants.  The Registrants' utility and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers they serve and credit risk of counterparties they do business with.  Should the financial conditions of some of DTE Energy's significant customers deteriorate as a result of regional, national or international economic conditions, reduced volumes of electricity and gas, and demand for energy services DTE Energy supplies, collections of accounts receivable, reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding, and potentially higher levels of lost gas or stolen gas and electricity could result in decreased earnings and cash flows.Failure to attract and retain key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on the Registrants’ operations.  The Registrants' businesses are dependent on their ability to attract and retain skilled employees.  Competition for skilled employees in some areas is high, and the inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect the Registrants' business and future operating results.  In addition, the Registrants have an aging utility workforce, and the failure of a successful transfer of knowledge and expertise could negatively impact their operations.A work interruption may adversely affect the Registrants.  There are several bargaining units for DTE Energy's approximately 5,000 and DTE Electric's approximately 2,700 represented employees.  The majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in 2020 and 2021.  A union choosing to strike would have an impact on the Registrants' businesses.  The Registrants are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on their costs of operations and financial performance.If DTE Energy's goodwill becomes impaired, it may be required to record a charge to earnings.  DTE Energy annually reviews the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions it has made for impairment.  Factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include any change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of DTE Energy goodwill may not be recoverable, such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization, future cash flows, and slower growth rates in the industry.  DTE Energy cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery, worldwide or in the economy or markets in which it operates; however, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, DTE Energy may take a non-cash impairment charge, which could potentially materially impact DTE Energy's results of operations and financial position.The Registrants' businesses have safety risks.  The Registrants' electric distribution system, power plants, renewable energy equipment, and other facilities, and DTE Energy's gas distribution system, gas infrastructure, and other facilities, could be involved in incidents that result in injury, death, or property loss to employees, customers, or the public.  Although the Registrants have insurance coverage for many potential incidents, depending upon the nature and severity of any incident, they could experience financial loss, damage to their reputation, and negative consequences from regulatory agencies or other public authorities.The Registrants may not be fully covered by insurance.  The Registrants have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks, including catastrophic damage as a result of severe weather or other natural disasters, war, terrorism, or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact the Registrants' operations.  Economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance, or the Registrants' insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations"
11,DTE,DTE ENERGY CO,2017-02-09,"Risk Factors
There are various risks associated with the operations of the Registrants' utility businesses and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses.  To provide a framework to understand the operating environment of the Registrants, below is a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with their businesses.  Although the Registrants have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors, others could emerge in the future.  Each of the following risks could affect performance.The Registrants are subject to rate regulation.  Electric and gas rates for the utilities are set by the MPSC and the FERC and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization.  The Registrants may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the MPSC, the FERC, or other regulatory bodies.  The Registrants' ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers' rates.  Regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers' rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under current governing laws and regulations.  Regulators may also disagree with the Registrants' rate calculations under the various mechanisms that are intended to mitigate the risk to their utilities related to certain aspects of the business.  If the Registrants cannot agree with regulators on an appropriate reconciliation of those mechanisms, it may impact the Registrants' ability to recover certain costs through customer rates.  Regulators may also decide to eliminate these mechanisms in future rate cases, which may make it more difficult for the Registrants to recover their costs in the rates charged to customers.  The Registrants cannot predict what rates the MPSC will authorize in future rate cases.  New legislation, regulations, or interpretations could change how the business operates, impact the Registrants' ability to recover costs through rates or the timing of such recovery, or require the Registrants to incur additional expenses. 18Changes to Michigan's electric retail access program could negatively impact the Registrants' financial performance.  The State of Michigan currently experiences a hybrid market, where the MPSC continues to regulate electric rates for DTE Electric customers, while alternative electric suppliers charge market-based rates.  MPSC rate orders, and energy legislation enacted by the State of Michigan, have placed a 10% cap on the total potential retail access migration.  However, even with the legislated 10% cap on participation, there continues to be legislative and financial risk associated with the electric retail access program.  Electric retail access migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes.  The Registrants are required under current regulation to provide full service to retail access customers that choose to return, potentially resulting in the need for additional generating capacity.The MISO regional energy market, including the State of Michigan, is expected to face capacity constraints due primarily to the retirement of coal-fired generation caused by increasingly stringent environmental requirements.  Significant investment in new natural gas-fired generation and renewables will be required.Environmental laws and liability may be costly.  The Registrants are subject to, and affected by, numerous environmental regulations.  These regulations govern air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharge, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste.  Compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending, operating expenses, and plant down times, and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers.Uncertainty around future environmental regulations creates difficulty planning long-term capital projects in the Registrants' generation fleet and, for DTE Energy, gas distribution businesses.  These laws and regulations require the Registrants to seek a variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections, and other regulatory approvals.  The Registrants could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities, including the retirement of certain generating plants, based on these regulations.  Additionally, the Registrants may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body.  The Registrants cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs.  There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties.The Registrants may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues.  Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce GHGs such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil fuels.  If increased regulations of GHG emissions are implemented, the operations of DTE Electric's fossil-fueled generation assets may be significantly impacted.  Since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process, the Registrants' financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters.For DTE Energy, future environmental regulation of natural gas extraction techniques, including hydraulic fracturing, being discussed both at the United States federal level and by some states may affect the profitability of natural gas extraction businesses which could affect demand for, and profitability of, DTE Energy's gas transportation businesses.Operation of a nuclear facility subjects the Registrants to risk.  Ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects the Registrants to significant additional risks.  These risks include, among others, plant security, environmental regulation and remediation, changes in federal nuclear regulation, increased capital expenditures to meet industry requirements, and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility compared to other generation options.  While the Registrants maintain insurance for various nuclear-related risks, there can be no assurances that such insurance will be sufficient to cover the Registrants' costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at the nuclear generating plant, which may affect the Registrants' financial performance.  In addition, while the Registrants have a nuclear decommissioning trust fund to finance the decommissioning of the nuclear generating plant, there can be no assurances that such fund will be sufficient to fund the cost of decommissioning.The supply and/or price of energy commodities and/or related services may impact the Registrants' financial results.  The Registrants are dependent on coal for much of their electrical generating capacity.  DTE Energy's access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for utility gas customers.  DTE Energy's non-utility businesses are also dependent upon supplies and prices of energy commodities and services.  Price fluctuations, fuel supply disruptions, and changes in transportation costs, could have a negative impact on the amounts DTE Electric charges utility customers for electricity and DTE Gas charges utility customers for gas and on the profitability of DTE Energy's non-utility businesses.  The Registrants have hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms in place to mitigate some of the negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices in their utility and, for DTE Energy, non-utility businesses, but there can be no assurances that the Registrants' financial performance will not be negatively impacted by price fluctuations.  The price of energy also impacts the market for DTE Energy's non-utility businesses that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers. 19The supply and/or price of other industrial raw and finished inputs and/or related services may impact the Registrants' financial results.  The Registrants are dependent on supplies of certain commodities, such as copper and limestone, among others, and industrial materials, and services in order to maintain day-to-day operations and maintenance of their facilities.  Price fluctuations, or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items, could have a negative impact on the amounts charged to customers for the Registrants' utility products and, for DTE Energy, on the profitability of the non-utility businesses.Adverse changes in the Registrants' credit ratings may negatively affect them.  Regional and national economic conditions, increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes, as well as changes in the Registrants' economic performance, could result in credit agencies reexamining their credit ratings.  While credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance, a downgrade in the Registrants' credit ratings below investment grade could restrict or discontinue their ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in their borrowing costs, a reduced level of capital expenditures, and could impact future earnings and cash flows.  In addition, a reduction in the Registrants' credit ratings may require them to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energy-related commodities, products, and services, which could impact their liquidity.Poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact the Registrants' liquidity and results of operations.  The Registrants' costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation, and the Registrants' required or voluntary contributions made to the plans.  The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the Registrants' plans.  The Registrants have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations.  These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below the Registrants' projected return rates.  A decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future.  Additionally, the pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding requirements.  Also, if future increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from the Registrants' utility customers, the results of operations and financial position of the Registrants could be negatively affected.  Without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of plan assets, the Registrants could be required to fund these plans with significant amounts of cash.  Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on the Registrants' cash flows, financial position, or results of operations.The Registrants' ability to access capital markets is important.  The Registrants' ability to access capital markets is important to operate their businesses and to fund capital investments.  Turmoil in credit markets may constrain the Registrants' ability, as well as the ability of their subsidiaries, to issue new debt, including commercial paper, and refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates.  In addition, the level of borrowing by other energy companies, and the market as a whole, could limit the Registrants' access to capital markets.  The Registrants' long-term revolving credit facilities do not expire until 2021, but the Registrants regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects at the Registrants' utilities and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, and the Registrants cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions.Construction and capital improvements to the Registrants' power facilities, DTE Energy's distribution systems and its Gas Storage and Pipelines business subject them to risk.  The Registrants are managing ongoing, and planning future, significant construction and capital improvement projects at DTE Electric's multiple power generation and distribution facilities, at DTE Energy's gas distribution system, and at DTE Energy's Gas, Storage and Pipelines business.  Many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond the Registrants' control, including the cost of materials and labor, subcontractor performance, timing and issuance of necessary permits or approvals (including required certificates from regulatory agencies), construction disputes, impediments to acquiring rights-of-way or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms, cost overruns and weather conditions.  Failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect the Registrants' financial performance, operations, or expected investment returns at the affected facilities, businesses and development projects.DTE Energy's non-utility businesses may not perform to its expectations.  DTE Energy relies on non-utility operations for an increasing portion of earnings.  If DTE Energy's current and contemplated non-utility investments do not perform at expected levels, DTE Energy could experience diminished earnings and a corresponding decline in shareholder value. 20DTE Energy's participation in energy trading markets subjects it to risk.  Events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole.  In certain situations, DTE Energy may be required to post collateral to support trading operations, which could be substantial.  If access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed, DTE Energy could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows.  Energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose DTE Energy to risks related to commodity price movements, deviations in weather, and other related risks.  DTE Energy's trading business routinely has speculative trading positions in the market, within strict policy guidelines DTE Energy sets, resulting from the management of DTE Energy's business portfolio.  To the extent speculative trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish DTE Energy's financial results and financial position.  DTE Energy manages its exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures.  During periods of extreme volatility, these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities.DTE Energy's ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited.  To reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil, the Internal Revenue Code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and electricity from alternative sources.  DTE Energy generated production tax credits from coke production, landfill gas recovery, reduced emission fuel, renewable energy generation, and gas production operations.  If DTE Energy's production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an IRS audit, there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact DTE Energy's earnings and cash flows.Weather significantly affects operations.  At both utilities, deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect the Registrants' earnings and cash flows.  Mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of the Registrants' assets, lowering income and cash flows.  At DTE Electric, ice storms, tornadoes, or high winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities and require it to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses.  The expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process.  DTE Gas can experience higher than anticipated expenses from emergency repairs on its gas distribution infrastructure required as a result of weather related issues.Unplanned power plant outages may be costly.  Unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations.  As a result of unforeseen maintenance, the Registrants may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed the costs of generation.  The Registrants' financial performance may be negatively affected if unable to recover such increased costs.DTE Energy relies on cash flows from subsidiaries.  DTE Energy is a holding company.  Cash flows from the utility and non-utility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on DTE Energy debt and securities.  Should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to DTE Energy, its ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted.Renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency programs may affect the Registrants' business.  The Registrants are subject to existing Michigan, and potential future, federal legislation and regulation requiring them to secure sources of renewable energy.  The Registrants have complied with the existing state legislation, but do not know what requirements may be added by federal legislation.  In addition, the Registrants expect to comply with new Michigan legislation increasing the percentage of power required to be provided by renewable energy sources.  The Registrants cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with complying with potential future legislation and regulations.  Compliance with these requirements can significantly increase capital expenditures and operating expenses and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers.The Registrants are also required by Michigan legislation to implement energy efficiency measures and provide energy efficiency customer awareness and education programs.  These requirements necessitate expenditures, and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing the Registrants' revenues as customers decrease their energy usage.  The Registrants cannot predict how these programs will impact their business and future operating results.Regional, national, and international economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on the Registrants.  The Registrants' utility and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers they serve and credit risk of counterparties they do business with.  Should the financial conditions of some of DTE Energy's significant customers deteriorate as a result of regional, national or international economic conditions, reduced volumes of electricity and gas, and demand for energy services DTE Energy supplies, collections of accounts receivable, reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding, and potentially higher levels of lost gas or stolen gas and electricity could result in decreased earnings and cash flows. 21Threats of cyber crime and terrorism could affect the Registrants' business.  The Registrants may be threatened by issues such as cyber crime or terrorism that may disrupt the Registrants' operations and could harm the Registrants' operating results. Cyber crime, which includes the use of malware, computer viruses, and other means for disruption or unauthorized access against companies, including the Registrants, has increased in frequency, scope, and potential impact in recent years.  The Registrants' industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure.  Despite implementation of security measures, all of the Registrants' technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyber crime, acts of war or terrorism, and other causes.  If the Registrants' information technology systems were to fail and they were unable to recover in a timely way, the Registrants might be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants' business, operating results, and financial condition.In addition, the Registrants' generation plants and electrical distribution facilities and, for DTE Energy, gas pipeline and storage facilities, in particular may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt the Registrants' ability to produce or distribute some portion of their products.  The Registrants have increased security as a result of past events and may be required by regulators or by the future terrorist threat environment to make investments in security that the Registrants cannot currently predict.Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect the Registrants.  In connection with the Registrants' businesses, they collect and retain personally identifiable information of their customers, shareholders, and employees.  Customers, shareholders, and employees expect that the Registrants will adequately protect their personal information, and the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding.  A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer, shareholder, employee, or Registrant data by cybercrime or otherwise could adversely impact the Registrants' reputation and could result in significant costs, fines, and litigation.Failure to successfully implement new processes and information systems could interrupt the Registrants’ operations.  Registrants' businesses depend on numerous information systems for operations, financial information, and billings.  The Registrants are in the midst of an initiative to replace its customer billing systems in the second quarter of 2017.  Failure to successfully implement this initiative could affect the Registrants ability to timely and accurately bill and collect from its customers which could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants’ business, operating results and financial condition.Failure to attract and retain key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on the Registrants’ operations.  The Registrants' businesses are dependent on their ability to attract and retain skilled employees.  Competition for skilled employees in some areas is high, and the inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect the Registrants' business and future operating results.  In addition, the Registrants have an aging utility workforce, and the failure of a successful transfer of knowledge and expertise could negatively impact their operations.A work interruption may adversely affect the Registrants.  There are several bargaining units for DTE Energy's approximately 4,800 and DTE Electric's approximately 2,600 represented employees.  The majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in 2017 and 2020.  A union choosing to strike would have an impact on the Registrants' businesses.  The Registrants are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on their costs of operations and financial performance.If DTE Energy's goodwill becomes impaired, it may be required to record a charge to earnings.  DTE Energy annually reviews the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions it has made for impairment.  Factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include any change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of DTE Energy goodwill may not be recoverable, such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization, future cash flows, and slower growth rates in the industry.  DTE Energy cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery, worldwide or in the economy or markets in which it operates; however, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, DTE Energy may take a non-cash impairment charge, which could potentially materially impact DTE Energy's results of operations and financial position.The Registrants' businesses have safety risks.  The Registrants' electric distribution system, power plants, renewable energy equipment, and other facilities, and DTE Energy's gas distribution system, gas infrastructure, and other facilities, could be involved in incidents that result in injury, death, or property loss to employees, customers, or the public.  Although the Registrants have insurance coverage for many potential incidents, depending upon the nature and severity of any incident, they could experience financial loss, damage to their reputation, and negative consequences from regulatory agencies or other public authorities. 22The Registrants may not be fully covered by insurance.  The Registrants have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks, including catastrophic damage as a result of acts of God, terrorism, or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact the Registrants' operations.  Economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance, or the Registrants' insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations"
9,DTE,DTE ENERGY CO,2016-02-10,"Risk Factors
There are various risks associated with the operations of the Registrants' utility businesses and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses.  To provide a framework to understand the operating environment of the Registrants, below is a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with their businesses.  Although the Registrants have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors, others could emerge in the future.  Each of the following risks could affect performance.The Registrants are subject to rate regulation.  Electric and gas rates for the utilities are set by the MPSC and the FERC and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization.  The Registrants may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the MPSC, the FERC, or other regulatory bodies.  The Registrants' ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers' rates.  Regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers' rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under current governing laws and regulations.  The Registrants' utilities typically self-implement base rate changes six months after rate case filings, in accordance with Michigan law.  However, if the final rates authorized by regulators in the final rate order are lower than the amounts the Registrants collected during the self-implementation period, the Registrants must refund the difference with interest.  Regulators may also disagree with the Registrants' rate calculations under the various mechanisms that are intended to mitigate the risk to their utilities related to certain aspects of the business.  If the Registrants cannot agree with regulators on an appropriate reconciliation of those mechanisms, it may impact the Registrants' ability to recover certain costs through customer rates.  Regulators may also decide to eliminate these mechanisms in future rate cases, which may make it more difficult for the Registrants to recover their costs in the rates charged to customers.  The Registrants cannot predict what rates the MPSC will authorize in future rate cases.  New legislation, regulations, or interpretations could change how the business operates, impact the Registrants' ability to recover costs through rates or the timing of such recovery, or require the Registrants to incur additional expenses.  The outcome of the current Michigan energy policy reform legislative process could impact the Registrants' recovery of costs through rates.Changes to Michigan's electric retail access program could negatively impact the Registrants' financial performance.  The State of Michigan currently experiences a hybrid market, where the MPSC continues to regulate electric rates for DTE Electric customers, while alternative electric suppliers charge market-based rates.  MPSC rate orders, and energy legislation enacted by the State of Michigan in 2008, have placed a 10% cap on the total potential retail access migration.  However, even with the legislated 10% cap on participation, there continues to be legislative and financial risk associated with the electric retail access program.  Electric retail access migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes.  The Registrants are required under current regulation to provide full service to retail access customers that choose to return, potentially resulting in the need for additional generating capacity.  The outcome of the current Michigan energy policy reform legislative process could impact the Registrants' recovery of costs through rates.The MISO regional energy market, including the State of Michigan, is expected to face capacity constraints beginning in 2016, due primarily to the retirement of coal-fired generation caused by increasingly stringent environmental requirements.  Significant investment in new natural gas-fired generation and renewables will be required.  Under the current regulatory structure, retail access customers do not fund capacity costs, potentially impacting electric supply reliability and utility customer affordability.Environmental laws and liability may be costly.  The Registrants are subject to, and affected by, numerous environmental regulations.  These regulations govern air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharge, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste.  Compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending, operating expenses, and plant down times, and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers.Uncertainty around future environmental regulations creates difficulty planning long-term capital projects in the Registrants' generation fleet and, for DTE Energy, gas distribution businesses.  These laws and regulations require the Registrants to seek a variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections, and other regulatory approvals.  The Registrants could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities, including the retirement of certain generating plants, based on these regulations.  Additionally, the Registrants may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body.  The Registrants cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs.  There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties. 18The Registrants may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues.  Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce GHGs such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil fuels.  If increased regulations of GHG emissions are implemented, the operations of DTE Electric's fossil-fueled generation assets may be significantly impacted.  Since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process, the Registrants' financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters.For DTE Energy, future environmental regulation of natural gas extraction techniques, including hydraulic fracturing, being discussed both at the United States federal level and by some states may affect the profitability of natural gas extraction businesses which could affect demand for, and profitability of, DTE Energy's gas transportation businesses.Operation of a nuclear facility subjects the Registrants to risk.  Ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects the Registrants to significant additional risks.  These risks include, among others, plant security, environmental regulation and remediation, changes in federal nuclear regulation, increased capital expenditures to meet industry requirements, and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility.  While the Registrants maintain insurance for various nuclear-related risks, there can be no assurances that such insurance will be sufficient to cover the Registrants' costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at the nuclear generating plant, which may affect the Registrants' financial performance.  In addition, while the Registrants have a nuclear decommissioning trust fund to finance the decommissioning of the nuclear generating plant, there can be no assurances that such fund will be sufficient to fund the cost of decommissioning.The supply and/or price of energy commodities and/or related services may impact the Registrants' financial results.  The Registrants are dependent on coal for much of their electrical generating capacity.  DTE Energy's access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for utility gas customers.  DTE Energy's non-utility businesses are also dependent upon supplies and prices of energy commodities and services.  Price fluctuations, fuel supply disruptions, and changes in transportation costs, could have a negative impact on the amounts DTE Electric charges utility customers for electricity and DTE Gas charges utility customers for gas and on the profitability of DTE Energy's non-utility businesses.  The Registrants have hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms in place to mitigate some of the negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices in their utility and, for DTE Energy, non-utility businesses, but there can be no assurances that the Registrants' financial performance will not be negatively impacted by price fluctuations.  The price of energy also impacts the market for DTE Energy's non-utility businesses that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers.The supply and/or price of other industrial raw and finished inputs and/or related services may impact the Registrants' financial results.  The Registrants are dependent on supplies of certain commodities, such as copper and limestone, among others, and industrial materials, and services in order to maintain day-to-day operations and maintenance of their facilities.  Price fluctuations, or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items, could have a negative impact on the amounts charged to customers for the Registrants' utility products and, for DTE Energy, on the profitability of the non-utility businesses.Adverse changes in the Registrants' credit ratings may negatively affect them.  Regional and national economic conditions, increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes, as well as changes in the Registrants' economic performance, could result in credit agencies reexamining their credit ratings.  While credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance, a downgrade in the Registrants' credit ratings below investment grade could restrict or discontinue their ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in their borrowing costs, a reduced level of capital expenditures, and could impact future earnings and cash flows.  In addition, a reduction in the Registrants' credit ratings may require them to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energy-related commodities, products, and services, which could impact their liquidity. 19Poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact the Registrants' liquidity and results of operations.  The Registrants' costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation, and the Registrants' required or voluntary contributions made to the plans.  The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the Registrants' plans.  The Registrants have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations.  These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below the Registrants' projected return rates.  A decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future.  Additionally, the pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding requirements.  Also, if future increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from the Registrants' utility customers, the results of operations and financial position of the Registrants could be negatively affected.  Without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of plan assets, the Registrants could be required to fund these plans with significant amounts of cash.  Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on the Registrants' cash flows, financial position, or results of operations.The Registrants' ability to access capital markets is important.  The Registrants' ability to access capital markets is important to operate their businesses and to fund capital investments.  Turmoil in credit markets may constrain the Registrants' ability, as well as the ability of their subsidiaries, to issue new debt, including commercial paper, and refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates.  In addition, the level of borrowing by other energy companies, and the market as a whole, could limit the Registrants' access to capital markets.  The Registrants' long-term revolving credit facilities do not expire until 2020, but the Registrants regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects at the Registrants' utilities and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, and the Registrants cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions.Construction and capital improvements to the Registrants' power facilities and DTE Energy's distribution systems subject them to risk.  The Registrants are managing ongoing, and planning future, significant construction and capital improvement projects at multiple power generation and distribution facilities and DTE Energy's gas distribution system.  Many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond the Registrants' control, including the cost of materials and labor, subcontractor performance, timing and issuance of necessary permits, construction disputes, and weather conditions.  Failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect the Registrants' financial performance and operations at the affected facilities and businesses.DTE Energy's non-utility businesses may not perform to its expectations.  DTE Energy relies on non-utility operations for an increasing portion of earnings.  If DTE Energy's current and contemplated non-utility investments do not perform at expected levels, DTE Energy could experience diminished earnings and a corresponding decline in shareholder value.DTE Energy's participation in energy trading markets subjects it to risk.  Events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole.  In certain situations, DTE Energy may be required to post collateral to support trading operations, which could be substantial.  If access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed, DTE Energy could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows.  Energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose DTE Energy to risks related to commodity price movements, deviations in weather, and other related risks.  DTE Energy's trading business routinely has speculative trading positions in the market, within strict policy guidelines DTE Energy sets, resulting from the management of DTE Energy's business portfolio.  To the extent speculative trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish DTE Energy's financial results and financial position.  DTE Energy manages its exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures.  During periods of extreme volatility, these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities.DTE Energy's ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited.  To reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil, the Internal Revenue Code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and electricity from alternative sources.  DTE Energy generated production tax credits from coke production, landfill gas recovery, reduced emission fuel, renewable energy generation, and gas production operations.  All production tax credits taken after 2013 are subject to audit by the IRS.  If DTE Energy's production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an IRS audit, there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact DTE Energy's earnings and cash flows. 20Weather significantly affects operations.  At both utilities, deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect the Registrants' earnings and cash flows.  Mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of the Registrants' assets, lowering income and cash flows.  At DTE Electric, ice storms, tornadoes, or high winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities and require it to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses.  The expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process.  DTE Gas can experience higher than anticipated expenses from emergency repairs on its gas distribution infrastructure required as a result of weather related issues.Unplanned power plant outages may be costly.  Unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations.  As a result of unforeseen maintenance, the Registrants may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed the costs of generation.  The Registrants' financial performance may be negatively affected if unable to recover such increased costs.DTE Energy relies on cash flows from subsidiaries.  DTE Energy is a holding company.  Cash flows from the utility and non-utility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on DTE Energy debt and securities.  Should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to DTE Energy, its ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted.Renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency programs may affect the Registrants' business.  The Registrants are subject to existing Michigan, and potential future, federal legislation and regulation requiring them to secure sources of renewable energy.  The Registrants have complied with the existing state legislation, but do not know what requirements may be added by federal legislation.  In addition, there could be additional state requirements increasing the percentage of power required to be provided by renewable energy sources.  The Registrants cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with complying with potential future legislation and regulations.  Compliance with these requirements can significantly increase capital expenditures and operating expenses and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers.The Registrants are also required by Michigan legislation to implement energy efficiency measures and provide energy efficiency customer awareness and education programs.  These requirements necessitate expenditures, and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing the Registrants' revenues as customers decrease their energy usage.  The Registrants cannot predict how these programs will impact their business and future operating results.Regional, national and international economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on the Registrants.  The Registrants' utility and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers they serve and credit risk of counterparties they do business with.  Should the financial conditions of some of DTE Energy's significant customers deteriorate as a result of regional, national or international economic conditions, reduced volumes of electricity and gas, and demand for energy services DTE Energy supplies, collections of accounts receivable, reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding, and potentially higher levels of lost gas or stolen gas and electricity could result in decreased earnings and cash flows.Threats of terrorism or cyber-attacks could affect the Registrants' business.  The Registrants may be threatened by problems such as computer viruses or terrorism that may disrupt the Registrants' operations and could harm the Registrants' operating results.  The Registrants' industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure.  Despite implementation of security measures, all of the Registrants' technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism, and other causes.  If the Registrants' information technology systems were to fail and they were unable to recover in a timely way, the Registrants might be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants' business, operating results, and financial condition.In addition, the Registrants' generation plants and electrical distribution facilities and, for DTE Energy, gas pipeline and storage facilities, in particular may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt the Registrants' ability to produce or distribute some portion of their products.  The Registrants have increased security as a result of past events and may be required by regulators or by the future terrorist threat environment to make investments in security that the Registrants cannot currently predict. 21Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect the Registrants.  In connection with the Registrant's businesses, they collect and retain personally identifiable information of their customers, shareholders, and employees.  Customers, shareholders, and employees expect that the Registrants will adequately protect their personal information, and the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding.  A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer, shareholder, employee, or Registrant data by cybercrime or otherwise could adversely impact the Registrants' reputation and could result in significant costs, fines, and litigation.Failure to attract and retain key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on the Registrants' operations.  The Registrants' businesses are dependent on their ability to attract and retain skilled employees.  Competition for skilled employees in some areas is high, and the inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect the Registrants' business and future operating results.  In addition, the Registrants have an aging utility workforce, and the failure of a successful transfer of knowledge and expertise could negatively impact their operations.A work interruption may adversely affect the Registrants.  There are several bargaining units for DTE Energy's approximately 4,900 and DTE Electric's approximately 2,600 represented employees.  The majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in 2016 and 2017.  A union choosing to strike would have an impact on the Registrants' businesses.  The Registrants are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on their costs of operations and financial performance.If DTE Energy's goodwill becomes impaired, it may be required to record a charge to earnings.  DTE Energy annually reviews the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions it has made for impairment.  Factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include any change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of DTE Energy goodwill may not be recoverable, such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization, future cash flows, and slower growth rates in the industry.  DTE Energy cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery, worldwide or in the economy or markets in which it operates; however, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, DTE Energy may take a non-cash impairment charge, which could potentially materially impact DTE Energy's results of operations and financial position.The Registrants' businesses have safety risks.  The Registrants' electric distribution system, power plants, wind energy equipment, and other facilities, and DTE Energy's gas distribution system, gas infrastructure, and other facilities, could be involved in incidents that result in injury, death or property loss to employees, customers, or the public.  Although the Registrants have insurance coverage for many potential incidents, depending upon the nature and severity of any incident, they could experience financial loss, damage to their reputation, and negative consequences from regulatory agencies or other public authorities.The Registrants may not be fully covered by insurance.  The Registrants have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks, including catastrophic damage as a result of acts of God, terrorism, or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact the Registrants' operations.  Economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance, or the Registrants' insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations"
2,DTE,DTE ENERGY CO,2015-02-13,"Risk Factors
There are various risks associated with the operations of DTE Energy's utility and non-utility businesses.  To provide a framework to understand the operating environment of DTE Energy, we are providing a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with our businesses.  Although we have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors, others could emerge in the future.  Each of the following risks could affect our performance.We are subject to rate regulation.  Electric and gas rates for our utilities are set by the MPSC and the FERC and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization.  We may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the MPSC, the FERC or other regulatory bodies.  Our ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers' rates.  Our regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers' rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under our governing laws and regulations.  Our utilities typically self-implement base rate changes six months after rate case filings in accordance with Michigan law.  However, if the final rates authorized by our regulators in the final rate order are lower than the amounts we collected during the self-implementation period, we must refund the difference with interest.  Our regulators may also disagree with our rate calculations under the various mechanisms that are intended to mitigate the risk to our utilities of certain aspects of our business.  If we cannot agree with our regulators on an appropriate reconciliation of those mechanisms, it may impact our ability to recover certain costs through our customer rates.  Our regulators may also decide to eliminate these mechanisms in future rate cases, which may make it more difficult for us to recover our costs in the rates we charge customers.  We cannot predict what rates the MPSC will authorize in future rate cases.  New legislation, regulations or interpretations could change how our business operates, impact our ability to recover costs through rates or require us to incur additional expenses.Changes to Michigan's electric Customer Choice program could negatively impact our financial performance.  The State of Michigan currently experiences a hybrid market, where the MPSC continues to regulate electric rates for our customers, while alternative electric suppliers charge market-based rates.  MPSC rate orders and energy legislation enacted by the State of Michigan in 2008 have placed a 10% cap on the total potential retail access related migration.  However, even with the legislated 10% cap on participation, there continues to be legislative and financial risk associated with the electric Customer Choice program.  Electric retail access migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes.  We are required under current regulation to provide full service to retail access customers that choose to return, potentially resulting in the need for additional generating capacity.  The MISO regional energy market, including the State of Michigan, is expected to face capacity constraints beginning in 2016 due primarily to the retirement of coal-fired generation caused by increasingly stringent environmental requirements.  Significant investment in new natural gas-fired generation and renewables will be required. Under the current regulatory structure, retail access customers do not fund capacity costs potentially impacting electric supply reliability and utility customer affordability.Environmental laws and liability may be costly.  We are subject to and affected by numerous environmental regulations.  These regulations govern air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharge and disposal of solid and hazardous waste.  Compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending, operating expenses and plant down times and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates we charge to our customers. 16Uncertainty around future environmental regulations creates difficulty planning long-term capital projects in our generation fleet and gas distribution businesses.  These laws and regulations require us to seek a variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other regulatory approvals.  We could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities, including the retirement of certain generating plants, based on these regulations.  Additionally, we may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body.  We cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean-up costs.  There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties.We may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues.  Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil fuels.  If increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions are implemented, the operations of our fossil-fuel generation assets may be significantly impacted.  Since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process, our financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters.Future environmental regulation of natural gas extraction techniques including hydraulic fracturing being discussed both at the United States federal level and by some states may affect the profitability of natural gas extraction businesses which could affect demand for and profitability of our gas transportation businesses. Operation of a nuclear facility subjects us to risk.  Ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects us to significant additional risks.  These risks include, among others, plant security, environmental regulation and remediation, changes in federal nuclear regulation and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility.  While we maintain insurance for various nuclear-related risks, there can be no assurances that such insurance will be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at our nuclear generating plant, which may affect our financial performance.  In addition, while we have a nuclear decommissioning trust fund to finance the decommissioning of our nuclear generating plant, there can be no assurances that such fund will be sufficient to fund the cost of decommissioning. The supply and/or price of energy commodities and/or related services may impact our financial results.  We are dependent on coal for much of our electrical generating capacity.  Our access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for our utility gas customers.  Our non-utility businesses are also dependent upon supplies and prices of energy commodities and services.  Price fluctuations, fuel supply disruptions and changes in transportation costs could have a negative impact on the amounts we charge our utility customers for electricity and gas and on the profitability of our non-utility businesses.  We have hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms in place to mitigate some of the negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices in our utility and non-utility businesses, but there can be no assurances that our financial performance will not be negatively impacted by price fluctuations.  The price of energy also impacts the market for our non-utility businesses that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers.The supply and/or price of other industrial raw and finished inputs and/or related services may impact our financial results.  We are dependent on supplies of certain commodities, such as copper and limestone, among others, and industrial materials and services in order to maintain day-to-day operations and maintenance of our facilities.  Price fluctuations or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items could have a negative impact on the amounts we charge our customers for our utility products and on the profitability of our non-utility businesses.Adverse changes in our credit ratings may negatively affect us.  Regional and national economic conditions, increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes, as well as changes in our economic performance, could result in credit agencies reexamining our credit rating.  While credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance, a downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade could restrict or discontinue our ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in our borrowing costs, a reduced level of capital expenditures and could impact future earnings and cash flows.  In addition, a reduction in our credit rating may require us to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energy-related commodities, products and services, which could impact our liquidity. 17Poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact our liquidity and results of operations.  Our costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation, and our required or voluntary contributions made to the plans.  The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our plans.  We have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations.  These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below our projected return rates.  A decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under our pension and other postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future.  Additionally, our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding requirements.  Also, if future increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from our utility customers, the results of operations and financial position of our company could be negatively affected.  Without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of our plan assets, we could be required to fund our plans with significant amounts of cash.  Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on our cash flows, financial position, or results of operations.Our ability to access capital markets is important.  Our ability to access capital markets is important to operate our businesses and to fund capital investments.  Turmoil in credit markets may constrain our ability, as well as the ability of our subsidiaries, to issue new debt, including commercial paper, and refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates.  In addition, the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit our access to capital markets.  Our long term revolving credit facilities do not expire until 2018, but we regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects at our utilities and non-utility businesses, and we cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions.Construction and capital improvements to our power facilities and distribution systems subject us to risk.  We are managing ongoing and planning future significant construction and capital improvement projects at multiple power generation and distribution facilities and our gas distribution system.  Many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond our control, including the cost of materials and labor, subcontractor performance, timing and issuance of necessary permits, construction disputes and weather conditions.  Failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect our financial performance and operations at the affected facilities and businesses.Our non-utility businesses may not perform to our expectations.  We rely on our non-utility operations for an increasing portion of our earnings.  If our current and contemplated non-utility investments do not perform at expected levels, we could experience diminished earnings and a corresponding decline in our shareholder value.Our participation in energy trading markets subjects us to risk.  Events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole.  In certain situations we may be required to post collateral to support trading operations, which could be substantial.  If access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed, we could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows.  Energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose us to risks related to commodity price movements, deviations in weather and other related risks.  We routinely have speculative trading positions in the market, within strict policy guidelines we set, resulting from the management of our business portfolio.  To the extent speculative trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results and financial position.  We manage our exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures.  During periods of extreme volatility, these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities.Our ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited.  To reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil, the Internal Revenue Code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and electricity from alternative sources.  We generated production tax credits from coke production, landfill gas recovery, reduced emission fuel, renewable energy generation and gas production operations.  All production tax credits taken after 2012 are subject to audit by the IRS.  If our production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an IRS audit, there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact our earnings and cash flows. 18Weather significantly affects operations.  At both utilities, deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect our earnings and cash flow.  Mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of our assets, lowering income and cash flow.  At DTE Electric, ice storms, tornadoes, or high winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities and require us to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses.  The expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process.  DTE Gas can experience higher than anticipated expenses from emergency repairs on its gas distribution infrastructure required as a result of weather related issues.Unplanned power plant outages may be costly.  Unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations.  As a result of unforeseen maintenance, we may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed our costs of generation.  Our financial performance may be negatively affected if we are unable to recover such increased costs.We rely on cash flows from subsidiaries.  DTE Energy is a holding company.  Cash flows from our utility and non-utility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on DTE Energy debt and securities.

Should national or regional economic conditions deteriorate, reduced volumes of electricity and gas, and demand for energy services we supply, collections of accounts receivable, reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding, and potentially higher levels of lost gas or stolen gas and electricity could result in decreased earnings and cash flow.Threats of terrorism or cyber-attacks could affect our business.  We may be threatened by problems such as computer viruses or terrorism that may disrupt our operations and could harm our operating results.  Our industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure.  Despite our implementation of security measures, all of our technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism and other causes.  If our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we might be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.In addition, our generation plants, gas pipeline and storage facilities and electrical distribution facilities in particular may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy products.  We have increased security as a result of past events and we may be required by our regulators or by the future terrorist threat environment to make investments in security that we cannot currently predict.Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us.  In connection with our business we collect and retain personally identifiable information of our customers, shareholders and employees.  Our customers, shareholders and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information, and the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding.  A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer, shareholder, employee or DTE Energy data by cybercrime or otherwise could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines and litigation. 19Failure to attract and retain key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on our operations.  Our business is dependent on our ability to attract and retain skilled employees.  Competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect our business and future operating results.  In addition, we have an aging utility workforce and the failure of a successful transfer of knowledge and expertise could negatively impact our operations.A work interruption may adversely affect us.  There are several bargaining units for the Company's approximately 4,900 represented employees.  The majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in 2016 and 2017.  A union choosing to strike would have an impact on our business.  We are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on our costs of operation and financial performance.If our goodwill becomes impaired, we may be required to record a charge to earnings.  We annually review the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions made by the Company for impairment.  Factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include any change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization, future cash flows, and slower growth rates in our industry.

Our non-utility businesses are also dependent upon supplies and prices of energy commodities and services.  Price fluctuations, fuel supply disruptions and changes in transportation costs could have a negative impact on the amounts we charge our utility customers for electricity and gas and on the profitability of our non-utility businesses.  We have hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms in place to mitigate some of the negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices in our utility and non-utility businesses, but there can be no assurances that our financial performance will not be negatively impacted by price fluctuations.  The price of energy also impacts the market for our non-utility businesses that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers.The supply and/or price of other industrial raw and finished inputs and/or related services may impact our financial results.  We are dependent on supplies of certain commodities, such as copper and limestone, among others, and industrial materials and services in order to maintain day-to-day operations and maintenance of our facilities.  Price fluctuations or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items could have a negative impact on the amounts we charge our customers for our utility products and on the profitability of our non-utility businesses.Adverse changes in our credit ratings may negatively affect us.  Regional and national economic conditions, increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes, as well as changes in our economic performance, could result in credit agencies reexamining our credit rating.  While credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance, a downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade could restrict or discontinue our ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in our borrowing costs, a reduced level of capital expenditures and could impact future earnings and cash flows.  In addition, a reduction in our credit rating may require us to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energy-related commodities, products and services, which could impact our liquidity.Poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact our liquidity and results of operations.  Our costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation, and our required or voluntary contributions made to the plans.  The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our plans.  We have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations.  These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below our projected return rates.  A decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under our pension and other postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future.  Additionally, our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding requirements.  Also, if future increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from our utility customers, the results of operations and financial position of our company could be negatively affected.  Without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of our plan assets, we could be required to fund our plans with significant amounts of cash.  Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on our cash flows, financial position, or results of operations. 17Our ability to access capital markets is important.  Our ability to access capital markets is important to operate our businesses.  Turmoil in credit markets may constrain our ability, as well as the ability of our subsidiaries, to issue new debt, including commercial paper, and refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates.  In addition, the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit our access to capital markets.  Our long term revolving credit facilities do not expire until 2018, but we regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects at our utilities and non-utility businesses, and we cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions.Construction and capital improvements to our power facilities and distribution systems subject us to risk.  We are managing ongoing and planning future significant construction and capital improvement projects at multiple power generation and distribution facilities and our gas distribution system.  Many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond our control, including the cost of materials and labor, subcontractor performance, timing and issuance of necessary permits, construction disputes and weather conditions.  Failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect our financial performance and operations at the affected facilities and businesses.Our non-utility businesses may not perform to our expectations.  We rely on our non-utility operations for an increasing portion of our earnings.  If our current and contemplated non-utility investments do not perform at expected levels, we could experience diminished earnings and a corresponding decline in our shareholder value.Our participation in energy trading markets subjects us to risk.  Events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole.  In certain situations we may be required to post collateral to support trading operations, which could be substantial.  If access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed, we could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows.  Energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose us to risks related to commodity price movements, deviations in weather and other related risks.  We routinely have speculative trading positions in the market, within strict policy guidelines we set, resulting from the management of our business portfolio.  To the extent speculative trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results and financial position.  We manage our exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures.  During periods of extreme volatility, these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities.Our ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited.  To reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil, the Internal Revenue Code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and electricity from alternative sources.  We generated production tax credits from coke production, landfill gas recovery, biomass fired electric generation, reduced emission fuel, renewable energy generation and gas production operations.  All production tax credits taken after 2011 are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  If our production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an IRS audit, there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact our earnings and cash flows.Weather significantly affects operations.  Deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect our earnings and cash flow.  Mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of our assets, lowering income and cash flow. Ice storms, tornadoes, or high winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities and require us to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses.  The expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process.Unplanned power plant outages may be costly.  Unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations.  As a result of unforeseen maintenance, we may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed our costs of generation.  Our financial performance may be negatively affected if we are unable to recover such increased costs.We rely on cash flows from subsidiaries.  DTE Energy is a holding company.  Cash flows from our utility and non-utility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on DTE Energy debt and securities.  Should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to DTE Energy, our ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted. 18Renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency programs may affect our business.  We are subject to existing Michigan and potential future federal legislation and regulation requiring us to secure sources of renewable energy.  We expect to comply with the existing state legislation, but we do not know what requirements may be added by federal legislation.  In addition, there could be additional state requirements increasing the percentage of power required to be provided by renewable energy sources.  We cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with complying with potential future legislation and regulations.  Compliance with these requirements can significantly increase capital expenditures and operating expenses and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates we charge to our customers.We are also required by Michigan legislation to implement energy efficiency measures and provide energy efficiency customer awareness and education programs.  These requirements necessitate expenditures and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing our revenues as customers decrease their energy usage.  We cannot predict how these programs will impact our business and future operating results.Regional and national economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on us.  Our utility and non-utility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers we serve and credit risk of counterparties we do business with.  Should national or regional economic conditions deteriorate, reduced volumes of electricity and gas, and demand for energy services we supply, collections of accounts receivable, reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding, and potentially higher levels of lost gas or stolen gas and electricity could result in decreased earnings and cash flow.Threats of terrorism or cyber attacks could affect our business.  We may be threatened by problems such as computer viruses or terrorism that may disrupt our operations and could harm our operating results.  Our industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure.  Despite our implementation of security measures, all of our technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism and other causes.  If our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we might be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.In addition, our generation plants, gas pipeline and storage facilities and electrical distribution facilities in particular may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy products.  We have increased security as a result of past events and we may be required by our regulators or by the future terrorist threat environment to make investments in security that we cannot currently predict.Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us.  In connection with our business we collect and retain personally identifiable information of our customers, shareholders and employees.  Our customers, shareholders and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information, and the United States regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding.  A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer, shareholder, employee or DTE Energy data by cybercrime or otherwise could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines and litigation.Failure to retain and attract key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on our operations.  Our business is dependent on our ability to recruit, retain, and motivate employees.  Competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to retain and attract these employees could adversely affect our business and future operating results. A work interruption may adversely affect us.  There are several bargaining units for the Company's approximately 4,900 represented employees.  The majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in 2016 and 2017.  A union choosing to strike would have an impact on our business.  We are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on our costs of operation and financial performance.If our goodwill becomes impaired, we may be required to record a charge to earnings.  We annually review the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions made by the Company for impairment.  Factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include any change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization, future cash flows, and slower growth rates in our industry.  We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery, worldwide or in the economy or markets in which we operate; however, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, the Company may take a non-cash impairment charge, which could potentially materially impact our results of operations and financial position. 19We may not be fully covered by insurance.  We have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks, including catastrophic damage as a result of acts of God, terrorism or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact our operations.  Economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance or our insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations"
3,DTE,DTE ENERGY CO,2012-02-16,"Risk Factors
There are various risks associated with the operations of DTE Energy's utility and non-utility businesses.  To provide a framework to understand the operating environment of DTE Energy, we are providing a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with our businesses.  Although we have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors, others could emerge in the future.  Each of the following risks could affect our performance.We are subject to rate regulation.  Electric and gas rates for our utilities are set by the MPSC and the FERC and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization.  We may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the MPSC, the FERC or other regulatory bodies.  Our ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers' rates.  Our regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers' rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under our governing laws and regulations.  Our utilities typically self-implement base rate changes six months after rate case filings in accordance with Michigan law.  However, if the final rates authorized by our regulators in the final rate order are lower than the amounts we collected during the self-implementation period, we must refund the difference with interest.  Our regulators may also disagree with our rate calculations under the various tracking and decoupling mechanisms that are intended to mitigate the risk to our utilities of certain aspects of our business.  If we cannot agree with our regulators on an appropriate reconciliation of those mechanisms, it may impact our ability to recover certain costs through our customer rates.  Our regulators may also decide to eliminate more of these mechanisms in future rate cases, which may make it more difficult for us to recover our costs in the rates we charge customers.  We cannot predict what rates an MPSC order will adopt in future rate cases. New legislation, regulations or interpretations could change how our business operates, impact our ability to recover costs through rates or require us to incur additional expenses.Changes to Michigan's electric Customer Choice program could negatively impact our financial performance.  The electric Customer Choice program, as originally contemplated in Michigan, anticipated an eventual transition to a totally deregulated and competitive environment where customers would be charged market-based rates for their electricity.  The State of Michigan currently experiences a hybrid market, where the MPSC continues to regulate electric rates for our customers, while alternative electric suppliers charge market-based rates.  In addition, such regulated electric rates for certain groups of our customers exceed the cost of service to those customers.  Due to distorted pricing mechanisms during the initial implementation period of electric Customer Choice, many commercial customers chose alternative electric suppliers.  MPSC rate orders and 2008 energy legislation enacted by the State of Michigan are phasing out the pricing disparity over five years and have placed a 10 percent cap on the total potential Customer Choice related migration.  However, even with the electric Customer Choice-related relief received in recent Detroit Edison rate orders and the legislated 10 percent cap on participation in the electric Customer Choice program, there continues to be legislative and financial risk associated with the electric Customer Choice program.  Electric Customer Choice migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes.Regional and national economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on us.  Our utility and non-utility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers we serve and credit risk of counterparties we do business with.  Our utilities and certain non-utility businesses provide services to the domestic automotive and steel industries which have undergone considerable financial distress, exacerbating the decline in regional economic conditions.  Should national or regional economic conditions deteriorate, reduced volumes of electricity and gas, and demand for energy services we supply, collections of accounts receivable, reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding, and potentially higher levels of lost or stolen gas could result in decreased earnings and cash flow.17Table of ContentsEnvironmental laws and liability may be costly.  We are subject to and affected by numerous environmental regulations.  These regulations govern air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharge and disposal of solid and hazardous waste.  Compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending, operating expenses and plant down times and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates we charge to our customers. Uncertainty around future environmental regulations creates difficulty planning long-term capital projects in our generation fleet and gas distribution businesses. These laws and regulations require us to seek a variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other regulatory approvals.  We could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities based on these regulations.  Additionally, we may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body.  We cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up costs.  There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties.We may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues.  Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil fuels.  If increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions are implemented, the operations of our fossil-fuel generation assets and our unconventional gas production assets may be significantly impacted.  Since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process, our financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters. Future environmental regulation of natural gas extraction techniques including hydraulic fracturing being discussed both at the United States federal level and by some states may affect the profitability of natural gas extraction businesses which could affect demand for and profitability of our gas transportation businesses. Operation of a nuclear facility subjects us to risk. Ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects us to significant additional risks.  These risks include, among others, plant security, environmental regulation and remediation, changes in federal nuclear regulation and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility.  While we maintain insurance for various nuclear-related risks, there can be no assurances that such insurance will be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at our nuclear generating plant, which may affect our financial performance.The supply and/or price of energy commodities and/or related services may impact our financial results.  We are dependent on coal for much of our electrical generating capacity.  Our access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for our utility gas customers.  Our non-utility businesses, including our energy transportation business, are also dependent upon supplies and prices of energy commodities and services.  Price fluctuations, fuel supply disruptions and changes in transportation costs could have a negative impact on the amounts we charge our utility customers for electricity and gas and on the profitability of our non-utility businesses.  We have hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms in place to mitigate some of the negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices in our utility and non-utility businesses, but there can be no assurances that our financial performance will not be negatively impacted by price fluctuations.  The price of energy also impacts the market for our non-utility businesses that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers or provide energy transportation services.The supply and/or price of other industrial raw and finished inputs and/or related services may impact our financial results.  We are dependent on supplies of certain commodities, such as copper and limestone, among others, and industrial materials and services in order to maintain day-to-day operations and maintenance of our facilities.  Price fluctuations or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items could have a negative impact on the amounts we charge our customers for our utility products and on the profitability of our non-utility businesses.Adverse changes in our credit ratings may negatively affect us.  Regional and national economic conditions, increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes, as well as changes in our economic performance, could result in credit agencies reexamining our credit rating.  While credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance, a downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade could restrict or discontinue our ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in our borrowing costs, a reduced level of capital expenditures and could impact future earnings and cash flows.  In addition, a reduction in our credit rating may require us to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energy-related commodities, products and services, which could impact our liquidity.Our ability to access capital markets is important.  Our ability to access capital markets is important to operate our businesses.  In the past, turmoil in credit markets has constrained, and may again in the future constrain, our ability as well as the ability of our subsidiaries to issue new debt, including commercial paper, and refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates.  In addition, the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit our access to capital 18Table of Contentsmarkets.  Our long term revolving credit facilities do not expire until 2015, but we regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects at our utilities, and we cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions. Poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan holdings and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact our liquidity and results of operations.  Our costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation, and our required or voluntary contributions made to the plans.  The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our plans.  We have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations.  These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below our projected return rates.  A decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future.  Additionally, our pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding requirements.  Also, if future increases in pension and postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from Detroit Edison or MichCon customers, the results of operations and financial position of our company could be negatively affected.  Without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of our plan assets, we could be required to fund our plans with significant amounts of cash.  Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on our cash flows, financial position, or results of operations.Construction and capital improvements to our power facilities and distribution systems subject us to risk. We are managing ongoing and planning future significant construction and capital improvement projects at multiple power generation and distribution facilities and our gas distribution system.  Many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond our control, including the cost of materials and labor, subcontractor performance, timing and issuance of necessary permits, construction disputes and weather conditions.  Failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect our financial performance and operations at the affected facilities and businesses.Our participation in energy trading markets subjects us to risk.  Events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole.  In certain situations we may be required to post collateral to support trading operations, which could be substantial.  If access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed, we could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows.  Energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose us to risks related to commodity price movements.  We routinely have speculative trading positions in the market, within strict policy guidelines we set, resulting from the management of our business portfolio.

We manage our exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures.  During periods of extreme volatility, these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities.Our non-utility businesses may not perform to our expectations.  We rely on our non-utility operations for a portion of our earnings.  If our current and contemplated non-utility investments do not perform at expected levels, we could experience diminished earnings and a corresponding decline in our shareholder value.Our estimates of gas reserves are subject to change.  While great care is exercised in utilizing historical information and assumptions to develop reasonable estimates of future production and cash flow, we cannot provide absolute assurance that our estimates of our Barnett gas reserves are accurate.  We estimate proved gas reserves and the future net cash flows attributable to those reserves.  There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved gas reserves and cash flows attributable to such reserves, including factors beyond our control.  Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner.  The accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves, or of cash flows attributable to such reserves, is a function of the available data, assumptions regarding expenditures for future development and exploration activities, and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment.  Additionally, reserves and future cash flows may be subject to material downward or upward revisions, based upon production history, development and exploration activities and prices of gas.  Actual future production, revenue, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses, quantities of recoverable reserves and the value of cash flows from such reserves may vary significantly from the assumptions and underlying information we used.Our ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited.  To reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil, the Internal Revenue Code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and electricity from alternative sources.  We generated production tax credits from coke production, landfill gas recovery, biomass fired electric generation, reduced emission fuel, renewable energy credits, steel industry fuel and gas production operations.  All production tax credits 19Table of Contentstaken after 2008 are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  If our production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an IRS audit, there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact our earnings and cash flows.Weather significantly affects operations.  Deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect our earnings and cash flow.  Mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of our assets, lowering income and cash flow. Ice storms, tornadoes, or high winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and require us to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses.  The expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process.Unplanned power plant outages may be costly.  Unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations.  As a result of unforeseen maintenance, we may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed our costs of generation.  Our financial performance may be negatively affected if we are unable to recover such increased costs.We rely on cash flows from subsidiaries.  DTE Energy is a holding company.  Cash flows from our utility and non-utility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on DTE Energy debt and securities.  Should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to DTE Energy, our ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted.Renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency programs may affect our business.  We are subject to existing Michigan and potential future federal legislation and regulation requiring us to secure sources of renewable energy.  Under the current Michigan legislation we will be required in the future to provide a specified percentage of our power from Michigan renewable energy sources.  We are developing a strategy for complying with the existing state legislation, but we do not know what requirements may be added by federal legislation. In addition, there could be additional state requirements increasing the percentage of power required to be provided by renewable energy sources.  We are actively engaged in developing renewable energy projects and identifying third party projects in which we can invest.  We cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with these future projects.We are also required by Michigan legislation to implement energy efficiency measures and provide energy efficiency customer awareness and education programs.  These requirements necessitate expenditures and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing our revenues as customers decrease their energy usage.  We do not know how these programs will impact our business and future operating results.Threats of terrorism or cyber attacks could affect our business.  We may be threatened by problems such as computer viruses or terrorism that may disrupt our operations and could harm our operating results.  Our industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure.  Despite our implementation of security measures, all of our technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism and other causes.  If our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we might be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.In addition, our generation plants, gas pipeline and storage facilities and electrical distribution facilities in particular may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy products.  We have increased security as a result of past events and we may be required by our regulators or by the future terrorist threat environment to make investments in security that we cannot currently predict.Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us.  In connection with our business we collect and retain personally identifiable information of our customers, shareholders and employees.  Our customers, shareholders and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information, and the United States regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding.  A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer, shareholder, employee or DTE Energy data by cybercrime or otherwise could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines and litigation.Failure to retain and attract key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on our operations.  Our business is dependent on our ability to recruit, retain, and motivate employees.  Competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to retain and attract these employees could adversely affect our business and future operating results. A work interruption may adversely affect us.  Unions represent approximately 5,000 of our employees.  Our contract with one union representing about 500 of our electrical linemen is due to expire in August 2012.  We cannot predict the outcome of those negotiations.  A union choosing to strike would have an impact on our business.  We are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on our costs of operation and financial performance.20Table of ContentsIf our goodwill becomes impaired, we may be required to record a charge to earnings.  We annually review the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions made by the Company for impairment.  Factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include any change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization, future cash flows, and slower growth rates in our industry.  We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery, worldwide or in the economy or markets in which we operate; however, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, the Company may take a non-cash impairment charge, which could potentially materially impact our results of operations and financial position.We may not be fully covered by insurance.  We have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks, including catastrophic damage as a result of acts of God, terrorism or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact our operations.

8,DTE,DTE ENERGY CO,2011-02-18,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors     There are various risks associated with the operations of DTE    Energys utility and non-utility businesses. To provide a    framework to understand the operating environment of DTE Energy,    we are providing a brief explanation of the more significant    risks associated with our businesses. Although we have tried to    identify and discuss key risk factors, others could emerge in    the future. Each of the following risks could affect our    performance. Regional and national economic conditions can have an    unfavorable impact on us.  Our utility and    non-utility businesses follow the economic cycles of the    customers we serve. Our utilities and certain non-utility    businesses provide services to the domestic automotive and steel    industries which have undergone considerable financial distress,    exacerbating the decline in regional economic conditions. Should    national or regional economic conditions further decline,    reduced volumes of electricity and gas, and demand for energy    services we supply, collections of accounts receivable and    potentially higher levels of lost or stolen gas could result in    decreased earnings and cash flow. We are exposed to credit risk of counterparties with whom we    do business.  Adverse economic conditions    affecting, or financial difficulties of, counterparties with    whom we do business could impair the ability of these    counterparties to pay for our services or fulfill their    contractual obligations, or cause them to delay such payments or    obligations. We depend on these counterparties to remit payments    on a timely basis. Any delay or default in payment could    adversely affect our cash flows, financial position, or results    of operations. We are subject to rate regulation.  Electric    and gas rates for our utilities are set by the MPSC and the FERC    and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization. We may    be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by    the MPSC, the FERC or other regulatory bodies. Our ability to    recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the    incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in    customers rates. Our regulators also may decide to    disallow recovery of certain costs in customers rates if    they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for    recovery under our governing laws and regulations. The State of    Michigan elected a new governor and legislature in November 2010    and we cannot predict whether the resulting changes in political    conditions will affect the regulations or interpretations    affecting our utilities. New legislation, regulations or    interpretations could change how our business operates, impact    our ability to recover costs through rate increases or require    us to incur additional expenses. We may be required to refund amounts we collect under    self-implemented rates.  Michigan law allows our    utilities to self-implement base rate changes six months after a    rate filing, subject to certain limitations. However, if the    final rate case order provides for lower rates than we have    self-implemented, we must refund the difference, with interest.    We have self-implemented rates in the past and have been ordered    to make refunds to customers. Our financial performance may be    negatively affected if the MPSC sets lower rates in future rate    cases than those we have self-implemented, thereby requiring us    to issue refunds. We cannot predict what rates an MPSC order    will adopt in future rate cases. Michigans electric Customer Choice program could    negatively impact our financial performance.  The    electric Customer Choice program, as originally contemplated in    Michigan, anticipated an eventual transition to a totally    deregulated and competitive environment where customers would be    charged market-based rates for their electricity. The State of    Michigan currently experiences a hybrid market, where the MPSC    continues to regulate electric rates for our customers, while    alternative electric suppliers charge market-based rates. In    addition, such regulated electric rates for certain groups of    our customers exceed the cost of service to those customers. Due    to distorted pricing mechanisms during the initial    implementation period of electric Customer Choice, many    commercial customers chose alternative electric suppliers. MPSC    rate orders and 2008 energy legislation enacted by the State of    Michigan are phasing out the pricing disparity over five years    and have placed a cap on the total    21Table of Contents    potential Customer Choice related migration. However, even with    the electric Customer Choice-related relief received in recent    Detroit Edison rate orders and the legislated 10 percent    cap on participation in the electric Customer Choice program,    there continues to be financial risk associated with the    electric Customer Choice program. Electric Customer Choice    migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric    price changes. Environmental laws and liability may be    costly.  We are subject to numerous environmental    regulations. These regulations govern air emissions, water    quality, wastewater discharge and disposal of solid and    hazardous waste. Compliance with these regulations can    significantly increase capital spending, operating expenses and    plant down times. These laws and regulations require us to seek    a variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and    other regulatory approvals. We could be required to install    expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease    activities based on these regulations. Additionally, we may    become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites    identified by a regulatory body. We cannot predict with    certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related    to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating    clean up costs. There is also uncertainty in quantifying    liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and    several liability on potentially responsible parties.     We may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future    requirements to address climate change issues. Proposals for    voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed    both in the United States and worldwide to reduce greenhouse    gases such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil    fuels. If increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions are    implemented, the operations of our fossil-fuel generation assets    and our unconventional gas production assets may be    significantly impacted. Since there can be no assurances that    environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory    process, our financial performance may be negatively impacted as    a result of environmental matters. Adverse changes in our credit ratings may negatively affect    us.  Regional and national economic    conditions, increased scrutiny of the energy industry and    regulatory changes, as well as changes in our economic    performance, could result in credit agencies reexamining our    credit rating. While credit ratings reflect the opinions of the    credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily    reflect actual performance, a downgrade in our credit rating    below investment grade could restrict or discontinue our ability    to access capital markets and could result in an increase in our    borrowing costs, a reduced level of capital expenditures and    could impact future earnings and cash flows. In addition, a    reduction in credit rating may require us to post collateral    related to various physical or financially settled contracts for    the purchase of energy-related commodities, products and    services, which could impact our liquidity. Our ability to access capital markets is    important.  Our ability to access capital markets    is important to operate our businesses. In the past, turmoil in    credit markets has constrained, and may again in the future    constrain, our ability as well as the ability of our    subsidiaries to issue new debt, including commercial paper, and    refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates. In    addition, the level of borrowing by other energy companies and    the market as a whole could limit our access to capital markets.    We have substantial amounts of credit facilities that expire in    2012 and 2013. We intend to seek to renew the facilities on or    before the expiration dates. However, we cannot predict the    outcome of these efforts, which could result in a decrease in    amounts available    and/or an    increase in our borrowing costs and negatively impact our    financial performance. Poor investment performance of pension and other    postretirement benefit plan holdings and other factors impacting    benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact our liquidity and    results of operations.  Our costs of providing    non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and other    postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of    factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, the level    of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding    levels of the plans, future government regulation, and our    required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. The    performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of    assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations    under our plans. We have significant benefit obligations and    hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations.    These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield    uncertain returns, which may fall below our projected return    rates. A decline in the market value of the pension and    postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding    requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans    if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the    foreseeable future. Additionally, our pension and postretirement    benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest    rates. As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase,    22Table of Contents    potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements.    Also, if future increases in pension and postretirement benefit    costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable    from Detroit Edison or MichCon customers, the results of    operations and financial position of our company could be    negatively affected. Without sustained growth in the plan    investments over time to increase the value of our plan assets,    we could be required to fund our plans with significant amounts    of cash. Such cash funding obligations could have a material    impact on our cash flows, financial position, or results of    operations. If our goodwill becomes impaired, we may be required to    record a charge to earnings.  We annually review    the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions made    by the Company for impairment. Factors that may be considered    for purposes of this analysis include any change in    circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill    may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and    market capitalization, future cash flows, and slower growth    rates in our industry. We cannot predict the timing, strength or    duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery,    worldwide or in the economy or markets in which we operate;    however, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that    the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, the    Company may take a non-cash impairment charge, which could    potentially materially impact our results of operations and    financial position. Weather significantly affects    operations.  Deviations from normal hot and cold    weather conditions affect our earnings and cash flow. Mild    temperatures can result in decreased utilization of our assets,    lowering income and cash flow. Ice storms, tornadoes, or high    winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure    and require us to perform emergency repairs and incur material    unplanned expenses. The expenses of storm restoration efforts    may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process. Operation of a nuclear facility subjects us to    risk.  Ownership of an operating nuclear    generating plant subjects us to significant additional risks.    These risks include, among others, plant security, environmental    regulation and remediation, and operational factors that can    significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a    nuclear facility. While we maintain insurance for various    nuclear-related risks, there can be no assurances that such    insurance will be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of    an accident or business interruption at our nuclear generating    plant, which may affect our financial performance. Construction and capital improvements to our power facilities    subject us to risk.  We are managing ongoing and    planning future significant construction and capital improvement    projects at multiple power generation and distribution    facilities. Many factors that could cause delay or increased    prices for these complex projects are beyond our control,    including the cost of materials and labor, subcontractor    performance, timing and issuance of necessary permits,    construction disputes and weather conditions. Failure to    complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason    could adversely affect our financial performance and operations    at the affected facilities. The supply    and/or price    of energy commodities    and/or    related services may impact our financial    results.  We are dependent on coal for much of our    electrical generating capacity. Price fluctuations, fuel supply    disruptions and increases in transportation costs could have a    negative impact on the amounts we charge our utility customers    for electricity and on the profitability of our non-utility    businesses. Our access to natural gas supplies is critical to    ensure reliability of service for our utility gas customers. We    have hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms in    place to mitigate negative fluctuations in commodity supply    prices, but there can be no assurances that our financial    performance will not be negatively impacted by price    fluctuations. The price of energy also impacts the market for    our non-utility businesses that compete with utilities and    alternative electric suppliers. The supply    and/or price    of other industrial raw and finished inputs    and/or    related services may impact our financial    results.  We are dependent on supplies of certain    commodities, such as copper and limestone, among others, and    industrial materials and services in order to maintain    day-to-day    operations and maintenance of our facilities. Price fluctuations    or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items    could have a negative impact on the amounts we charge our    customers for our utility products and on the profitability of    our non-utility businesses. Unplanned power plant outages may be    costly.  Unforeseen maintenance may be required to    safely produce electricity or comply with environmental    regulations. As a result of unforeseen maintenance, we may be    required to    23Table of Contents    make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed our costs    of generation. Our financial performance may be negatively    affected if we are unable to recover such increased costs. Our estimates of gas reserves are subject to    change.  While great care is exercised in    utilizing historical information and assumptions to develop    reasonable estimates of future production and cash flow, we    cannot provide absolute assurance that our estimates of our    Barnett gas reserves are accurate. We estimate proved gas    reserves and the future net cash flows attributable to those    reserves. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in    estimating quantities of proved gas reserves and cash flows    attributable to such reserves, including factors beyond our    control. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of    estimating underground accumulations of gas that cannot be    measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of an estimate of    quantities of reserves, or of cash flows attributable to such    reserves, is a function of the available data, assumptions    regarding expenditures for future development and exploration    activities, and of engineering and geological interpretation and    judgment. Additionally, reserves and future cash flows may be    subject to material downward or upward revisions, based upon    production history, development and exploration activities and    prices of gas. Actual future production, revenue, taxes,    development expenditures, operating expenses, quantities of    recoverable reserves and the value of cash flows from such    reserves may vary significantly from the assumptions and    underlying information we used. Our ability to utilize production tax credits may be    limited.  To reduce U.S. dependence on    imported oil, the Internal Revenue Code provides production tax    credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and    electricity from alternative sources. We have generated    production tax credits from coke production, landfill gas    recovery; biomass fired electric generation, reduced emission    fuel, steel industry fuel and gas production operations. All    production tax credits taken after 2008 are subject to audit by    the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If our production tax    credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an    IRS audit, there could be additional tax liabilities owed for    previously recognized tax credits that could significantly    impact our earnings and cash flows. We rely on cash flows from subsidiaries.  DTE    Energy is a holding company. Cash flows from our utility and    non-utility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses    and dividends on DTE Energy debt and securities. Should a major    subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows    to DTE Energy, our ability to pay interest and dividends would    be restricted. Renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency programs    may affect our business.  We are subject to    Michigan and potential future federal legislation and regulation    requiring us to secure sources of renewable energy. Under the    current Michigan legislation we will be required in the future    to provide a specified percentage of our power from Michigan    renewable energy sources. We are developing a strategy for    complying with the existing state legislation, but we do not    know what requirements may be added by federal legislation. We    are actively engaged in developing renewable energy projects and    identifying third party projects in which we can invest. We    cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with    these future projects.     We are also required by Michigan legislation to implement energy    efficiency measures and provide energy efficiency customer    awareness and education programs. These requirements necessitate    expenditures and implementation of these programs creates the    risk of reducing our revenues as customers decrease their energy    usage. We do not know how these programs will impact our    business and future operating results. Threats of terrorism or cyber attacks could affect our    business.  We may be threatened by problems such    as computer viruses or terrorism that may disrupt our operations    and could harm our operating results. Our industry requires the    continued operation of sophisticated information technology    systems and network infrastructure. Despite our implementation    of security measures, all of our technology systems are    vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses,    acts of war or terrorism and other causes. If our information    technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in    a timely way, we might be unable to fulfill critical business    functions, which could have a material adverse effect on our    business, operating results, and financial condition.     In addition, our generation plants, gas pipeline and storage    facilities and electrical distribution facilities in particular    may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our    ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy    products. We have increased security as a result of past events    and we may be required by our regulators or by the future    terrorist threat environment to make investments in security    that we cannot currently predict.    24Table of ContentsOur participation in energy trading markets subjects us to    risk.  Events in the energy trading industry have    increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business    and the energy industry as a whole. In certain situations we may    be required to post collateral to support trading operations,    which could be substantial. If access to liquidity to support    trading activities is curtailed, we could experience decreased    earnings potential and cash flows. Energy trading activities    take place in volatile markets and expose us to risks related to    commodity price movements. We routinely have speculative trading    positions in the market, within strict policy guidelines we set,    resulting from the management of our business portfolio. To the    extent speculative trading positions exist, fluctuating    commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results    and financial position. We manage our exposure by establishing    and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures.    During periods of extreme volatility, these risk limits and risk    management procedures may not work as planned and cannot    eliminate all risks associated with these activities. We may not be fully covered by insurance.  We    have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide    coverage for various types of risks, including catastrophic    damage as a result of acts of God, terrorism or a combination of    other significant unforeseen events that could impact our    operations. Economic losses might not be covered in full by    insurance or our insurers may be unable to meet contractual    obligations. Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable    information could adversely affect us.  In    connection with our business we collect and retain personally    identifiable information of our customers, shareholders and    employees. Our customers, shareholders and employees expect that    we will adequately protect their personal information, and the    United States regulatory environment surrounding information    security and privacy is increasingly demanding. A significant    theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer, shareholder, employee    or DTE Energy data by cybercrime or otherwise could adversely    impact our reputation and could result in significant costs,    fines and litigation. A work interruption may adversely affect    us.  Unions represent approximately 5,000 of our    employees. A union choosing to strike would have an impact on    our business. We are unable to predict the effect a work    stoppage would have on our costs of operation and financial    performance. Failure to retain and attract key executive officers and    other skilled professional and technical employees could have an    adverse effect on our operations.  Our business is    dependent on our ability to recruit, retain, and motivate    employees. Competition for skilled employees in some areas is    high and the inability to retain and attract these employees    could adversely affect our business and future operating results. "
16,DTE,DTE ENERGY CO,2010-02-23,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors     There are various risks associated with the operations of DTE    Energys utility and non-utility businesses. To provide a    framework to understand the operating environment of DTE Energy,    we are providing a brief explanation of the more significant    risks associated with our businesses. Although we have tried to    identify and discuss key risk factors, others could emerge in    the future. Each of the following risks could affect our    performance. Regional and national economic conditions can have an    unfavorable impact on us.  Our utility and    non-utility businesses follow the economic cycles of the    customers we serve. Our utilities and certain non-utility    businesses provide services to the domestic automotive and steel    industries which have undergone considerable financial distress,    exacerbating the decline in regional economic conditions. Should    national or regional economic conditions further decline,    reduced volumes of electricity and gas, and demand for energy    services we supply, collections of accounts receivable and    potentially higher levels of lost or stolen gas will result in    decreased earnings and cash flow. Adverse changes in our credit ratings may negatively affect    us.  Regional and national economic    conditions, increased scrutiny of the energy industry and    regulatory changes, as well as changes in our economic    performance, could result in credit agencies reexamining our    credit rating. While credit ratings reflect the opinions of the    credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily    reflect actual performance, a downgrade in our credit rating    below investment grade could restrict or discontinue our ability    to access capital markets and could result in an increase in our    borrowing costs, a reduced level of capital expenditures and    could impact future earnings and cash flows. In addition, a    reduction in credit rating may    21Table of Contents    require us to post collateral related to various physical or    financially settled contracts for the purchase of energy-related    commodities, products and services, which could impact our    liquidity. Our ability to access capital markets is    important.  Our ability to access capital markets    is important to operate our businesses. In the past, turmoil in    credit markets has constrained, and may again in the future    constrain, our ability as well as the ability of our    subsidiaries to issue new debt, including commercial paper, and    refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates. In    addition, the level of borrowing by other energy companies and    the market as a whole could limit our access to capital markets.    We have substantial amounts of credit facilities that expire in    2010. We intend to seek to renew the facilities on or before the    expiration dates. However, we cannot predict the outcome of    these efforts, which could result in a decrease in amounts    available    and/or an    increase in our borrowing costs and negatively impact our    financial performance. Poor investment performance of pension and other    postretirement benefit plan holdings and other factors impacting    benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact our liquidity and    results of operations.  Our costs of providing    non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and other    postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of    factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, the level    of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding    levels of the plans, future government regulation, and our    required or voluntary contributions made to the plans.

We have significant benefit obligations and    hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations.    These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield    uncertain returns, which may fall below our projected return    rates. A decline in the market value of the pension and    postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding    requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans    if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the    foreseeable future. Additionally, our pension and postretirement    benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest    rates. As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase,    potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements.    Also, if future increases in pension and postretirement benefit    costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable    from Detroit Edison or MichCon customers, the results of    operations and financial position of our company could be    negatively affected. Without sustained growth in the plan    investments over time to increase the value of our plan assets,    we could be required to fund our plans with significant amounts    of cash. Such cash funding obligations could have a material    impact on our cash flows, financial position, or results of    operations. If our goodwill becomes impaired, we may be required to    record a charge to earnings.  We annually review    the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions made    by the Company for impairment. Factors that may be considered    for purposes of this analysis include any change in    circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill    may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and    market capitalization, future cash flows, and slower growth    rates in our industry. We cannot predict the timing, strength or    duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery,    worldwide or in the economy or markets in which we operate,    however, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that    the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, the    Company may take a non-cash impairment charge, which could    potentially materially impact our results of operations and    financial position. Our participation in energy trading markets subjects us to    risk.  Events in the energy trading industry have    increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business    and the energy industry as a whole. In certain situations we may    be required to post collateral to support trading operations,    which could be substantial.

Energy trading activities    take place in volatile markets and expose us to risks related to    commodity price movements. We routinely have speculative trading    positions in the market, within strict policy guidelines we set,    resulting from the management of our business portfolio. To the    extent speculative trading positions exist, fluctuating    commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results    and financial position. We manage our exposure by establishing    and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures.    During periods of extreme volatility, these risk limits and risk    management procedures may not work as planned and cannot    eliminate all risks associated with these activities. As a    result, we cannot predict the impact that our energy trading and    risk management decisions may have on our business, operating    results or financial position.    22Table of ContentsWe are exposed to credit risk of counterparties with whom we    do business.  Adverse economic conditions    affecting, or financial difficulties of, counterparties with    whom we do business could impair the ability of these    counterparties to pay for our services or fulfill their    contractual obligations, or cause them to delay such payments or    obligations. We depend on these counterparties to remit payments    on a timely basis. Any delay or default in payment could    adversely affect our cash flows, financial position, or results    of operations. We are subject to rate regulation.  Electric    and gas rates for our utilities are set by the MPSC and the FERC    and cannot be increased without regulatory authorization. We may    be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by    the MPSC, the FERC or other regulatory bodies. Our ability to    recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the    incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in    customers rates. Our regulators also may decide to    disallow recovery of certain costs in customers rates if    they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for    recovery under our governing laws and regulations. The State of    Michigan will elect a new governor and legislature in 2010 and    we cannot predict the outcome of that election. We cannot    predict whether election results or changes in political    conditions will affect the regulations or interpretations    affecting our utilities. New legislation, regulations or    interpretations could change how our business operates, impact    our ability to recover costs through rate increases or require    us to incur additional expenses. We may be required to refund amounts we collect under    self-implemented rates.  Michigan law allows our    utilities to self-implement rate changes six months after a rate    filing, subject to certain limitations. However, if the final    rate case order provides for lower rates than we have    self-implemented, we must refund the difference, with interest.    We have self-implemented rates in the past and have been ordered    to make refunds to customers. Our financial performance may be    negatively affected if the MPSC sets lower rates in future rate    cases than those we have self-implemented, thereby requiring us    to issue refunds. We cannot predict what rates an MPSC order    will adopt in future rate cases. Michigans electric Customer Choice program could    negatively impact our financial performance.  The    electric Customer Choice program, as originally contemplated in    Michigan, anticipated an eventual transition to a totally    deregulated and competitive environment where customers would be    charged market-based rates for their electricity. The State of    Michigan currently experiences a hybrid market, where the MPSC    continues to regulate electric rates for our customers, while    alternative electric suppliers charge market-based rates. In    addition, such regulated electric rates for certain groups of    our customers exceed the cost of service to those customers. Due    to distorted pricing mechanisms during the initial    implementation period of electric Customer Choice, many    commercial customers chose alternative electric suppliers. MPSC    rate orders and recent energy legislation enacted by the State    of Michigan are phasing out the pricing disparity over five    years and have placed a cap on the total potential Customer    Choice related migration. However, even with the electric    Customer Choice-related relief received in recent Detroit Edison    rate orders and the legislated 10 percent cap on    participation in the electric Customer Choice program, there    continues to be financial risk associated with the electric    Customer Choice program. Electric Customer Choice migration is    sensitive to market price and bundled electric service price    increases. Weather significantly affects    operations.  Deviations from normal hot and cold    weather conditions affect our earnings and cash flow. Mild    temperatures can result in decreased utilization of our assets,    lowering income and cash flow. Ice storms, tornadoes, or high    winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure    and require us to perform emergency repairs and incur material    unplanned expenses. The expenses of storm restoration efforts    may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process. Operation of a nuclear facility subjects us to    risk.  Ownership of an operating nuclear    generating plant subjects us to significant additional risks.    These risks include, among others, plant security, environmental    regulation and remediation, and operational factors that can    significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a    nuclear facility. While we maintain insurance for various    nuclear-related risks, there can be no assurances that such    insurance will be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of    an accident or business interruption at our nuclear generating    plant, which may affect our financial performance. Construction and capital improvements to our power facilities    subject us to risk.  We are managing ongoing and    planning future significant construction and capital improvement    projects at multiple power    23Table of Contents    generation and distribution facilities. Many factors that could    cause delay or increased prices for these complex projects are    beyond our control, including the cost of materials and labor,    subcontractor performance, timing and issuance of necessary    permits, construction disputes and weather conditions. Failure    to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any    reason could adversely affect our financial performance and    operations at the affected facilities. The supply    and/or price    of energy commodities    and/or    related services may impact our financial    results.  We are dependent on coal for much of our    electrical generating capacity. Price fluctuations, fuel supply    disruptions and increases in transportation costs could have a    negative impact on the amounts we charge our utility customers    for electricity and on the profitability of our non-utility    business. Our access to natural gas supplies is critical to    ensure reliability of service for our utility gas customers. We    have hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms in    place to mitigate negative fluctuations in commodity supply    prices, but there can be no assurances that our financial    performance will not be negatively impacted by price    fluctuations. The price of natural gas also impacts the market    for our non-utility businesses that compete with utilities and    alternative electric suppliers. The supply    and/or price    other industrial raw and finished inputs    and/or    related services may impact our financial    results.  We are dependent on supplies of certain    commodities, such as copper and limestone, among others, and    industrial materials and services in order to maintain    day-to-day    operations and maintenance of our facilities. Price fluctuations    or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items    could have a negative impact on the amounts we charge our    customers for our utility products and on the profitability of    our non-utility businesses. Unplanned power plant outages may be    costly.  Unforeseen maintenance may be required to    safely produce electricity or comply with environmental    regulations. As a result of unforeseen maintenance, we may be    required to make spot market purchases of electricity that    exceed our costs of generation. Our financial performance may be    negatively affected if we are unable to recover such increased    costs. Our estimates of gas reserves are subject to    change.  While we cannot provide absolute    assurance that our estimates of our Barnett gas reserves are    accurate, great care is exercised in utilizing historical    information and assumptions to develop reasonable estimates of    future production and cash flow. We estimate proved gas reserves    and the future net cash flows attributable to those reserves.    There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating    quantities of proved gas reserves and cash flows attributable to    such reserves, including factors beyond our control. Reserve    engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground    accumulations of gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner.    The accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves, or of    cash flows attributable to such reserves, is a function of the    available data, assumptions regarding expenditures for future    development and exploration activities, and of engineering and    geological interpretation and judgment. Additionally, reserves    and future cash flows may be subject to material downward or    upward revisions, based upon production history, development and    exploration activities and prices of gas. Actual future    production, revenue, taxes, development expenditures, operating    expenses, quantities of recoverable reserves and the value of    cash flows from such reserves may vary significantly from the    assumptions and underlying information we used. Our ability to utilize production tax credits may be    limited.  To reduce U.S. dependence on    imported oil, the Internal Revenue Code provides production tax    credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and    electricity from alternative sources. We have generated    production tax credits from synfuel, coke production, landfill    gas recovery, biomass fired electric generation, reduced    emission fuel, steel industry fuel and gas production    operations. We have received favorable private letter rulings on    all of the synfuel facilities. All production tax credits taken    after 2006 are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service    (IRS). If our production tax credits were disallowed in whole or    in part as a result of an IRS audit, there could be additional    tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that    could significantly impact our earnings and cash flows. We have    also provided certain guarantees and indemnities in conjunction    with the sales of interests in the synfuel facilities. We rely on cash flows from subsidiaries.  DTE    Energy is a holding company. Cash flows from our utility and    non-utility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses    and dividends on DTE Energy debt and    24Table of Contents    securities. Should a major subsidiary not be able to pay    dividends or transfer cash flows to DTE Energy, our ability to    pay interest and dividends would be restricted. Environmental laws and liability may be    costly.  We are subject to numerous environmental    regulations. These regulations govern air emissions, water    quality, wastewater discharge and disposal of solid and    hazardous waste. Compliance with these regulations can    significantly increase capital spending, operating expenses and    plant down times. These laws and regulations require us to seek    a variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and    other regulatory approvals. We could be required to install    expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease    activities based on these regulations. Additionally, we may    become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites    identified by a regulatory body. We cannot predict with    certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related    to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating    clean up costs. There is also uncertainty in quantifying    liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and    several liability on potentially responsible parties.     We may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future    requirements to address climate change issues. Proposals for    voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed    both in the United States and worldwide to reduce greenhouse    gases such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil    fuels. If increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions are    implemented, the operations of our fossil-fuel generation assets    and our unconventional gas production assets may be    significantly impacted. Since there can be no assurances that    environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory    process, our financial performance may be negatively impacted as    a result of environmental matters. Renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency programs    may affect our business.  We are subject to    Michigan and potential future federal legislation and regulation    requiring us to secure sources of renewable energy. Under the    current Michigan legislation we will be required in the future    to provide a specified percentage of our power from Michigan    renewable energy sources. We are developing a strategy for    complying with the existing state legislation, but we do not    know what requirements may be added by federal legislation. We    are actively engaged in developing renewable energy projects and    identifying third party projects in which we can invest. We    cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with    these future projects.     We are also required by Michigan legislation to implement energy    efficiency measures and provide energy efficiency customer    awareness and education programs. These requirements necessitate    expenditures and implementation of these programs creates the    risk of reducing our revenues as customers decrease their energy    usage. We do not know how these programs will impact our    business and future operating results. Threats of terrorism or cyber attacks could affect our    business.  We may be threatened by problems such    as computer viruses or terrorism that may disrupt our operations    and could harm our operating results. Our industry requires the    continued operation of sophisticated information technology    systems and network infrastructure. Despite our implementation    of security measures, all of our technology systems are    vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses,    acts of war or terrorism and other causes. If our information    technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in    a timely way, we might be unable to fulfill critical business    functions, which could have a material adverse effect on our    business, operating results, and financial condition.     In addition, our generation plants, gas pipeline and storage    facilities and electrical distribution facilities in particular    may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our    ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy    products. We have increased security as a result of past events    and we may be required by our regulators or by the future    terrorist threat environment to make investments in security    that we cannot currently predict. We may not be fully covered by insurance.  We    have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide    coverage for various types of risks, including catastrophic    damage as a result of acts of God, terrorism or a combination of    other significant unforeseen events that could impact our    operations. Economic losses might not be covered in full by    insurance or our insurers may be unable to meet contractual    obligations. Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable    information could adversely affect us.  In    connection with our business we collect and retain personally    identifiable information of our customers,    25Table of Contents    shareholders and employees. Our customers, shareholders and    employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal    information, and the United States regulatory environment    surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly    demanding. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of    customer, shareholder, employee or DTE Energy data by cybercrime    or otherwise could adversely impact our reputation and could    result in significant costs, fines and litigation. Benefits of continuous improvement initiatives could be less    than we expect.  We have a continuous improvement    program that is expected to result in significant cost savings.    Actual results achieved through this program could be less than    our expectations. A work interruption may adversely affect    us.  Unions represent approximately 5,000 of our    employees. A union choosing to strike would have an impact on    our business. Contracts with several of our unions, including    our contract with our largest union, representing about 3,800 of    our employees, expire on different dates throughout 2010. In    addition, our contracts with unions representing two small    groups of employees expired on December 31, 2009 and    another union is currently negotiating its first contract. We    cannot predict the outcome of any of these contract    negotiations, some of which have not yet commenced. We are    unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on our    costs of operation and financial performance. Failure to retain and attract key executive officers and    other skilled professional and technical employees could have an    adverse effect on our operations.  Our business is    dependent on our ability to recruit, retain, and motivate    employees. Competition for skilled employees in some areas is    high and the inability to retain and attract these employees    could adversely affect our business and future operating results. "
10,DTE,DTE ENERGY CO,2009-02-27,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors     There are various risks associated with the operations of DTE    Energys utility and non-utility businesses. To provide a    framework to understand the operating environment of DTE Energy,    we are providing a brief explanation of the more significant    risks associated with our businesses. Although we have tried to    identify and discuss key risk factors, others could emerge in    the future. Each of the following risks could affect our    performance. Regional and national economic conditions can have an    unfavorable impact on us.  Our utility and    non-utility businesses follow the economic cycles of the    customers we serve. Our utilities and certain non-utility    businesses provide services to the domestic automotive industry    which is under considerable financial distress, exacerbating the    decline in regional economic conditions. Should national or    regional economic conditions further decline, reduced volumes of    electricity and gas, and demand for energy services we supply,    collections of accounts receivable and potentially higher levels    of lost or stolen gas will result in decreased earnings and cash    flow. Adverse changes in our credit ratings may negatively affect    us.  Regional and national economic    conditions, increased scrutiny of the energy industry and    regulatory changes, as well as changes in our economic    performance, could result in credit agencies reexamining our    credit rating. While credit ratings reflect the opinions of the    credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily    reflect actual performance, a downgrade in our credit rating    could restrict or discontinue our ability to access capital    markets and could result in an increase in our borrowing costs,    a reduced level of capital expenditures and could impact future    earnings and cash flows. In addition, a reduction in credit    rating may require us to post collateral related to various    physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of    energy-related commodities, products and services, which would    impact our liquidity. Our ability to access capital markets at attractive interest    rates is important.  Our ability to access capital    markets is important to operate our businesses. In recent    months, the global financial markets have experienced    unprecedented instability. This systemic marketplace distress is    impacting our access to capital and cost of capital. This recent    turmoil in credit markets has constrained, and may again in the    future constrain, our ability as well as the ability of our    subsidiaries to issue new debt, including commercial paper, and    refinance existing debt. We cannot predict the length of time    the current worldwide credit situation will continue or the    impact on our future operations and our ability to issue debt at    reasonable interest rates. In addition, the level of borrowing    by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit    our access to capital markets. We have substantial amounts of    short-term credit facilities that expire in 2009. We intend to    seek to renew the facilities on or before the expiration dates.    However, we cannot predict the outcome of these efforts, which    could result in a decrease in amounts available and/ or an    increase in our borrowing costs and negatively impact our    financial performance. Poor investment performance of pension and other    postretirement benefit plan holdings and other factors impacting    benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact our liquidity and    results of operations.  Our costs of providing    non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and other    postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of    factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, the level    of interest rates used to measure    22Table of Contents    the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future    government regulation, and our required or voluntary    contributions made to the plans. The performance of the capital    markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to    satisfy future obligations under our plans. We have significant    benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to    satisfy these obligations. These assets are subject to market    fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall    below our projected return rates. A decline in the market value    of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets, as was    experienced in 2008, will increase the funding requirements    under our pension and postretirement benefit plans if the actual    asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable    future. Additionally, our pension and postretirement benefit    plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As    interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially    increasing benefit expense and funding requirements. Also, if    future increases in pension and postretirement benefit costs as    a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from Detroit    Edison or MichCon customers, the results of operations and    financial position of our company could be negatively affected.    Without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to    increase the value of our plan assets, we could be required to    fund our plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash    funding obligations could have a material impact on our cash    flows, financial position, or results of operations. If our goodwill becomes impaired, we may be required to    record a charge to earnings.  We annually review    the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions made    by the Company for impairment. Factors that may be considered    for purposes of this analysis include any change in    circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill    may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and    market capitalization, future cash flows, and slower growth    rates in our industry. We cannot predict the timing, strength or    duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery,    worldwide or in the economy or markets in which we operate,    however, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that    the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, the    Company may take a non-cash impairment charge, which could    potentially materially impact our results of operations and    financial position. Our participation in energy trading markets subjects us to    risk.  Events in the energy trading industry have    increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business    and the energy industry as a whole. In certain situations we may    be required to post collateral to support trading operations,    which could be substantial. If access to liquidity to support    trading activities is curtailed, we could experience decreased    earnings potential and cash flows. We are exposed to credit risk of counterparties with whom we    do business.  Adverse economic conditions    affecting, or financial difficulties of, counterparties with    whom we do business could impair the ability of these    counterparties to pay for our services or fulfill their    contractual obligations, or cause them to delay such payments or    obligations. We depend on these counterparties to remit payments    on a timely basis. Any delay or default in payment could    adversely affect our cash flows, financial position, or results    of operations. We may not be fully covered by insurance.  We    have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide    coverage for various types of risks, catastrophic damage as a    result of acts of God, terrorism, war or a combination of other    significant unforeseen events that could impact our operations.    Economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance or our    insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations. We are subject to rate regulation.  Electric    and gas rates for our utilities are set by the MPSC and the FERC    and cannot be increased without regulatory authorization. We may    be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by    the MPSC, the FERC or other regulatory bodies. Our ability to    recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the    incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in    customers rates. New legislation, regulations or    interpretations could change how our business operates, impact    our ability to recover costs through rate increases or require    us to incur additional expenses. Michigans electric Customer Choice program could    negatively impact our financial performance.  The    electric Customer Choice program, as originally contemplated in    Michigan, anticipated an eventual transition to a totally    deregulated and competitive environment where customers would be    charged market-based rates for their electricity. The State of    Michigan currently experiences a hybrid market, where the MPSC    continues to regulate electric rates for our customers, while    alternative electric suppliers charge market-based rates. In    addition, such regulated electric rates for certain groups of    our customers exceed the cost of service to those    23Table of Contents    customers. Due to distorted pricing mechanisms during the    initial implementation period of electric Customer Choice, many    commercial customers chose alternative electric suppliers. MPSC    rate orders and recent energy legislation enacted by the State    of Michigan are phasing out the pricing disparity over five    years and have placed a cap on the total potential Customer    Choice related migration. Recent higher wholesale electric    prices have also resulted in some former electric Customer    Choice customers migrating back to Detroit Edison for electric    generation service. However, even with the electric Customer    Choice-related relief received in recent Detroit Edison rate    orders and the legislated 10 percent cap on participation    in the electric Customer Choice program, there continues to be    financial risk associated with the electric Customer Choice    program. Electric Customer Choice migration is sensitive to    market price and bundled electric service price increases. Weather significantly affects    operations.  Deviations from normal hot and cold    weather conditions affect our earnings and cash flow. Mild    temperatures can result in decreased utilization of our assets,    lowering income and cash flow. Ice storms, tornadoes, or high    winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure    and require us to perform emergency repairs and incur material    unplanned expenses. The expenses of storm restoration efforts    may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process. Operation of a nuclear facility subjects us to    risk.  Ownership of an operating nuclear    generating plant subjects us to significant additional risks.    These risks include, among others, plant security, environmental    regulation and remediation, and operational factors that can    significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a    nuclear facility. While we maintain insurance for various    nuclear-related risks, there can be no assurances that such    insurance will be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of    an accident or business interruption at our nuclear generating    plant, which may affect our financial performance. The supply and price of fuel and other commodities and    related transportation costs may impact our financial    results.  We are dependent on coal for much of our    electrical generating capacity. Price fluctuations, fuel supply    disruptions and increases in transportation costs could have a    negative impact on our ability to profitably generate    electricity. Our access to natural gas supplies is critical to    ensure reliability of service for our utility gas customers. We    have hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms in    place to mitigate negative fluctuations in commodity supply    prices, but there can be no assurances that our financial    performance will not be negatively impacted by price    fluctuations. The price of natural gas also impacts the market    for our non-utility businesses that compete with utilities and    alternative electric suppliers. Increased transportation costs    could also impact our non-utility businesses. Unplanned power plant outages may be    costly.  Unforeseen maintenance may be required to    safely produce electricity or comply with environmental    regulations. As a result of unforeseen maintenance, we may be    required to make spot market purchases of electricity that    exceed our costs of generation. Our financial performance may be    negatively affected if we are unable to recover such increased    costs. Our estimates of gas reserves are subject to    change.  While we cannot provide absolute    assurance that our estimates of our Barnett gas reserves are    accurate, great care is exercised in utilizing historical    information and assumptions to develop reasonable estimates of    future production and cash flow. We estimate proved gas reserves    and the future net cash flows attributable to those reserves.    There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating    quantities of proved gas reserves and cash flows attributable to    such reserves, including factors beyond our control. Reserve    engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground    accumulations of gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner.    The accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves, or of    cash flows attributable to such reserves, is a function of the    available data, assumptions regarding expenditures for future    development and exploration activities, and of engineering and    geological interpretation and judgment. Additionally, reserves    and future cash flows may be subject to material downward or    upward revisions, based upon production history, development and    exploration activities and prices of gas. Actual future    production, revenue, taxes, development expenditures, operating    expenses, quantities of recoverable reserves and the value of    cash flows from such reserves may vary significantly from the    assumptions and underlying information we used. Our ability to utilize production tax credits may be    limited.  To reduce U.S. dependence on    imported oil, the Internal Revenue Code provides production tax    credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and    electricity from alternative sources. We have generated    production tax credits from the synfuel, coke    24Table of Contents    production, landfill gas recovery, biomass fired electric    generation and gas production operations. We have received    favorable private letter rulings on all of the synfuel    facilities. All production tax credits taken after 2003 are    subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If our    production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a    result of an IRS audit, there could be additional tax    liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that    could significantly impact our earnings and cash flows. We have    also provided certain guarantees and indemnities in conjunction    with the sales of interests in the synfuel facilities. We rely on cash flows from subsidiaries.  DTE    Energy is a holding company. Cash flows from our utility and    non-utility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses    and dividends on DTE Energy debt and securities. Should a major    subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows    to DTE Energy, our ability to pay interest and dividends would    be restricted. Environmental laws and liability may be    costly.  We are subject to numerous environmental    regulations. These regulations govern air emissions, water    quality, wastewater discharge, and disposal of solid and    hazardous waste. Compliance with these regulations can    significantly increase capital spending, operating expenses and    plant down times. These laws and regulations require us to seek    a variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and    other regulatory approvals. Additionally, we may become a    responsible party for environmental clean up at sites identified    by a regulatory body. We cannot predict with certainty the    amount and timing of future expenditures related to    environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating    clean up costs. There is also uncertainty in quantifying    liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and    several liability on potentially responsible parties.     We may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future    requirements to address climate change issues. Proposals for    voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed    both in the United States and worldwide to reduce greenhouse    gases such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil    fuels. If increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions are    implemented, the operations of our fossil-fuel generation assets    may be significantly impacted.     Since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be    recovered through the regulatory process, our financial    performance may be negatively impacted as a result of    environmental matters. Terrorism could affect our business.  Damage to    downstream infrastructure or our own assets by terrorism would    impact our operations. We have increased security as a result of    past events and further security increases are possible. Benefits of continuous improvement initiatives could be less    than we expect.  We have a continuous improvement    program that is expected to result in significant cost savings.    Actual results achieved through this program could be less than    our expectations. A work interruption may adversely affect    us.  Unions represent approximately 5,000 of our    employees. A union choosing to strike would have an impact on    our business. We are unable to predict the effect a work    stoppage would have on our costs of operation and financial    performance. Failure to retain and attract key executive officers and    other skilled professional and technical employees could have an    adverse effect on our operations.  Our business is    dependent on our ability to recruit, retain, and motivate    employees. Competition for skilled employees in some areas is    high and the inability to retain and attract these employees    could adversely affect our business and future operating results. "

Electric Customer Choice migration is sensitive to market priceand bundled electric service price increases. The hybrid market in Michigan also causes uncertaintyas it relates to investment in new generating capacity.Weather significantly affects operations. Deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditionsaffect our earnings and cash flow. Mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of ourassets, lowering income and cash flow. Ice storms, tornadoes, or high winds can damage thedistribution system infrastructure and require us to perform emergency repairs and incur materialunplanned expenses.

We have hedging strategies in place to mitigate negative fluctuations in commoditysupply prices, but there can be no assurances that our financial performance will not be negativelyimpacted by price fluctuations. The price of natural gas also impacts the market for ournon-utility businesses that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers.24Table of ContentsUnplanned power plant outages may be costly. Unforeseen maintenance may be required to safelyproduce electricity or comply with environmental regulations. As a result of unforeseenmaintenance, we may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed our costsof generation. Our financial performance may be negatively affected if we are unable to recoversuch increased costs.Regional and national economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on us. Our businessesfollow the economic cycles of the customers we serve. Should national or regional economicconditions decline, reduced volumes of electricity and gas we supply will result in decreasedearnings and cash flow. Economic conditions in our service territory also impact our collections ofaccounts receivable and financial results.Our non-utility operations may not perform to our expectations. We rely on our non-utilityoperations for a portion of our earnings. If our current and contemplated non-utility investmentsdo not perform at expected levels, we could experience diminished earnings potential and acorresponding decline in our shareholder value.The inability to consummate strategic transactions for our non-utility operations could affect ourexpected cash flows. As part of a strategic review of our non-utility operations, we have takenand continue to pursue various actions including the acquisition, sale, restructuring orrecapitalization of various non-utility businesses. If we are not able to consummate strategictransactions on favorable terms or timing, our expected cash flows could be lower than anticipated.Our participation in energy trading markets subjects us to risk. Events in the energy tradingindustry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energyindustry as a whole. In certain situations we may also be required to post collateral to supporttrading operations. We have established risk policies to manage the business.Our estimates of gas reserves are subject to change. We provide no assurance that our estimates ofour Barnett gas reserves are accurate.

While credit ratings reflect the opinions of thecredit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance, adowngrade in our credit rating could restrict or discontinue our ability to access capital marketsand could increase our borrowing costs. In addition, a reduction in credit rating may require usto post collateral related to various trading contracts, which would impact our liquidity.25Table of ContentsOur ability to access capital markets at attractive interest rates is important. Our ability toaccess capital markets is important to operate our businesses. Heightened concerns about the energyindustry, the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limitour access to capital markets. Changes in interest rates could increase our borrowing costs andnegatively impact our financial performance.Poor investment performance of pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costscould unfavorably impact our liquidity and results of operations.Our costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a numberof factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to measurethe required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation, and our required orvoluntary contributions made to the plans. The performance of the capital markets affects thevalue of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our pension plans. Ifconditions within the overall credit market continue to deteriorate, the fair value of these plansassets may be negatively affected. Additionally, while we complied with the minimum fundingrequirements as of December 31, 2007, we have certain qualified pension plans with obligations thatexceeded the value of the plan assets. Without sustained growth in the pension investments overtime to increase the value of our plan assets, we could be required to fund our plans withsignificant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on ourcash flows, financial position, or results of operations.We are exposed to credit risk of counterparties with whom we do business. Adverse economicconditions affecting, or financial difficulties of, counterparties with whom we do business couldimpair the ability of these counterparties to pay for our services or fulfill their contractualobligations, or cause them to delay such payments or obligations. We depend on these counterpartiesto remit payments on a timely basis. Any delay or default in payment could adversely affect ourcash flows, financial position, or results of operations.Environmental laws and liability may be costly. We are subject to numerous environmentalregulations. These regulations govern air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharge, anddisposal of solid and hazardous waste. Compliance with these regulations can significantlyincrease capital spending, operating expenses and plant down times. These laws and regulationsrequire us to seek a variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other regulatoryapprovals. Additionally, we may become a responsible party for environmental clean up at sitesidentified by a regulatory body. We cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of futureexpenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean upcosts. There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that imposejoint and several liability on potentially responsible parties.We may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climatechange issues. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed bothin the United States and worldwide to reduce greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by-productof burning fossil fuels. If increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions are implemented, theoperations of our fossil-fuel generation assets may be significantly impacted.Since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatoryprocess, our financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters.We may not be fully covered by insurance. While we have a comprehensive insurance program in placeto provide coverage for various types of risks, catastrophic damage as a result of acts of God,terrorism, war or a combination of significant unforeseen events could impact our operations andeconomic losses might not be covered in full by insurance.Terrorism could affect our business. Damage to downstream infrastructure or our own assets byterrorism would impact our operations. We have increased security as a result of past events andfurther security increases are possible.26Table of ContentsBenefits of the Performance Excellence Process to us could be less than we have projected. In 2005,we initiated a company-wide review of our operations called the Performance Excellence Process,with the overarching goal to become more competitive by reducing costs, eliminating waste andoptimizing business processes while improving customer service. Actual results achieved throughthis process could be less than our expectations.A work interruption may adversely affect us. Unions represent approximately 5,000 of our employees.A union choosing to strike would have an impact on our business. We are unable to predict theeffect a work stoppage would have on our costs of operation and financial performance.Failure to retain and attract key executive officers and other skilled professional and technicalemployees could have an adverse effect on our operations. Our business is dependent on our abilityto recruit, retain, and motivate employees. Competition for skilled employees in some areas ishigh and the inability to retain and attract these employees could adversely affect our businessand future operating results.Our ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited. To reduce U.S. dependence on importedoil, the Internal Revenue Code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers toproduce fuels from alternative sources. We have generated production tax credits from the synfuel,coke battery, landfill gas recovery and gas production operations. We have received favorableprivate letter rulings on all of the synfuel facilities. All production tax credits taken after2003 are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If our production tax credits weredisallowed in whole or in part as a result of an IRS audit, there could be additional taxliabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact our earningsand cash flows. We have also provided certain guarantees and indemnities in conjunction with thesales of interests in the synfuel facilities"
13,DTE,DTE ENERGY CO,2007-03-01,">Item 1A. Company Risk Factors
There are various risks associated with the operations of DTE Energys utility and non-utilitybusinesses. To provide a framework to understand the operating environment of DTE Energy, we areproviding a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with our businesses.Although we have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors, others could emerge in the future.Each of the following risks could affect our performance.Our ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited. To reduce U.S. dependence on importedoil, the Internal Revenue Code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers toproduce fuels from alternative sources. We have generated production tax credits from the synfuel,coke battery, landfill gas recovery and gas production operations. We have received favorableprivate letter rulings on all of the synfuel facilities. All production tax credits taken after2003 are subject to audit by the Internal RevenueService (IRS). If our production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of anIRS audit, there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax creditsthat could significantly impact our earnings and cash flows. The value of future credits generatedmay be affected by potential legislation. Moreover, the opportunity to earn additional productiontax credits related to the generation of synfuels and recovery of landfill gas will expire at theend of 2007. The combination of IRS audits of production tax credits, supply and demand forinvestment in credit producing activities and potential legislation could have an impact on ourearnings and cash flows. We have also provided certain guarantees and indemnities in conjunctionwith the sales of interests in the synfuel facilities.This incentive provided by production tax credits is not deemed necessary if the price of oilincreases and provides significant market incentives for the production of these fuels. As such,the tax credit in a given year is reduced if the Reference Price of oil within that year exceeds athreshold price. The Reference Price of a barrel of oil is an estimate of the annual averagewellhead price per barrel for domestic crude oil. We project the yearly average wellhead price perbarrel of oil for the year to be approximately $6 lower than the NYMEX price for light, sweet crudeoil. The threshold price at which the credit begins to23Table of Contentsbe reduced was set in 1980 and is adjustedannually for inflation. For 2006, we estimate the threshold price at which the tax credit wouldbegin to be reduced is $55 per barrel and would be completely phased out if the Reference Pricereached $69 per barrel. As of December 31, 2006, the average NYMEX daily closing price of a barrelof oil was approximately $66 for 2006, equating to an estimated Reference Price of $60, which weestimate to be within the phase-out range. To mitigate the effect of a potential phase out andminimize operating losses, on May 12, 2006 we idled production at all nine of the synfuelfacilities. The decision to idle synfuel production was driven by the level and volatility of oilprices at that time. Beginning September 5, 2006 through October 4, 2006, we resumed production ateach of the nine synfuel facilities due to declines in the level of oil prices.Our estimates of gas reserves are subject to change. We cannot assure that our estimates of ourAntrim and Barnett gas reserves are accurate. Estimates of proved gas reserves and the future netcash flows attributable to those reserves are prepared by independent engineers. There are numerousuncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved gas reserves and cash flows attributableto such reserves, including factors beyond our control and that of our engineers. Reserveengineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of gas that cannot bemeasured in an exact manner. The accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves, or of cashflows attributable to such reserves, is a function of the available data, assumptions regardingexpenditures for future development and exploration activities, and of engineering and geologicalinterpretation and judgment. Additionally, reserves and future cash flows may be subject tomaterial downward or upward revisions, based upon production history, development and explorationactivities and prices of gas. Actual future production, revenue, taxes, development expenditures,operating expenses, underlying information, quantities of recoverable reserves and the value ofcash flows from such reserves may vary significantly from the assumptions and underlyinginformation we used. In addition, different reserve engineers may make different estimates ofreserves and cash flows based on the same available data.Michigans electric Customer Choice program is negatively impacting our financialperformance. Theelectric Customer Choice program, as originally contemplated in Michigan, anticipated an eventualtransition to a totally deregulated and competitive environment where customers would be chargedmarket-based rates for their electricity. The State of Michigan currently experiences a hybridmarket, where the MPSC continues to regulate electric rates for our customers, while alternativeelectric suppliers charge market-based rates. In addition, such regulated electric rates forcertain groups of our customers exceed the cost of service to those customers. Due to distortedpricing mechanisms during the initial implementation period of electric Customer Choice, manycommercial customers chose alternative electric suppliers. Recent MPSC rate orders have removedsome of the pricing disparity. Recent higher wholesale electric prices have also resulted in someformer electric Customer Choice customers migrating back to Detroit Edison for electric generationservice. Even with the electric Customer Choice-related rate relief received in Detroit Edisons2004 and 2005 orders, there continues to be considerable financial risk associated with theelectric Customer Choice program. Electric Customer Choice migration is sensitive tomarket price and bundled electric service price increases. The hybrid market in Michigan alsocauses uncertainity as it relates to investment in new generating capacity.Weather significantly affects operations. Deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditionsaffect our earnings and cash flow. Mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of ourassets, lowering income and cash flow. Damage due to ice storms, tornadoes, or high winds candamage our infrastructure and require us to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplannedexpenses. The expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be recoverable through the regulatoryprocess.We are subject to rate regulation. Electric and gas rates for our utilities are set by the MPSC andthe FERC and cannot be increased without regulatory authorization. We may be impacted by newregulations or interpretations by the MPSC, the FERC or other regulatory bodies. New legislation,regulations or interpretations could change how our business operates, impact our ability torecover costs through rate increases or require us to incur additional expenses.24Table of ContentsOur non-utility operations may not perform to our expectations. We rely on our non-utilityoperations for a significant portion of our earnings. If our current and contemplated non-utilityinvestments do not perform at expected levels, we could experience diminished earnings potentialand a corresponding decline in our shareholder value.We rely on cash flows from subsidiaries. Cash flows from our utility and non-utility subsidiariesare required to pay interest expenses and dividends on DTE Energy debt and securities. Should amajor subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to DTE Energy, our ability topay interest and dividends would be restricted.Adverse changes in our credit ratings may negatively affect us. Increased scrutiny of the energyindustry and regulatory changes, as well as changes in our economic performance, could result incredit agencies reexamining our credit rating. While credit ratings reflect the opinions of thecredit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance, adowngrade in our credit rating could restrict or discontinue our ability to access capital marketsat attractive rates and increase our borrowing costs. In addition, a reduction in credit ratingmay require us to post collateral related to various trading contracts, which would impact ourliquidity.Our ability to access capital markets at attractive interest rates is important. Our ability toaccess capital markets is important to operate our businesses. Heightened concerns about the energyindustry, the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limitour access to capital markets. Changes in interest rates could increase our borrowing costs andnegatively impact our financial performance.Regional and national economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on us. Our businessesfollow the economic cycles of the customers we serve. Should national or regional economicconditions decline, reduced volumes of electricity and gas we supply will result in decreasedearnings and cash flow. Economic conditions in our service territory also impact our collections ofaccounts receivable and financial results.Environmental laws and liability may be costly. We are subject to numerous environmentalregulations. These regulations govern air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharge, anddisposal of solid and hazardous waste. Compliance with these regulations can significantlyincrease capital spending, operating expenses and plant down times. These laws and regulationsrequire us to seek a variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other regulatoryapprovals. We may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to addressthe climate change issue. The regulatory environment is subject to significant change; therefore,we cannot predict how future issues may impact the company.Additionally, we may become a responsible party for environmental clean up at sites identified by aregulatory body. We cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expendituresrelated to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up costs. There isalso uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and severalliability on potentially responsible parties.Since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatoryprocess, our financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters.Operation of a nuclear facility subjects us to risk. Ownership of an operating nuclear generatingplant subjects us to significant additional risks. These risks include among others, plantsecurity, environmental regulation and remediation, and operational factors that can significantlyimpact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility. While we maintain insurance forvarious nuclear-related risks, there can be no assurances that such insurance will be sufficient tocover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at our nuclear generatingplant, which may affect our financial performance.25Table of ContentsThe supply and price of fuel and other commodities may impact our financial results. We aredependent on coal for much of our electrical generating capacity. Price fluctuations and fuelsupply disruptions could have a negative impact on our ability to profitably generate electricity.Our access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for our utility gascustomers. We have hedging strategies in place to mitigate negative fluctuations in commoditysupply prices, but there can be no assurances that our financial performance will not be negativelyimpacted by price fluctuations. The price of natural gas also impacts the market for ournon-utility businesses that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers.A work interruption may adversely affect us. Unions represent approximately 5,400 of our employees.A union choosing to strike as a negotiating tactic would have an impact on our business. We areunable to predict the effects a work stoppage would have on our costs of operation and financialperformance.Unplanned power plant outages may be costly. Unforeseen maintenance may be required to safelyproduce electricity or comply with environmental regulations. As a result of unforeseenmaintenance, we may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed our costsof generation. Our financial performance may be negatively affected if we are unable to recoversuch increased costs.Michigan tax reform may be costly. The State of Michigan is experiencing a revenue shortfall. Weare a significant taxpayer in the State of Michigan. The legislature is expected to change the taxlaws in 2007, and we could face increased taxes.We may not be fully covered by insurance. While we have a comprehensive insurance program in placeto provide coverage for various types of risks, catastrophic damage as a result of acts of God,terrorism, war or a combination of significant unforeseen events could impact our operations andeconomic losses might not be covered in full by insurance.Terrorism could affect our business. Damage to downstream infrastructure or our own assets byterrorism would impact our operations. We have increased security as a result of past events andfurther security increases are possible.Our participation in energy trading markets subjects us to risk. Events in the energy tradingindustry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energyindustry as a whole. In certain situations we may also be required to post collateral to supporttrading operations. We have established risk policies to manage the business.Failure to successfully implement new processes and information systems could interrupt ouroperations. Our businesses depend on numerous information systems for operations and financialinformation and billings. We are in the midst of a multi-year Company-wide initiative to improveexisting processes and implement new core information systems. We launched the first phase of ourEnterprise Business Systems project in 2005. Additional phases of implementation are planned for2007. Failure to successfully implement new processes and new core information systems couldinterrupt our operations.Benefits of the Performance Excellence Process to the Company could be less than the Company hasprojected. In 2005, we initiated a company-wide review of our operations called the PerformanceExcellence Process with the overarching goal to become more competitive by reducing costs,eliminating waste and optimizing business processes while improving customer service. Actualresults achieved through this process could be less than the Companys expectations.The inability to consummate any strategic transactions for our non-utility operations could affectour expected cash flows. As part of a strategic review of our non-utility operations, we areconsidering various actions including the sale, restructuring or recapitalization of variousnon-utility businesses. If we are not able to consummate any strategic transactions on favorableterms or timing, our expected cash flows could be lower than anticipated.26Table of Contents"
