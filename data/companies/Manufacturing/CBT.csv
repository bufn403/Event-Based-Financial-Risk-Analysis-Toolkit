 In addition to factors described elsewhere in this report, the following are important factors that could adversely affect our business. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations and financial results.Industry RisksIndustry capacity utilization and competition from other specialty chemical companies may adversely impact our business.Our businesses are sensitive to industry capacity utilization, and pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur, which could affect our financial performance. Further, we operate in a highly competitive marketplace. Our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize new and innovative, high value-added products for existing and future customers. Increased competition from existing or newly developed products offered by our competitors or companies whose products offer a similar functionality as our products, particularly those with an improved environmental footprint, and could be substituted for our products, may negatively affect demand for our products. In addition, actions by our competitors could impair our ability to maintain or raise prices, successfully enter new markets or maintain or grow our market position.Environmental regulations and restrictions that affect the carbon black industry impose constraints on our operations, and could threaten our competitive position and increase our operating costs, which may adversely impact our business and results of operations.Our ongoing carbon black operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to environmental matters, many of which provide for substantial monetary fines and civil and criminal sanctions for violations. These include requirements to obtain and comply with various environmental-related and other permits for constructing any new facilities and operating all of our existing facilities, as well as settlements with agencies regarding environmental matters and environmental requirements. These environmental regulatory requirements and restrictions impose constraints on our operations, and could threaten our competitive position. We have expended and will continue to expend considerable amounts to construct, maintain, operate, and improve our facilities around the world for environmental protection. In addition, the increased emphasis on environmental justice, which is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all individuals and communities in which we operate, regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, with respect to the development, implementation and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies, could result in increased compliance requirements and costs.  Furthermore, our actual or perceived failure to adhere to these principles could harm our reputation.15 Further, environmental agencies worldwide are increasingly implementing regulations and other requirements resulting in more restrictive air emission limits globally, particularly as they relate to nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter emissions. We expect complying with existing regulations and other regulatory and tax changes being proposed in regions where we operate, if approved, will require us to incur significant additional costs for compliance, capital improvements or limit our current or planned operations. We may not be able to offset the effects of these compliance costs through price increases. Our ability to implement price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased regulatory costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales.A description of these matters is included in the discussion under the heading “Safety, Health, Environment, and Sustainability” in Item 1 above, and in Note S in Item 8 below under the heading “Contingencies”.We may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change developments and an increased focus on carbon neutrality, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations, and increased pressures and adverse publicity about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation.Carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, is emitted in carbon black manufacturing processes. Concerns about the relationship between greenhouse gases and global climate change, and an increased focus on carbon neutrality, may result in additional regulations on both national and supranational levels, to monitor, regulate, control and tax emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Climate changes include extreme weather impacts, such as changes in rainfall and in storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, significantly changing sea levels and increasing atmospheric and water temperatures. A number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to climate change, including regulating greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, in certain geographic areas, our carbon black facilities are or may become subject to greenhouse gas emission trading schemes or carbon tax programs under which we may be required to pay any incurred taxes or purchase emission credits if our emission levels exceed our free allocation. The outcome of new legislation or regulation in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional requirements and fees or restrictions on certain activities. Compliance with greenhouse gas and climate change initiatives may result in additional costs to us, including, among other things, increased production costs, increased feedstock costs, additional taxes, reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on production or operations. In addition, certain of our carbon black products for specialty applications have higher greenhouse gas emissions than our other products, which may increase our compliance costs and make it more challenging to achieve our emissions goals without technology developments. We may not be able to offset the effects of these new or more stringent laws and regulations and compliance costs through price increases, which could adversely affect our business and negatively impact our growth. Our ability to implement price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased regulatory costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales. Any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. Even without such regulation, increased public awareness and adverse publicity about potential impacts on climate change or environmental harm from us or our industry could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the Company adversely. In recent years, investors have also begun to show increased interest in sustainability and climate change as it relates to their investment decisions. Our failure to develop and execute a sustainability strategy that adequately responds to these environmental concerns could harm our reputation and negatively impact the value of our securities. In addition, new disclosure requirements related to GHG emissions and climate change, including the European Sustainability Reporting Standards, any final rules approved by the SEC, and state laws requiring climate disclosure, may negatively impact our business by diverting resources, increasing our compliance costs and harming our reputation. Further, increasing weather-related impacts on our operations and plant sites may impact the cost or availability of insurance. Furthermore, the potential impact of climate change and related regulation on our feedstock suppliers and customers is highly uncertain and there can be no assurance that it will not have an adverse effect on the availability, over time, of our traditional carbon black feedstocks, our customers’ businesses and sourcing arrangements, and on our financial condition and results of operations. For instance, lower demand for oil refinery products may reduce the availability and increase the cost of certain of the key raw materials we use. In addition, many of our tire customers have set sustainability goals for the 2030 to 2050 time period to purchase more sustainable raw materials, including reduced use of fossil-derived materials, which could reduce demand for our traditional carbon black products. We cannot predict how legal, regulatory and social responses to concerns about climate change, as well as other sustainability and environmental matters, will impact our business.16 Volatility in the price and availability of raw materials and energy could impact our margins and working capital and our revenues from our energy center operations.Our manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of energy and raw materials, the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond our control. Our carbon black businesses use a variety of feedstocks as raw material including high sulfur fuel oils, low sulfur fuel oils, coal tar distillates, and ethylene cracker residue, the cost and availability of which vary, based in part on geography. Significant movements or volatility in our carbon black feedstock costs could have an adverse effect on our working capital and results of operations. In addition, regulatory changes or geopolitical conflict may impact the availability and prices of our raw materials. For example, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has disrupted and may continue to disrupt the price and availability of natural gas in Europe.Certain of our carbon black supply arrangements contain provisions that adjust prices to account for changes in relevant feedstock and natural gas price indices. We also attempt to offset the effects of increases in raw material and energy costs through selling price increases in our non-contract sales, productivity improvements and cost reduction efforts. Success in offsetting increased raw material and energy costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased raw material and energy costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales. If we are not able to fully offset the effects of increased raw material or energy costs, it could have a significant impact on our financial results. Rapid declines in energy prices and raw material costs can also negatively impact our financial results, as such changes can negatively affect the revenues we receive from our energy centers and yield improvement investments, and may negatively impact our contract pricing adjustments. In addition, we use a variety of feedstock indices in our supply arrangements to adjust our prices for changes in raw materials costs. Depending on feedstock markets and our choice of feedstocks, the indices we use in our supply arrangements may not precisely track our actual costs. This could result in an incongruity between our pricing adjustments and changes in our actual feedstock costs, which can affect our net working capital and our margins. Further, the timing of the implementation of any of these pricing adjustments may not precisely track our actual costs as reflected in our financial statements.In addition, we obtain certain of our raw materials from selected key suppliers. Although we typically maintain raw material inventory, if any sole source supplier of raw materials ceases supplying raw materials to us, or if any of our key suppliers is unable to meet its obligations under supply agreements with us on a timely basis or at an acceptable price, or at all, we may be forced to incur higher costs to obtain the necessary raw materials elsewhere or, in certain limited cases, may not be able to obtain the required raw materials.A significant adverse change in a customer or joint venture relationship or the failure of a customer or joint venture partner to perform its obligations under agreements with us could harm our business or cash flows. Our success in strengthening relationships and growing business with our largest customers and retaining their business over extended time periods is important to our future results. We have a group of key customers across our businesses that together represent a significant portion of our total net sales and operating revenues. The loss of any of our important customers, or a significant reduction in volumes sold to them, could adversely affect our results of operations until such business is replaced or any temporary disruption ends. Further, in our Reinforcement Materials segment we enter into supply arrangements with a number of key customers that typically have a duration of one year, which account for approximately two-thirds of our total reinforcing carbons volumes. Our success in negotiating the price and volume terms under these arrangements could have a material effect on our results. In addition, a number of our operations are conducted through joint venture arrangements that operate pursuant to long-term contracts, including for the supply of raw materials for the joint venture operations. Any dispute as to the terms of these contractual arrangements or deterioration in the relationship between us and our joint venture partner could disrupt the operations of the joint venture, which could affect our financial results and harm our reputation. In addition, any deterioration in the financial condition of any of our customers that impairs our customers’ ability to make payments to us also could increase our uncollectible receivables and could affect our future results and financial condition. We are exposed to political or country risk inherent in doing business in some countries, including China.Sales outside of the U.S. constituted the majority of our revenues in fiscal 2023. We conduct business in several countries, including China, that have less stable legal systems and financial markets, and potentially more corrupt, or less predictable, business environments than the U.S. As set forth in Note T to our Consolidated Financial Statements, sales in China constituted approximately 25% of our revenues in fiscal 2023 and our property, plant and equipment located in China constituted approximately 25% of our total property, plant and equipment as of September 30, 2023. Our operations outside of the U.S., including in China, expose us to risks related to uncertain enforcement of laws by foreign governments as well as risks that foreign governmental entities will change applicable rules and regulations with minimal advance notice. These risks could result in a material change in our operations, which could negatively impact the value of our securities. Additionally, our operations in some countries, including China, are subject to the following risks: changes in the rate of economic growth; unsettled political or economic conditions; non-renewal of operating 17 permits or licenses; possible expropriation or other governmental actions; corruption by government officials and other third parties; social unrest, war, terrorist activities or other armed conflict; confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; deprivation of contract rights; trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; restrictions or additional costs associated with repatriating cash; exchange controls; inflation; currency fluctuations and devaluation; political tension that could result in sanctions being imposed against our customers or suppliers in countries where sanctions have not been imposed in the past; the effect of global health, safety and environmental matters on economic conditions and market opportunities; and changes in financial policy and availability of credit.For example, the Chinese government has, from time to time, curtailed manufacturing operations, with little or no notice, in industrial regions out of concerns over air quality and in response to COVID-19 outbreaks. The timing and length of these curtailments has been difficult to predict and, at times, were applied to manufacturing operations without regard to whether the operations being curtailed comply with environmental regulations in the area. Accordingly, our manufacturing operations in China have been subject to these curtailments in the past and may be subject to them in the future. In addition, the Chinese government has instituted energy intensity and energy consumption targets in a number of provinces in its efforts to reduce energy consumption, resulting in energy quotas and shortages in energy supply. We are unable to predict how any power outages related to these targets will impact our operations. These events could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows both during and after the period of any government-imposed curtailment or power outages affecting our operations. Further, any such curtailments on the operations at our customers’ facilities could reduce demand for our products and our volumes.Operational RisksAs a chemical manufacturing company, our operations are subject to operational risks and have the potential to cause environmental or other damage as well as personal injury, or disrupt our ability to supply our customers, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.The operation of a chemical manufacturing business as well as the sale and distribution of chemical products are subject to operational as well as safety, health and environmental risks. For example, the production and/or processing of carbon black, specialty compounds, fumed metal oxides, aerogel, carbon nanotubes and other chemicals involve the handling, transportation, manufacture or use of certain substances or components that may be considered toxic or hazardous. While we take precautions to handle and transport these materials in a safe manner, if they are mishandled or released into the environment, they could cause property damage or result in personal injury claims against us. Our manufacturing processes and the transportation of our chemical products and/or the raw materials used to manufacture our products are subject to risks inherent in chemical manufacturing, including leaks, fires, explosions, toxic releases, severe weather, mechanical failures or unscheduled downtime.  In addition, the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities, particularly at a facility that is the sole source of a particular product we manufacture, or a disruption in our supply chain or distribution operations may result in loss of production, which, in turn, may make it difficult for us to meet customer needs. For example, in recent years we have experienced unplanned plant outages at our plants in Franklin, Louisiana and Altamira, Mexico that caused reduced volumes and earnings during the period the plant was down and increased our fixed costs. Other disruptions in supply chains and distribution channels, including those caused by global or regional logistics delays and constraints, such as rail or other transportation interruptions, could disrupt our business operations. These events and their consequences could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows, both during and after the period of operational difficulties, and could harm our reputation.An interruption in our operations as a result of fence-line arrangements or a joint venture partner's actions could disrupt our manufacturing operations and adversely affect our financial results.At certain of our fumed metal oxides facilities we have fence-line arrangements (many of which are closed-loop) with adjacent third-party manufacturing operations (“fence-line partners”), who provide raw materials for our manufacturing operations and/or take by-products generated from our operations. Accordingly, any disruptions or curtailments in a fence-line partner’s production facilities that impacts their ability to supply us with raw materials or to take our manufacturing by-products could disrupt our manufacturing operations or cause us to incur increased operating costs to mitigate such disruption. We have experienced disruptions in the supply of raw materials from certain of our fence-line partners in recent years, which have caused us to curtail our operations or incur higher operating costs. In addition, we operate certain of our carbon black facilities through joint venture arrangements, pursuant to which our joint venture partners provide feedstock and/or take by-products generated from our operations. A dispute with a joint venture partner concerning the terms of those arrangements could impact our joint venture operations and could decrease our income from such operations. Significant events at neighboring industrial facilities, such as environmental releases, could also disrupt our operations and result in negative publicity about us and harm our reputation. 18  Our products are subject to extensive safety, health and environmental requirements, which could impair our ability to manufacture and sell certain products. In order to secure and maintain the right to produce or sell our products, we must satisfy product related regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions. Obtaining and maintaining these approvals requires a significant amount of product testing and data, and there is no certainty these approvals will be obtained. Certain national and international health organizations have classified carbon black as a possible or suspected human carcinogen. To the extent that, in the future, (i) these organizations re-classify carbon black as a known or confirmed carcinogen, (ii) other organizations or government authorities in other jurisdictions classify carbon black or any of our other finished products, raw materials or intermediates as suspected or known carcinogens or otherwise hazardous, or (iii) there is discovery of adverse health effects attributable to production or use of carbon black or any of our other finished products, raw materials or intermediates, we could be required to incur significantly higher costs to comply with environmental, health and safety laws, or to comply with restrictions on sales of our products, be subject to legal claims, and our reputation and business could be adversely affected. Further, a subset of multi-walled carbon nanotubes that includes a carbon nanotube grade we currently manufacture have been classified as carcinogen category 1B and specific target organ toxicant (lung) after repeated exposure category 1 under European Union regulations. Although our carbon nanotubes are bound in a matrix or contained within conductive materials, exposure to carbon nanotubes could occur in the workplace. We could be required to incur additional costs to comply with requirements for the safe manufacturing and handling of these materials and we could be subject to legal claims associated with our products. In addition, chemicals that are currently classified as non-hazardous may be classified as hazardous in the future, and our products may have characteristics that are not recognized today but may be found in the future to impair human health or to be carcinogenic.Information technology systems failures, data security breaches, cybersecurity attacks or network disruptions have harmed us in the past and could compromise our information, disrupt our operations and expose us to liability, which may adversely impact our operations.We rely on information technology, some of which is managed by third parties, to manage the day-to-day operations and activities of our business, operate elements of our manufacturing facilities, manage our customer and vendor transactions, and maintain our financial, accounting and business records. In addition, we collect and store certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations.The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this data is critical to our operations and business strategy. Information technology systems failures, including those associated with our managed service provider or related to maintaining or upgrading our systems or integrating information technology and other systems in connection with the integration of businesses we acquire, or network disruptions could disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions and our financial reporting, and our operations, including by contributing to a process safety event, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In the past, our networks have been subject to an attack, potentially by suspected foreign nation-state attackers, who conducted reconnaissance and deployed malware.  While our systems were able to isolate and expel the attacker before we believe material harm was caused, criminals, rogue insiders, nation-state, and other attackers may continue to attack our network, and our defenses may be unable to succeed in detecting their actions or stop them from inflicting potentially material harms including by theft, destruction, misuse, or corruption of our data or systems or those of other entities whose systems may interconnect with ours.In addition, our information technology systems could be compromised by outside parties intent on extracting information, corrupting information or disrupting business processes. Despite our security design and controls, and those of our third-party providers, we may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, security breaches, inadvertent or intentional employee actions, system failures and other risks that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data, improper use of our, or our third-party provider systems, solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, or operational disruptions. We face increased information technology security and fraud risks due to our increased reliance on working remotely, which may create additional information security vulnerabilities and/or magnify the impact of any disruption in information technology systems. Additionally, we have in the past and may in the future be exposed to unauthorized access to our information technology systems through undetected vulnerabilities in our or our service providers’ information systems or software. With the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, the scope and impact of any information security incident cannot be predicted. In addition, more than a dozen states in the United States have also passed comprehensive data protection legislation, and the global regulatory environment pertaining to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with new and changing requirements, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, The Personal Information Protection Law of the People’s Republic of China, and Brazil’s Lei Geral de Protecao de Dados. Complying with these 19 laws and regulations may be more costly or take longer than we anticipate, and any failure to comply could result in fines or penalties.Breaches of our security measures, cyber incidents and disruptions, or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential information about the Company, our employees, our vendors, or our customers, or failure to comply with laws and regulations related to information security or privacy, could result in legal claims or proceedings against us by governmental entities or individuals, significant fines, penalties and judgments, disruption of our operations, remediation requirements, changes to our business practices, and damage to our reputation, and could otherwise harm our business and our results of operations. Natural disasters and severe weather events could affect our operations and financial results.We operate facilities in areas of the world that are exposed to natural hazards, such as floods, windstorms, hurricanes, and earthquakes. In addition, extreme weather events and changing weather patterns present physical risks on existing infrastructure that may become more frequent or more severe as a result of factors related to climate change. Such events could disrupt our supply of raw materials or otherwise affect production, transportation and delivery of our products or affect demand for our products and otherwise harm our business and our results of operations, potentially in material ways that may exceed available insurance coverage in the particular circumstances.We have experienced recent disruptions of the type described above. For example, the severe flooding that occurred in Western Europe in July 2021 caused significant damage to our specialty compounds plant in Pepinster, Belgium. That disruption resulted in a near-term reduction in earnings from lower volumes and certain increases in our operating costs. Financial and Other RisksNegative or uncertain worldwide or regional economic conditions or trade relations, as well as regional conflicts, may adversely impact our business.Our operations and performance are affected by worldwide and regional economic conditions. Uncertainty or a deterioration in the economic conditions affecting the businesses to which, or geographic areas in which, we sell products could reduce demand for our products and inflationary pressures may increase our costs. We may also experience pricing pressure on products and services, or be unsuccessful in passing along to our customers an increase in our raw materials costs or energy prices, which could decrease our revenues and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. In addition, during periods of economic uncertainty, our customers may temporarily pursue inventory reduction (“destocking”) measures that exceed declines in the actual underlying demand. Given our position in the value chains for our principal products, we typically experience greater destocking impacts in our results of operations early in a recessionary cycle.Regional conflicts may also adversely impact our business. While we do not have manufacturing operations in Russia or Ukraine, and we do not have material sales in Ukraine and have stopped sales into Russia, Russia’s continuing invasion of Ukraine is negatively impacting economic conditions in Europe.  This could reduce demand for our products in our EMEA region, and negatively impact our and our customers’ ability to operate plants in Europe, and harm our suppliers and otherwise increase our operating costs.In addition, changes in, or tensions relating to, U.S. trade relations with countries where we do business may adversely impact our business. For example, tensions in the U.S.-China trade relationship have led to an increased risk of sanctions being imposed against our suppliers and customers in China which, if imposed, could restrict our ability to do business with such companies. In addition, we may encounter unexpected operating difficulties in China, more restrictive investment opportunities in China, greater difficulty transferring funds, more restrictive travel in and out of China, or negative currency impacts. Further, the cost of our capital projects may be higher than anticipated because of trade tariffs. In addition, escalating tensions in the U.S.-China trade relationship and/or restrictive policies by either country could require us to duplicate the technology resources and capabilities we have in China, particularly those related to our battery materials product line, in a geography outside China, thereby increasing our costs.Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results.As more fully described in Note S in Item 8 below under the heading “Contingencies”, we are a party to or the subject of lawsuits, claims, and proceedings, including, but not limited to, those involving environmental, and health and safety matters as well as product liability and personal injury claims relating to asbestosis, silicosis, and coal worker’s pneumoconiosis. We are also a potentially responsible party in various environmental proceedings and remediation matters wherein substantial amounts are at issue. Adverse rulings, judgments or settlements in pending or future litigation (including liabilities associated with respirator claims) or in connection with environmental remediation activities could adversely affect our financial results or cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in any forward-looking statements. 20 Our tax rate and other tax obligations are dependent upon a number of factors, a change in any of which could impact our future tax rates and financial results.Our future tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: changes in the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the estimated realization of our net deferred tax assets; the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for non-U.S. withholding taxes; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes; changes in available tax credits; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; and changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws. In addition, losses for which no tax benefits can be recorded could materially impact our tax rate and its volatility from one quarter to another.Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates affect our financial results.We earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In fiscal 2023, we derived a majority of our revenues from sales outside the U.S. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in countries where we operate will affect our results of operations and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. For example, in fiscal 2023, we recorded foreign exchange losses related to the remeasurement of our net monetary assets denominated in Argentine pesos, as the official Argentine exchange rate weakened compared to the U.S. dollar throughout the year. In addition, we may have foreign currency losses from government-controlled currency devaluations, such as the foreign currency losses we recorded in fiscal 2023 related to the impact of the sharp devaluation of the Argentine peso that was guided by the Argentine central bank. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time. In addition, we are exposed to adverse changes in interest rates. We use a combination of commercial paper and borrowings under our Credit Agreements to meet our short-term cash needs, with borrowings intra-quarter that may be higher than at quarter-end. As this debt is at variable interest rates, the higher interest rate environment as compared to recent years increases our borrowing costs.  We manage both these risks through normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative instruments as well as foreign currency debt. We cannot be certain, however, that we will be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.Any future outbreak of a widespread health epidemic could materially and adversely impact our business in the future.Our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases, such as the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus beginning in December 2019 (“COVID-19”). A global health crisis could have a serious adverse impact on the economy and on our business, results of operations and cash flows as the COVID-19 pandemic and associated containment efforts did in fiscal 2020. Specifically, a pandemic or future global health crisis may disrupt operations at our customers and reduce demand for our products, require or cause us to cease operations or idle production lines at our facilities, could materially affect our ability to adequately staff and maintain our operations, including in the event government authorities impose mandatory closures, such as those imposed in China as part of that country’s “Zero COVID” policy, work-from-home orders and social distancing protocols, and seek voluntary facility closures and impose other restrictions to mitigate the further spread of disease. A global health crisis could also disrupt our supply chain and materially and adversely impact our ability to secure supplies for our facilities and to provide personal protective equipment for our employees, which could materially and adversely affect our operations. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has also contributed to increased costs and decreased availability of labor and materials for construction projects, and these factors have increased the costs of our capital improvement projects and delayed our completion of such projects. Factors that will influence the impact on our business and operations include the duration and extent of the pandemic, the extent of imposed or recommended containment and mitigation measures and their impact on our operations and the operations of our customers, and the general economic consequences of the pandemic. We have entered into a number of derivative contracts with financial counterparties. The effectiveness of these contracts is dependent on the ability of these financial counterparties to perform their obligations and their nonperformance could harm our financial condition.We have entered into forward foreign currency contracts and cross-currency swaps as part of our financial risk management strategy. The effectiveness of our risk management program using these instruments is dependent, in part, upon the counterparties to these contracts honoring their financial obligations. If any of our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations in the future, we could be exposed to increased earnings and cash flow volatility due to an instrument’s failure to hedge or adequately address a financial risk.21 Technology RisksWe may not be successful achieving our growth expectations from new products, new applications and technology developments, and money we spend on these efforts may not result in an increase in revenues or profits commensurate with our investment.We may not be successful achieving our growth expectations from developing new products or product applications. Moreover, we cannot be certain that the costs we incur investing in new product and technology development will result in an increase in revenues or profits commensurate with our investment or within the time period we expect. For example, our investments to further develop our E2C® solutions, inkjet dispersions and inks, and battery materials applications may not result in the earnings growth expectations on which these investments are being made, or we may not realize such growth in line with our expectations when we made such investments. Similarly, we cannot be certain that the investments we are making in our EVOLVE® Sustainable Solutions technology platform to develop products for our customers using sustainable reinforcing carbons from renewable or recycled materials or using processes that result in lower GHG emissions will be successful, including within the time period our customers expect. In addition, the timely commercialization of products that we are developing may be disrupted or delayed by manufacturing or other technical difficulties, market acceptance or insufficient market size to support a new product, competitors’ new products, and difficulties in moving from the experimental stage to the production stage. These disruptions or delays could affect our future business results.The continued protection of our patents, trade secrets and other proprietary intellectual property rights is important to our success.Our patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and competitive position. We own various patents and other intellectual property rights in the U.S. and other countries covering many of our products, as well as processes and product uses. Where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable, we rely on trade secret laws and practices to protect our proprietary technology and processes, such as physical security, limited dissemination and access and confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, consultants, business partners, potential licensees and others to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect and the protective measures we have put in place may not prevent disclosure or unauthorized use of our proprietary information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of misappropriation or other violations of our proprietary rights. In addition, we are a licensee of various patents and intellectual property rights belonging to others in the U.S. and other countries. Because the laws and enforcement mechanisms of some countries may not allow us to protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as we are able to do in the U.S., the strength of our intellectual property rights will vary from country to country.Irrespective of our proprietary intellectual property rights, we may be subject to claims that our products, processes or product uses infringe the intellectual property rights of others. These claims, even if they are without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend and if we were to lose such claims, we could be enjoined from selling our products or using our processes and/or be subject to damages, or be required to enter into licensing agreements requiring royalty payments and/or use restrictions. Licensing agreements may not be available to us, or if available, may not be available on acceptable terms.Portfolio Management, Capacity Expansion and Integration RisksAny failure to realize benefits from acquisitions, alliances or joint ventures or to achieve our portfolio management objectives could adversely affect future financial results. In achieving our strategic plan objectives, we may pursue acquisitions, alliances or joint ventures intended to complement or expand our existing businesses globally or add product technology, or both. The success of acquisitions of businesses, new technologies and products, or arrangements with third parties is not always predictable and we may not be successful in realizing our objectives as anticipated. We may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business results. In addition to strategic acquisitions, we evaluate our portfolio in light of our objectives and alignment with our growth strategy. In implementing this strategy, we may not be successful in separating non-strategic assets. The gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such assets may affect our earnings. Moreover, we have in the past, and may again in the future, incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce earnings. As described in Note D in Item 8 below under the heading “Divestitures”, we recorded an asset impairment charge and a loss on sale of business in fiscal 2022 in connection with the disposition of our Purification Solutions business.22 Plant capacity expansions and site development projects may impact existing plant operations, be delayed and/or not achieve the expected benefits.Our ability to complete capacity expansions and site development projects, including capacity conversions from reinforcing carbons to specialty carbons and other site development projects, as planned may be delayed or interrupted by the need to obtain environmental and other regulatory approvals, unexpected cost increases, availability of labor and materials, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. These risks include the risk that existing plant operations are disrupted as well as the risk associated with delays in the start-up of operations using new technologies, which disruptions could make it difficult for us to meet our customer needs. Moreover, in the case of capacity expansions, the cost of these activities could have a negative impact on the financial performance of the relevant business until capacity utilization at the particular facility is sufficient to absorb the incremental costs associated with an expansion. In addition, our ability to expand capacity in emerging regions depends in part on economic and political conditions in these regions and, in some cases, on our ability to establish operations, construct additional manufacturing capacity or form strategic business alliances"
11,CBT,CABOT CORP,2022-11-23,"Risk Factors
 In addition to factors described elsewhere in this report, the following are important factors that could adversely affect our business. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations and financial results.Industry RisksIndustry capacity utilization and competition from other specialty chemical companies may adversely impact our business.Our businesses are sensitive to industry capacity utilization, and pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur, which could affect our financial performance. Further, we operate in a highly competitive marketplace. Our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize new and innovative, high value-added products for existing and future customers. Increased competition from existing or newly developed products offered by our competitors or companies whose products offer a similar functionality as our products, particularly those with an improved environmental footprint, and could be substituted for our products, may negatively affect demand for our products. In addition, actions by our competitors could impair our ability to maintain or raise prices, successfully enter new markets or maintain or grow our market position.Environmental regulations and restrictions that affect the carbon black industry impose constraints on our operations, and could threaten our competitive position and increase our operating costs, which may adversely impact our business and results of operations.Our ongoing carbon black operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to environmental matters, many of which provide for substantial monetary fines and civil and criminal sanctions for violations. These include requirements to obtain and comply with various environmental-related and other permits for constructing any new facilities and operating all of our existing facilities. These environmental regulatory requirements and restrictions impose constraints on our operations, and could threaten our competitive position. We have expended and will continue to expend considerable amounts to construct, maintain, operate, and improve our facilities around the world for environmental protection.Further, environmental agencies worldwide are increasingly implementing regulations and other requirements resulting in more restrictive air emission limits globally, particularly as they relate to nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter emissions. We expect complying with existing regulations and other regulatory and tax changes being proposed in regions where we operate, if approved, will require us to incur significant additional costs for compliance, capital improvements or limit our current or planned operations. We may not be able to offset the effects of these compliance costs through price increases. Our ability to implement price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased regulatory costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales.14A description of these matters is included in the discussion under the heading “Safety, Health, Environment, and Sustainability” in Item 1 above, and in Note S in Item 8 below under the heading “Contingencies”.We may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change developments and an increased focus on carbon neutrality, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations, and increased pressures and adverse publicity about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation.Carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, is emitted in carbon black manufacturing processes. Concerns about the relationship between greenhouse gases and global climate change, and an increased focus on carbon neutrality, may result in additional regulations on both national and supranational levels, to monitor, regulate, control and tax emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Climate changes include extreme weather impacts, such as changes in rainfall and in storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, significantly changing sea levels and increasing atmospheric and water temperatures. A number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to climate change, including regulating greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, in certain geographic areas, our carbon black facilities are or may become subject to greenhouse gas emission trading schemes or carbon tax programs under which we may be required to pay any incurred taxes or purchase emission credits if our emission levels exceed our free allocation. The outcome of new legislation or regulation in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional requirements and fees or restrictions on certain activities. Compliance with greenhouse gas and climate change initiatives may result in additional costs to us, including, among other things, increased production costs, increased feedstock costs, additional taxes, reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on production or operations. In addition, certain of our carbon black products for specialty applications have higher greenhouse gas emissions than our other products, which may increase our compliance costs and make it more challenging to achieve our emissions goals without technology developments. We may not be able to offset the effects of these new or more stringent laws and regulations and compliance costs through price increases, which could adversely affect our business and negatively impact our growth. Our ability to implement price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased regulatory costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales. Any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. Even without such regulation, increased public awareness and adverse publicity about potential impacts on climate change or environmental harm from us or our industry could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the Company adversely. In recent years, investors have also begun to show increased interest about sustainability and climate change as it relates to their investment decisions. In addition, increasing weather-related impacts on our operations and plant sites may impact the cost or availability of insurance. Furthermore, the potential impact of climate change and related regulation on our feedstock suppliers and customers is highly uncertain and there can be no assurance that it will not have an adverse effect on the availability over time of our traditional carbon black feedstocks, our customers’ businesses and sourcing arrangements, and on our financial condition and results of operations. For instance, lower demand for oil refinery products may reduce the availability and increase the cost of certain of the key raw materials we use. In addition, many of our tire customers have set sustainability goals for the 2030 to 2050 time period to purchase more sustainable raw materials, including reduced use of fossil-derived materials, which could reduce demand for our traditional carbon black products.Volatility in the price and availability of raw materials and energy could impact our margins and working capital and our revenues from our energy center operations.Our manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of energy and raw materials, the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond our control. Our carbon black businesses use a variety of feedstocks as raw material including high sulfur fuel oils, low sulfur fuel oils, coal tar distillates, and ethylene cracker residue, the cost and availability of which vary, based in part on geography. Significant movements or volatility in our carbon black feedstock costs could have an adverse effect on our working capital and results of operations. In addition, regulatory changes or geopolitical conflict may impact the availability and prices of our raw materials. For example, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has disrupted and may continue to disrupt the price and availability of natural gas in Europe.15Certain of our carbon black supply arrangements contain provisions that adjust prices to account for changes in relevant feedstock and natural gas price indices. We also attempt to offset the effects of increases in raw material and energy costs through selling price increases in our non-contract sales, productivity improvements and cost reduction efforts. Success in offsetting increased raw material and energy costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased raw material and energy costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales. If we are not able to fully offset the effects of increased raw material or energy costs, it could have a significant impact on our financial results. Rapid declines in energy prices and raw material costs can also negatively impact our financial results, as such changes can negatively affect the revenues we receive from our energy centers and yield improvement investments, and may negatively impact our contract pricing adjustments. In addition, we use a variety of feedstock indices in our supply arrangements to adjust our prices for changes in raw materials costs. Depending on feedstock markets and our choice of feedstocks, the indices we use in our supply arrangements may not precisely track our actual costs. This could result in an incongruity between our pricing adjustments and changes in our actual feedstock costs, which can affect our net working capital and our margins. Further, the timing of the implementation of any of these pricing adjustments may not precisely track our actual costs as reflected in our financial statements.In addition, we obtain certain of our raw materials from selected key suppliers. Although we typically maintain raw material inventory, if any sole source supplier of raw materials ceases supplying raw materials to us, or if any of our key suppliers is unable to meet its obligations under supply agreements with us on a timely basis or at an acceptable price, or at all, we may be forced to incur higher costs to obtain the necessary raw materials elsewhere or, in certain limited cases, may not be able to obtain the required raw materials.A significant adverse change in a customer relationship or the failure of a customer to perform its obligations under agreements with us could harm our business or cash flows.Our success in strengthening relationships and growing business with our largest customers and retaining their business over extended time periods is important to our future results. We have a group of key customers across our businesses that together represent a significant portion of our total net sales and operating revenues. The loss of any of our important customers, or a significant reduction in volumes sold to them, could adversely affect our results of operations until such business is replaced or any temporary disruption ends. Further, in our Reinforcement Materials segment we enter into supply arrangements with a number of key customers that typically have a duration of one year, which account for approximately two-thirds of our total reinforcing carbons volumes. Our success in negotiating the price and volume terms under these arrangements could have a material effect on our results. In addition, any deterioration in the financial condition of any of our customers that impairs our customers’ ability to make payments to us also could increase our uncollectible receivables and could affect our future results and financial condition.We are exposed to political or country risk inherent in doing business in some countries, including China.Sales outside of the U.S. constituted the majority of our revenues in fiscal 2022. We conduct business in several countries, including China, that have less stable legal systems and financial markets, and potentially more corrupt, or less predictable, business environments than the U.S. As set forth in Note T to our Consolidated Financial Statements, sales in China constituted approximately 25% of our revenues in fiscal 2022 and our property, plant and equipment located in China constituted approximately 25% of our total property, plant and equipment as of September 30, 2022. Our operations outside of the U.S., including in China, expose us to risks related to uncertain enforcement of laws by foreign governments as well as risks that foreign governmental entities will change applicable rules and regulations with minimal advance notice. These risks could result in a material change in our operations, which could negatively impact the value of our securities. Additionally, our operations in some countries, including China, are subject to the following risks: changes in the rate of economic growth; unsettled political or economic conditions; non-renewal of operating permits or licenses; possible expropriation or other governmental actions; corruption by government officials and other third parties; social unrest, war, terrorist activities or other armed conflict; confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; deprivation of contract rights; trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; restrictions or additional costs associated with repatriating cash; exchange controls; inflation; currency fluctuations and devaluation; political tension that could result in sanctions being imposed against our customers or suppliers in countries where sanctions have not been imposed in the past; the effect of global health, safety and environmental matters on economic conditions and market opportunities; and changes in financial policy and availability of credit.16For example, the Chinese government has, from time to time, curtailed manufacturing operations, with little or no notice, in industrial regions out of growing concern over air quality and in response to COVID-19 outbreaks. The timing and length of these curtailments are difficult to predict and, at times, are applied to manufacturing operations without regard to whether the operations being curtailed comply with environmental regulations in the area. Accordingly, our manufacturing operations in China have been subject to these curtailments in the past and will likely be subject to them in the future. In addition, the Chinese government has instituted energy intensity and energy consumption targets in a number of provinces in its efforts to reduce energy consumption, resulting in energy quotas and shortages in energy supply. We are unable to predict how any power outages related to these targets will impact our operations. These events could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows both during and after the period of any government-imposed curtailment or power outages affecting our operations. Further, any such curtailments on the operations at our customers’ facilities could reduce demand for our products and our volumes.Operational RisksAs a chemical manufacturing company, our operations are subject to operational risks and have the potential to cause environmental or other damage as well as personal injury, or disrupt our ability to supply our customers, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.The operation of a chemical manufacturing business as well as the sale and distribution of chemical products are subject to operational as well as safety, health and environmental risks. For example, the production and/or processing of carbon black, specialty compounds, fumed metal oxides, aerogel, carbon nanotubes, and other chemicals involve the handling, transportation, manufacture or use of certain substances or components that may be considered toxic or hazardous. While we take precautions to handle and transport these materials in a safe manner, if they are mishandled or released into the environment, they could cause property damage or result in personal injury claims against us.   Our manufacturing processes and the transportation of our chemical products and/or the raw materials used to manufacture our products are subject to risks inherent in chemical manufacturing, including leaks, fires, explosions, toxic releases, severe weather, mechanical failures or unscheduled downtime.  In addition, the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities, particularly at a facility that is the sole source of a particular product we manufacture, or a disruption in our supply chain or distribution operations may result in loss of production, which, in turn, may make it difficult for us to meet customer needs. For example, in recent years we have experienced unplanned plant outages at our plants in Franklin, Louisiana and Altamira, Mexico that caused reduced volumes and earnings during the period the plant was down and increased our fixed costs. Other disruptions in supply chains and distribution channels, including those caused by global or regional logistics delays and constraints, such as rail or other transportation interruptions, could disrupt our business operations. These events and their consequences could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows, both during and after the period of operational difficulties, and could harm our reputation.An interruption in our operations as a result of fence-line arrangements could disrupt our manufacturing operations and adversely affect our financial results.At certain of our fumed metal oxides facilities and one of our carbon black facilities in China we have fence-line arrangements with adjacent third party manufacturing operations (“fence-line partners”), who provide raw materials for our manufacturing operations and/or take by-products generated from our operations. Accordingly, any disruptions or curtailments in a fence-line partner’s production facilities that impacts their ability to supply us with raw materials or to take our manufacturing by-products could disrupt our manufacturing operations or cause us to incur increased operating costs to mitigate such disruption. We have experienced disruptions in the supply of raw materials from certain of our fence-line partners in recent years, which have caused us to curtail our operations or incur higher operating costs. Significant events at neighboring industrial facilities, such as environmental releases, could also disrupt our operations and result in negative publicity about us and harm our reputation.Our products are subject to extensive safety, health and environmental requirements, which could impair our ability to manufacture and sell certain products. In order to secure and maintain the right to produce or sell our products, we must satisfy product related regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions. Obtaining and maintaining these approvals requires a significant amount of product testing and data, and there is no certainty these approvals will be obtained. 17Certain national and international health organizations have classified carbon black as a possible or suspected human carcinogen. To the extent that, in the future, (i) these organizations re-classify carbon black as a known or confirmed carcinogen, (ii) other organizations or government authorities in other jurisdictions classify carbon black or any of our other finished products, raw materials or intermediates as suspected or known carcinogens or otherwise hazardous, or (iii) there is discovery of adverse health effects attributable to production or use of carbon black or any of our other finished products, raw materials or intermediates, we could be required to incur significantly higher costs to comply with environmental, health and safety laws, or to comply with restrictions on sales of our products, be subject to legal claims, and our reputation and business could be adversely affected. Further a subset of multi-walled carbon nanotubes that includes a carbon nanotube grade we currently manufacture have been classified as carcinogen category 1B and specific target organ toxicant (lung) after repeated exposure category 1 under European Union regulations. Although our carbon nanotubes are bound in a matrix or contained within conductive materials, exposure to carbon nanotubes could occur in the workplace. We could be required to incur additional costs to comply with requirements for the safe manufacturing and handling of these materials and we could be subject to legal claims associated with our products. In addition, chemicals that are currently classified as non-hazardous may be classified as hazardous in the future, and our products may have characteristics that are not recognized today but may be found in the future to impair human health or to be carcinogenic.Information technology systems failures, data security breaches, cybersecurity attacks or network disruptions could compromise our information, disrupt our operations and expose us to liability, which may adversely impact our operations.We rely on information technology, some of which is managed by third parties, to manage the day-to-day operations and activities of our business, operate elements of our manufacturing facilities, manage our customer and vendor transactions, and maintain our financial, accounting and business records. In addition, we collect and store certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations.The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this data is critical to our operations and business strategy. Information technology systems failures, including those associated with our managed service provider or related to upgrading our systems or integrating information technology and other systems in connection with the integration of businesses we acquire, or network disruptions could disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions and our financial reporting, and our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.In addition, our information technology systems could be compromised by outside parties intent on extracting information, corrupting information or disrupting business processes. Despite our security design and controls, and those of our third-party providers, we may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, security breaches, inadvertent or intentional employee actions, system failures and other risks that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data, improper use of our, or our third-party provider systems, solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, or operational disruptions. We face increased information technology security and fraud risks due to our increased reliance on working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond, which may create additional information security vulnerabilities and/or magnify the impact of any disruption in information technology systems. Additionally, we may be exposed to unauthorized access to our information technology systems through undetected vulnerabilities in our service providers’ information systems or software. With the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, the scope and impact of any information security incident cannot be predicted. In addition, the global regulatory environment pertaining to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with new and changing requirements, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, The Personal Information Protection Law of the People’s Republic of China, and Brazil’s Lei Geral de Protecao de Dados. Complying with these laws and regulations may be more costly or take longer than we anticipate, and any failure to comply could result in fines or penalties.Breaches of our security measures, cyber incidents and disruptions, or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential information about the Company, our employees, our vendors, or our customers, or failure to comply with laws and regulations related to information security or privacy, could result in legal claims or proceedings against us by governmental entities or individuals, significant fines, penalties and judgments, disruption of our operations, remediation requirements, changes to our business practices, and damage to our reputation, and could otherwise harm our business and our results of operations. Natural disasters and severe weather events could affect our operations and financial results.We operate facilities in areas of the world that are exposed to natural hazards, such as floods, windstorms, hurricanes, and earthquakes. In addition, extreme weather events and changing weather patterns present physical risks on existing infrastructure that may become more frequent or more severe as a result of factors related to climate change. Such events could disrupt our supply of raw materials or otherwise affect production, transportation and delivery of our products or affect demand for our products.18We have experienced recent disruptions of the type described above. For example, the severe flooding that occurred in Western Europe in July 2021 caused significant damage to our specialty compounds plant in Pepinster, Belgium. That disruption resulted in a near-term reduction in earnings from lower volumes and certain increases in our operating costs, not all of which we expect to be able to recover from our insurance. Financial and Other RisksNegative or uncertain worldwide or regional economic conditions or trade relations, as well as regional conflicts, may adversely impact our business.Our operations and performance are affected by worldwide and regional economic conditions. Uncertainty or a deterioration in the economic conditions affecting the businesses to which, or geographic areas in which, we sell products could reduce demand for our products and inflationary pressures may increase our costs. We may also experience pricing pressure on products and services, or be unsuccessful in passing along to our customers an increase in our raw materials costs or energy prices, which could decrease our revenues and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. In addition, during periods of economic uncertainty, our customers may temporarily pursue inventory reduction measures that exceed declines in the actual underlying demand. Regional conflicts may also adversely impact our business. While we do not have manufacturing operations in Russia or Ukraine, and we do not have material sales in Ukraine and have stopped sales into Russia, Russia’s continuing invasion of Ukraine is negatively impacting economic conditions in Europe.  This could reduce demand for our products in our EMEA region, and negatively impact our and our customers’ ability to operate plants in Europe, and harm our suppliers and otherwise increase our operating costs.In addition, changes in, or tensions relating to, U.S. trade relations with countries where we do business may adversely impact our business. For example, tensions in the U.S.-China trade relationship have led to an increased risk of sanctions being imposed against our suppliers and customers in China which, if imposed, could restrict our ability to do business with such companies. In addition, we may encounter unexpected operating difficulties in China, more restrictive investment opportunities in China, greater difficulty transferring funds, more restrictive travel in and out of China, or negative currency impacts. Further, the cost of our capital projects may be higher than anticipated because of trade tariffs. In addition, escalating tensions in the U.S.-China trade relationship and/or restrictive policies by either country could require us to duplicate the technology resources and capabilities we have in China, particularly those related to our battery materials product line, in a geography outside China, thereby increasing our costs.Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results.As more fully described in Note S in Item 8 below under the heading “Contingencies”, we are a party to or the subject of lawsuits, claims, and proceedings, including, but not limited to, those involving environmental, and health and safety matters as well as product liability and personal injury claims relating to asbestosis, silicosis, and coal worker’s pneumoconiosis. We are also a potentially responsible party in various environmental proceedings and remediation matters wherein substantial amounts are at issue. Adverse rulings, judgments or settlements in pending or future litigation (including liabilities associated with respirator claims) or in connection with environmental remediation activities could adversely affect our financial results or cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in any forward-looking statements. Our tax rate and other tax obligations are dependent upon a number of factors, a change in any of which could impact our future tax rates and financial results.Our future tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: changes in the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the estimated realization of our net deferred tax assets; the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for non-U.S. withholding taxes; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes; changes in available tax credits; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; and changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws. In addition, losses for which no tax benefits can be recorded could materially impact our tax rate and its volatility from one quarter to another.The Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”), enacted in the U.S. on August 16, 2022, imposes several new taxes that will be effective in 2023, including a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases.19Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates affect our financial results.We earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In fiscal 2022, we derived a majority of our revenues from sales outside the U.S. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in countries where we operate will affect our results of operations and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time. In addition, we are exposed to adverse changes in interest rates. We use a combination of commercial paper and borrowings under our Credit Agreements to meet our cash needs, with borrowings intra-quarter that may be higher than at quarter-end. As this debt is at variable interest rates, high interest rates environments, such as the current environment, increase our borrowing costs.  We manage both these risks through normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative instruments as well as foreign currency debt. We cannot be certain, however, that we will be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our operations and has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and any future outbreak of a widespread health epidemic could materially and adversely impact our business in the future.Our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases, such as the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus beginning in December 2019 (“COVID-19”). A global health crisis could have a serious adverse impact on the economy and on our business, results of operations and cash flows as the COVID-19 pandemic and associated containment efforts did in fiscal 2020. Specifically, a pandemic or future global health crisis may disrupt operations at our customers and reduce demand for our products, require or cause us to cease operations or idle production lines at our facilities, could materially affect our ability to adequately staff and maintain our operations, including in the event government authorities impose mandatory closures, such as those imposed in China as part of that country’s “Zero COVID” policy, work-from-home orders and social distancing protocols, and seek voluntary facility closures and impose other restrictions to mitigate the further spread of disease. A global health crisis could also disrupt our supply chain and materially and adversely impact our ability to secure supplies for our facilities and to provide personal protective equipment for our employees, which could materially and adversely affect our operations. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has also contributed to increased costs and decreased availability of labor and materials for construction projects, and these factors have increased the costs of our capital improvement projects and delayed our completion of such projects. There may also be long-term effects on our customers in, and the economies of, affected countries. Even if a virus or other illness does not spread significantly, the perceived risk of infection or health risk may materially affect our business. As we cannot predict the duration or scope of COVID-19 or any pandemic, the negative financial impact to our results cannot be reasonably estimated and could be material. Factors that will influence the impact on our business and operations include the duration and extent of the pandemic, including the virulence and spread of different strains of a virus and the level and timing of vaccine development and distribution across the world and their impact on economic recovery and growth, the extent of imposed or recommended containment and mitigation measures and their impact on our operations and the operations of our customers, and the general economic consequences of the pandemic. In addition, a global health crisis that continues for an extended period of time with an adverse impact on our revenue and overall profitability may lead to an increase in inventory reserves, allowances for doubtful accounts, and additional valuation allowances on certain of our deferred tax assets, or a reduction in our borrowing availability under our credit agreements, or cause us to recognize impairments for certain long-lived assets including goodwill, intangible assets or property, plant and equipment. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic or other widespread health epidemic adversely affected or affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks that could adversely affect our business described herein, such as risks associated with industry capacity utilization, volatility in the price and availability of raw materials, material adverse changes in customer relationships including any failure of a customer to perform its obligations under agreements with us, IT security systems risks, factors affecting our tax rate, and risks associated with worldwide or regional economic conditions.We have entered into a number of derivative contracts with financial counterparties. The effectiveness of these contracts is dependent on the ability of these financial counterparties to perform their obligations and their nonperformance could harm our financial condition.We have entered into forward foreign currency contracts and cross-currency swaps as part of our financial risk management strategy. The effectiveness of our risk management program using these instruments is dependent, in part, upon the counterparties to these contracts honoring their financial obligations. If any of our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations in the future, we could be exposed to increased earnings and cash flow volatility due to an instrument’s failure to hedge or adequately address a financial risk.20Technology RisksWe may not be successful achieving our growth expectations from new products, new applications and technology developments, and money we spend on these efforts may not result in an increase in revenues or profits commensurate with our investment.We may not be successful achieving our growth expectations from developing new products or product applications. Moreover, we cannot be certain that the costs we incur investing in new product and technology development will result in an increase in revenues or profits commensurate with our investment. For example, our investments to further develop our E2C™ solutions, inkjet dispersions and inks, and battery materials applications may not result in the earnings growth expectations on which these investments are being made. In addition, the timely commercialization of products that we are developing may be disrupted or delayed by manufacturing or other technical difficulties, market acceptance or insufficient market size to support a new product, competitors’ new products, and difficulties in moving from the experimental stage to the production stage. These disruptions or delays could affect our future business results.The continued protection of our patents, trade secrets and other proprietary intellectual property rights is important to our success.Our patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and competitive position. We own various patents and other intellectual property rights in the U.S. and other countries covering many of our products, as well as processes and product uses. Where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable, we rely on trade secret laws and practices to protect our proprietary technology and processes, such as physical security, limited dissemination and access and confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, consultants, business partners, potential licensees and others to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect and the protective measures we have put in place may not prevent disclosure or unauthorized use of our proprietary information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of misappropriation or other violations of our proprietary rights. In addition, we are a licensee of various patents and intellectual property rights belonging to others in the U.S. and other countries. Because the laws and enforcement mechanisms of some countries may not allow us to protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as we are able to do in the U.S., the strength of our intellectual property rights will vary from country to country.Irrespective of our proprietary intellectual property rights, we may be subject to claims that our products, processes or product uses infringe the intellectual property rights of others. These claims, even if they are without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend and if we were to lose such claims, we could be enjoined from selling our products or using our processes and/or be subject to damages, or be required to enter into licensing agreements requiring royalty payments and/or use restrictions. Licensing agreements may not be available to us, or if available, may not be available on acceptable terms.Portfolio Management, Capacity Expansion and Integration RisksAny failure to realize benefits from acquisitions, alliances or joint ventures or to achieve our portfolio management objectives could adversely affect future financial results. In achieving our strategic plan objectives, we may pursue acquisitions, alliances or joint ventures intended to complement or expand our existing businesses globally or add product technology, or both. The success of acquisitions of businesses, new technologies and products, or arrangements with third parties is not always predictable and we may not be successful in realizing our objectives as anticipated. We may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business results. In addition to strategic acquisitions we evaluate our portfolio in light of our objectives and alignment with our growth strategy. In implementing this strategy we may not be successful in separating non-strategic assets. The gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such assets may affect our earnings. Moreover, we have in the past, and may again in the future, incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce earnings. As described in Note D in Item 8 below under the heading “Divestitures”, we recorded an asset impairment charge and a loss on sale of business in fiscal 2022 in connection with the disposition of our Purification Solutions business.21Plant capacity expansions and site development projects may impact existing plant operations, be delayed and/or not achieve the expected benefits.Our ability to complete capacity expansions and site development projects, including capacity conversions from reinforcing carbons to specialty carbons and other site development projects, as planned may be delayed or interrupted by the need to obtain environmental and other regulatory approvals, unexpected cost increases, availability of labor and materials, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. These risks include the risk that existing plant operations are disrupted, which could make it difficult for us to meet our customer needs. Moreover, in the case of capacity expansions, the cost of these activities could have a negative impact on the financial performance of the relevant business until capacity utilization at the particular facility is sufficient to absorb the incremental costs associated with an expansion. In addition, our ability to expand capacity in emerging regions depends in part on economic and political conditions in these regions and, in some cases, on our ability to establish operations, construct additional manufacturing capacity or form strategic business alliances"
8,CBT,CABOT CORP,2021-11-29,"Risk Factors
In addition to factors described elsewhere in this report, the following are important factors that could adversely affect our business. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations and financial results.COVID-19 Pandemic RiskThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our operations and has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and any future outbreak of a widespread health epidemic could materially and adversely impact our business in the future.Our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases, such as the current outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”). The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated containment efforts have had a serious adverse impact on the economy and on our business, results of operations and cash flows. Specifically, during fiscal 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted operations at our key customers within the automotive and tire industries, which materially reduced demand for our products. The deterioration of earnings we experienced from the COVID-19 pandemic was one of the factors that contributed to our recording of a valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, as described in Note R in Item 8 below under the heading “Income Taxes”. In response to reduced demand for our products, and also to comply with government mandates, during portions of fiscal 2020 we temporarily ceased operations or idled production lines at our facilities and we may be required to do this in the future. In addition, the current pandemic, or any future global health crisis, could materially affect our ability to adequately staff and maintain our operations, including in the event government authorities impose mandatory closures, work-from-home orders and social distancing protocols, and seek voluntary facility closures and impose other restrictions to mitigate the further spread of disease. A global health crisis could also disrupt our supply chain and materially and adversely impact our ability to secure supplies for our facilities and to provide personal protective equipment for our employees, which could materially and adversely affect our operations. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic is having a negative impact on the cost and availability of global transportation and on the availability of semi-conductor chips for the automotive industry. It has also contributed to increased costs and decreased availability of labor and materials for construction projects, and these factors have increased the costs of our capital improvement projects and delayed our completion of such projects. There may also be long-term effects on our customers in, and the economies of, affected countries. Even if a virus or other illness does not spread significantly, the perceived risk of infection or health risk may materially affect our business. Any of the foregoing within the countries in which we or our customers and suppliers operate could severely disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. As we cannot predict the duration or scope of COVID-19 or any pandemic, the negative financial impact to our results cannot be reasonably estimated and could be material. Factors that will influence the impact on our business and operations include the duration and extent of the pandemic, including the virulence and spread of different strains of a virus and the level and timing of vaccine development and distribution across the world and their impact on economic recovery and growth, the extent of imposed or 14recommended containment and mitigation measures and their impact on our operations and the operations of our customers, and the general economic consequences of the pandemic. In addition, a global health crisis that continues for an extended period of time with an adverse impact on our revenue and overall profitability may lead to an increase in inventory reserves, allowances for doubtful accounts, and additional valuation allowances on certain of our deferred tax assets, or a reduction in our borrowing availability under our credit agreements, or cause us to recognize impairments for certain long-lived assets including goodwill, intangible assets or property, plant and equipment. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic or other widespread health epidemic adversely affected or affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks that could adversely affect our business described below, such as risks associated with industry capacity utilization, volatility in the price and availability of raw materials, material adverse changes in customer relationships including any failure of a customer to perform its obligations under agreements with us, IT security systems risks, factors affecting our tax rate, and risks associated with worldwide or regional economic conditions.Industry RisksIndustry capacity utilization and competition from other specialty chemical companies may adversely impact our business.Our businesses are sensitive to industry capacity utilization, and pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur, which could affect our financial performance. Further, we operate in a highly competitive marketplace. Our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize new and innovative, high value-added products for existing and future customers. Increased competition from existing or newly developed products offered by our competitors or companies whose products offer a similar functionality as our products, particularly those with an improved environmental footprint, and could be substituted for our products, may negatively affect demand for our products. In addition, actions by our competitors could impair our ability to maintain or raise prices, successfully enter new markets or maintain or grow our market position.Environmental regulations and restrictions that affect the carbon black industry impose constraints on our operations, and could threaten our competitive position and increase our operating costs, which may adversely impact our business and results of operations.Our ongoing carbon black operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to environmental matters, many of which provide for substantial monetary fines and criminal sanctions for violations. These include requirements to obtain and comply with various environmental-related and other permits for constructing any new facilities and operating all of our existing facilities. These environmental regulatory requirements and restrictions impose constraints on our operations, and could threaten our competitive position. We have expended and will continue to expend considerable amounts to construct, maintain, operate, and improve our facilities around the world for environmental protection.Further, environmental agencies worldwide are increasingly implementing regulations and other requirements resulting in more restrictive air emission limits globally, particularly as they relate to nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter emissions. We expect complying with existing regulations and other regulatory and tax changes being proposed in regions where we operate, if approved, will require us to incur significant additional costs for compliance, capital improvements or limit our current or planned operations. We may not be able to offset the effects of these compliance costs through price increases. Our ability to implement price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased regulatory costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales.A description of these matters is included in the discussion under the heading “Safety, Health, Environment, and Sustainability” in Item 1 above, and in Note T in Item 8 below under the heading “Contingencies”).We may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change developments and an increased focus on carbon neutrality, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations, and increased pressures and adverse publicity about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation.Carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, is emitted in carbon black manufacturing processes. Concerns about the relationship between greenhouse gases and global climate change, and an increased focus on carbon neutrality, may result in additional regulations on both national and supranational levels, to monitor, regulate, control and tax emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Climate changes include extreme weather impacts, such as changes in rainfall and in storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, significantly changing sea levels and increasing atmospheric and water temperatures. A number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to climate change, including regulating greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, in certain geographic areas, our carbon black and activated carbon facilities are or may become subject to greenhouse gas emission trading schemes or carbon tax programs under which we may be required to pay any incurred taxes or purchase emission credits if our emission levels exceed our free allocation. The outcome of new legislation or 15regulation in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional requirements and fees or restrictions on certain activities. Compliance with greenhouse gas and climate change initiatives may result in additional costs to us, including, among other things, increased production costs, increased feedstock costs, additional taxes, reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on production or operations, particularly as they may relate to our carbon black business. We may not be able to offset the effects of these new or more stringent laws and regulations and compliance costs through price increases, which could adversely affect our business and negatively impact our growth. Our ability to implement price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased regulatory costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales. Any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. Even without such regulation, increased public awareness and adverse publicity about potential impacts on climate change or environmental harm from us or our industry could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the Company adversely. In recent years, investors have also begun to show increased interest about sustainability and climate change as it relates to their investment decisions. In addition, increasing weather-related impacts on our operations and plant sites may impact the cost or availability of insurance. Furthermore, the potential impact of climate change and related regulation on our feedstock suppliers and customers is highly uncertain and there can be no assurance that it will not have an adverse effect on the availability over time of our traditional carbon black feedstocks, our customers’ businesses, and on our financial condition and results of operations.Volatility in the price and availability of raw materials and energy could impact our margins and working capital.Our manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of energy and raw materials, the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond our control. Our carbon black businesses use a variety of feedstocks as raw material including high sulfur fuel oils, low sulfur fuel oils, coal tar distillates, and ethylene cracker residue, the cost and availability of which vary, based in part on geography. Significant movements or volatility in our carbon black feedstock costs could have an adverse effect on our working capital and results of operations. In addition, regulatory changes may impact the prices of our feedstocks. For example, the International Maritime Organization regulation known as MARPOL further restricted the sulfur emissions for the shipping industry beginning January 1, 2020. This has impacted the prices and could impact the availability of certain fuel oils we use as feedstock for our products.Certain of our carbon black supply arrangements contain provisions that adjust prices to account for changes in relevant feedstock and natural gas price indices. We also attempt to offset the effects of increases in raw material and energy costs through selling price increases in our non-contract sales, productivity improvements and cost reduction efforts. Success in offsetting increased raw material and energy costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased raw material and energy costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales. If we are not able to fully offset the effects of increased raw material or energy costs, it could have a significant impact on our financial results. Rapid declines in energy and raw material costs can also negatively impact our financial results, as such changes can negatively affect the returns we receive on our energy centers and yield improvement investments, and may negatively impact our contract pricing adjustments. In addition, we use a variety of feedstock indices in our supply arrangements to adjust our prices for changes in raw materials costs. Depending on feedstock markets and our choice of feedstocks, the indices we use in our supply arrangements may not precisely track our actual costs. This could result in an incongruity between our pricing adjustments and changes in our actual feedstock costs, which can affect our net working capital and our margins. Further, the timing of the implementation of any of these pricing adjustments may not precisely track our actual costs as reflected in our financial statements.In addition, we obtain certain of our raw materials from selected key suppliers. Although we typically maintain raw material inventory, if any sole source supplier of raw materials ceases supplying raw materials to us, or if any of our key suppliers is unable to meet its obligations under supply agreements with us on a timely basis or at an acceptable price, or at all, we may be forced to incur higher costs to obtain the necessary raw materials elsewhere or, in certain limited cases, may not be able to obtain the required raw materials.16A significant adverse change in a customer relationship or the failure of a customer to perform its obligations under agreements with us could harm our business or cash flows.Our success in strengthening relationships and growing business with our largest customers and retaining their business over extended time periods is important to our future results. We have a group of key customers across our businesses that together represent a significant portion of our total net sales and operating revenues. The loss of any of our important customers, or a significant reduction in volumes sold to them, could adversely affect our results of operations until such business is replaced or any temporary disruption ends. Further, in our Reinforcement Materials segment we enter into supply arrangements with a number of key customers that typically have a duration of one year, which account for approximately half of our total rubber blacks volumes. Our success in negotiating the price and volume terms under these arrangements could have a material effect on our results. In addition, any deterioration in the financial condition of any of our customers that impairs our customers’ ability to make payments to us also could increase our uncollectible receivables and could affect our future results and financial condition.We are exposed to political or country risk inherent in doing business in some countries.Sales outside of the U.S. constituted the majority of our revenues in fiscal 2021. We conduct business in several countries that have less stable legal systems and financial markets, and potentially more corrupt business environments than the U.S. Our operations in some countries are subject to the following risks: changes in the rate of economic growth; unsettled political or economic conditions; non-renewal of operating permits or licenses; possible expropriation or other governmental actions; corruption by government officials and other third parties; social unrest, war, terrorist activities or other armed conflict; confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; deprivation of contract rights; trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; restrictions or additional costs associated with repatriating cash; exchange controls; inflation; currency fluctuations and devaluation; political tension that could result in sanctions being imposed against our customers or suppliers in countries where sanctions have not been imposed in the past; the effect of global health, safety and environmental matters on economic conditions and market opportunities; and changes in financial policy and availability of credit. The Chinese government has, from time to time, curtailed manufacturing operations, with little or no notice, in industrial regions out of growing concern over air quality. The timing and length of these curtailments are difficult to predict and, at times, are applied to manufacturing operations without regard to whether the operations being curtailed comply with environmental regulations in the area. Accordingly, our manufacturing operations in China have been subject to these curtailments in the past and will likely be subject to them in the future. In addition, the Chinese government has instituted energy intensity and energy consumption targets in a number of provinces in its efforts to reduce energy consumption, resulting in energy quotas and shortages in energy supply. We are unable to predict how any power outages related to these targets will impact our operations. These events could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows both during and after the period of any government-imposed curtailment or power outages affecting our operations. Further, any such curtailments on the operations at our customers’ facilities could reduce demand for our products and our volumes.Operational RisksAs a chemical manufacturing company, our operations are subject to operational risks and have the potential to cause environmental or other damage as well as personal injury, or disrupt our ability to supply our customers, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.The operation of a chemical manufacturing business as well as the sale and distribution of chemical products are subject to operational as well as safety, health and environmental risks. For example, the production and/or processing of carbon black, specialty compounds, fumed metal oxides, aerogel, activated carbon and other chemicals involve the handling, transportation, manufacture or use of certain substances or components that may be considered toxic or hazardous. Our manufacturing processes and the transportation of our chemical products and/or the raw materials used to manufacture our products are subject to risks inherent in chemical manufacturing, including leaks, fires, explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures or unscheduled downtime. For example, in fiscal 2021, we experienced an unplanned plant outage at our plant in Canal, Louisiana that caused reduced volumes and earnings during the period the plant was down and increased our fixed costs. In addition, the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities, particularly at a facility that is the sole source of a particular product we manufacture, or a disruption in our supply chain or distribution operations may result in loss of production, which, in turn, may make it difficult for us to meet customer needs. Accordingly, these events and their consequences could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows, both during and after the period of operational difficulties, and could harm our reputation.17An interruption in our operations as a result of fence-line arrangements could disrupt our manufacturing operations and adversely affect our financial results.At certain of our fumed metal oxides facilities and one of our carbon black facilities in China we have fence-line arrangements with adjacent third party manufacturing operations (“fence-line partners”), who provide raw materials for our manufacturing operations and/or take by-products generated from our operations. Accordingly, any disruptions or curtailments in a fence-line partner’s production facilities that impacts their ability to supply us with raw materials or to take our manufacturing by-products could disrupt our manufacturing operations or cause us to incur increased operating costs to mitigate such disruption. We have experienced disruptions in the supply of raw materials from certain of our fence-line partners in recent years, which have caused us to curtail our operations or incur higher operating costs. Significant events at neighboring industrial facilities, such as environmental releases, could also disrupt our operations and result in negative publicity about us and harm our reputation.Our products are subject to extensive safety, health and environmental requirements, which could impair our ability to manufacture and sell certain products. In order to secure and maintain the right to produce or sell our products, we must satisfy product related regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions. Obtaining and maintaining these approvals requires a significant amount of product testing and data, and there is no certainty these approvals will be obtained. Certain national and international health organizations have classified carbon black as a possible or suspected human carcinogen. To the extent that, in the future, (i) these organizations re-classify carbon black as a known or confirmed carcinogen, (ii) other organizations or government authorities in other jurisdictions classify carbon black or any of our other finished products, raw materials or intermediates as suspected or known carcinogens or otherwise hazardous, or (iii) there is discovery of adverse health effects attributable to production or use of carbon black or any of our other finished products, raw materials or intermediates, we could be required to incur significantly higher costs to comply with environmental, health and safety laws, or to comply with restrictions on sales of our products, be subject to legal claims, and our reputation and business could be adversely affected. In addition, chemicals that are currently classified as non-hazardous may be classified as hazardous in the future, and our products may have characteristics that are not recognized today but may be found in the future to impair human health or to be carcinogenic.Information technology systems failures, data security breaches, cybersecurity attacks or network disruptions could compromise our information, disrupt our operations and expose us to liability, which may adversely impact our operations.We rely on information technology, some of which is managed by third parties, to manage the day-to-day operations and activities of our business, operate elements of our manufacturing facilities, manage our customer and vendor transactions, and maintain our financial, accounting and business records. In addition, we collect and store certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations.The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this data is critical to our operations and business strategy. Information technology systems failures, including those associated with upgrading our systems or integrating information technology and other systems in connection with the integration of businesses we acquire, or network disruptions could disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions and our financial reporting, and our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, our information technology systems could be compromised by outside parties intent on extracting information, corrupting information or disrupting business processes. Despite our security design and controls, and those of our third-party providers, we may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, security breaches, inadvertent or intentional employee actions, system failures and other risks that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data, improper use of our, or our third-party provider systems, solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, or operational disruptions. We face increased information technology security and fraud risks due to our increased reliance on working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond, which may create additional information security vulnerabilities and/or magnify the impact of any disruption in information technology systems. Additionally, we may be exposed to unauthorized access to our information technology systems through undetected vulnerabilities in our service providers’ information systems or software. With the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, the scope and impact of any information security incident cannot be predicted. In addition, the global regulatory environment pertaining to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with new and changing requirements, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the China Cybersecurity Law, and Brazil’s Lei Geral de Protecao de Dados (LGPD). Complying with these laws and regulations may be more costly or take longer than we anticipate and could otherwise affect our business operations.18 Breaches of our security measures, cyber incidents and disruptions, or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential information about the Company, our employees, our vendors, or our customers, or failure to comply with laws and regulations related to information security or privacy, could result in legal claims or proceedings against us by governmental entities or individuals, significant fines, penalties and judgments, disruption of our operations, remediation requirements, changes to our business practices, and damage to our reputation, and could otherwise harm our business and our results of operations. Natural disasters and severe weather events could affect our operations and financial results.We operate facilities in areas of the world that are exposed to natural hazards, such as floods, windstorms, hurricanes, and earthquakes. In addition, extreme weather events and changing weather patterns present physical risks on existing infrastructure that may become more frequent or more severe as a result of factors related to climate change. Such events could disrupt our supply of raw materials or otherwise affect production, transportation and delivery of our products or affect demand for our products.We have experienced recent disruptions of the type described above. For example, the severe flooding that occurred in Western Europe in July 2021 caused significant damage to our Specialty Compounds plant in Pepinster, Belgium. This disruption has resulted in a near-term reduction in earnings from lower volumes and certain increases in our operating costs, not all of which we expect to be able to recover from our insurance. Technology RisksWe may not be successful achieving our growth expectations from new products, new applications and technology developments, and money we spend on these efforts may not result in an increase in revenues or profits commensurate with our investment.We may not be successful achieving our growth expectations from developing new products or product applications. Moreover, we cannot be certain that the costs we incur investing in new product and technology development will result in an increase in revenues or profits commensurate with our investment. For example, our investments to further develop our E2C™ solutions and battery materials applications may not result in the earnings growth expectations on which these investments are being made. In addition, the timely commercialization of products that we are developing may be disrupted or delayed by manufacturing or other technical difficulties, market acceptance or insufficient market size to support a new product, competitors’ new products, and difficulties in moving from the experimental stage to the production stage. These disruptions or delays could affect our future business results.The continued protection of our patents, trade secrets and other proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success.Our patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and competitive position. We own various patents and other intellectual property rights in the U.S. and other countries covering many of our products, as well as processes and product uses. Where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable, we rely on trade secret laws and practices to protect our proprietary technology and processes, such as physical security, limited dissemination and access and confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, consultants, business partners, potential licensees and others to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect and the protective measures we have put in place may not prevent disclosure or unauthorized use of our proprietary information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of misappropriation or other violations of our proprietary rights. In addition, we are a licensee of various patents and intellectual property rights belonging to others in the U.S. and other countries. Because the laws and enforcement mechanisms of some countries may not allow us to protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as we are able to do in the U.S., the strength of our intellectual property rights will vary from country to country.Irrespective of our proprietary intellectual property rights, we may be subject to claims that our products, processes or product uses infringe the intellectual property rights of others. These claims, even if they are without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend and if we were to lose such claims, we could be enjoined from selling our products or using our processes and/or be subject to damages, or be required to enter into licensing agreements requiring royalty payments and/or use restrictions. Licensing agreements may not be available to us, or if available, may not be available on acceptable terms.Portfolio Management, Capacity Expansion and Integration RisksAny failure to realize benefits from acquisitions, alliances or joint ventures or to achieve our portfolio management objectives could adversely affect future financial results. In achieving our strategic plan objectives, we may pursue acquisitions, alliances or joint ventures intended to complement or expand our existing businesses globally or add product technology, or both. The success of acquisitions of businesses, new technologies and products, or arrangements with third parties is not always predictable and we may not be successful in realizing 19our objectives as anticipated. We may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business results. In addition to strategic acquisitions we evaluate our portfolio in light of our objectives and alignment with our growth strategy. In implementing this strategy we may not be successful in separating non-strategic assets. The gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such assets may affect our earnings. Moreover, we have in the past, and may again in the future, incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce earnings. As described in Item 9B, “Other Information”, below, we expect to record an asset impairment charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 in connection with the disposition of our Purification Solutions business.Plant capacity expansions and site development projects may impact existing plant operations, be delayed and/or not achieve the expected benefits.Our ability to complete capacity expansions and site development projects, including capacity conversions from rubber carbon black to specialty carbon black and other site development projects, as planned may be delayed or interrupted by the need to obtain environmental and other regulatory approvals, unexpected cost increases, availability of labor and materials, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. These risks include the risk that existing plant operations are disrupted, which could make it difficult for us to meet our customer needs. Moreover, in the case of capacity expansions, the cost of these activities could have a negative impact on the financial performance of the relevant business until capacity utilization at the particular facility is sufficient to absorb the incremental costs associated with an expansion. In addition, our ability to expand capacity in emerging regions depends in part on economic and political conditions in these regions and, in some cases, on our ability to establish operations, construct additional manufacturing capacity or form strategic business alliances.Financial RisksNegative or uncertain worldwide or regional economic conditions or trade relations may adversely impact our business.Our operations and performance are affected by worldwide and regional economic conditions. Uncertainty or a deterioration in the economic conditions affecting the businesses to which, or geographic areas in which, we sell products could reduce demand for our products. We may also experience pricing pressure on products and services, which could decrease our revenues and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. In addition, during periods of economic uncertainty, our customers may temporarily pursue inventory reduction measures that exceed declines in the actual underlying demand. In addition, changes in, or tensions relating to, U.S. trade relations with countries where we do business may adversely impact our business. For example, tensions in the U.S.-China trade relationship have led to an increase in the risk of sanctions being imposed against our suppliers and customers in China which, if imposed, could restrict our ability to do business with such companies. In addition, further trade tensions between the countries could have further adverse implications on our businesses and operating results in both the U.S. and China. For instance, we may encounter unexpected operating difficulties in China, more restrictive investment opportunities in China, greater difficulty transferring funds, more restrictive travel in and out of China, or negative currency impacts. Further, the cost of our capital projects may be higher than anticipated because of these trade tariffs.Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results.As more fully described in Note T in Item 8 below under the heading “Contingencies”, we are a party to or the subject of lawsuits, claims, and proceedings, including, but not limited to, those involving environmental, and health and safety matters as well as product liability and personal injury claims relating to asbestosis, silicosis, and coal worker’s pneumoconiosis. We are also a potentially responsible party in various environmental proceedings and remediation matters wherein substantial amounts are at issue. Adverse rulings, judgments or settlements in pending or future litigation (including liabilities associated with respirator claims) or in connection with environmental remediation activities could adversely affect our financial results or cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in any forward-looking statements. Our tax rate is dependent upon a number of factors, a change in any of which could impact our future tax rates and net income.Our future tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: changes in the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the estimated realization of our net deferred tax assets; the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for non-U.S. withholding taxes; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes; changes in available tax credits; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; and changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws. In addition, losses for which no tax benefits can be recorded could materially impact our tax rate and its volatility from one quarter to another.20Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates affect our financial results.We earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In fiscal 2021, we derived a majority of our revenues from sales outside the U.S. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in countries where we operate will affect our results of operations and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time. In addition, we are exposed to adverse changes in interest rates. We manage both these risks through normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative instruments as well as foreign currency debt. We cannot be certain, however, that we will be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.Further, we have exposure to foreign currency movements because certain foreign currency transactions need to be converted to a different currency for settlement. These conversions can have a direct impact on our cash flows.We have entered into a number of derivative contracts with financial counterparties. The effectiveness of these contracts is dependent on the ability of these financial counterparties to perform their obligations and their nonperformance could harm our financial condition.We have entered into forward foreign currency contracts and cross-currency swaps as part of our financial risk management strategy. The effectiveness of our risk management program using these instruments is dependent, in part, upon the counterparties to these contracts honoring their financial obligations. If any of our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations in the future, we could be exposed to increased earnings and cash flow volatility due to an instrument’s failure to hedge or adequately address a financial risk"
14,CBT,CABOT CORP,2020-11-25,"Risk Factors
In addition to factors described elsewhere in this report, the following are important factors that could adversely affect our business. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations and financial results.COVID-19 Pandemic RiskThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our operations and has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and any future outbreak of a widespread health epidemic could materially and adversely impact our business in the future.Our business has been and could in the future be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of a widespread health epidemic. The coronavirus (or COVID-19) pandemic and the associated containment efforts have had a serious adverse impact on the economy and on our business, results of operations and cash flows. Specifically, during fiscal 2020,the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted operations at our key customers within the automotive and tire industries, which materially reduced demand for our products. The deterioration of earnings we experienced from the COVID-19 pandemic was one of the factors that contributed to our recording of a valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, as described in Note S in Item 8 below under the heading “Income Taxes”. In response to reduced demand for our products, and also to comply with government mandates, during portions of fiscal 2020 we temporarily ceased operations or idled production lines at our facilities and we may be required to do this in the future.  In addition, the current pandemic, or any future global health crisis, could materially affect our ability to adequately staff and maintain our operations, including in the event government authorities impose mandatory closures, work-from-home orders and social distancing protocols, and seek voluntary facility closures and impose other restrictions to mitigate the further spread of disease.  A global health crisis could also disrupt our supply chain and materially and adversely impact our ability to secure supplies for our facilities and to provide personal protective equipment for our employees, which could materially and adversely affect our operations.  There may also be long-term effects on our customers in, and the economies of, affected countries. Even if a virus or other illness does not spread significantly, the perceived risk of infection or health risk may materially affect our business. Any of the foregoing within the countries in which we or our customers and suppliers operate could severely disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. As we cannot predict the duration or scope of COVID-19 or any pandemic, the negative financial impact to our results cannot be reasonably estimated and could be material. Factors that will influence the impact on our business and operations include the duration and extent of the pandemic, the extent of imposed or recommended containment and mitigation measures and their impact on our operations and the operations of our customers, and the general economic consequences of the pandemic. In addition, a global health crisis that continues for an extended period of time with an adverse impact on our revenue and overall profitability may lead to an increase in inventory reserves, allowances for doubtful accounts, and additional valuation allowances on certain of our deferred tax assets, or a reduction in our borrowing availability under our credit agreements, or cause us to recognize impairments for certain long-lived assets including goodwill, intangible assets or property, plant and equipment. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks that could adversely affect our business described below, such as risks associated with industry capacity utilization, volatility in the price and availability of raw materials, material adverse changes in customer relationships including any failure of a customer to perform its obligations under agreements with us, IT security systems risks, factors affecting our tax rate, and risks associated with worldwide or regional economic conditions.11Industry RisksIndustry capacity utilization and competition from other specialty chemical companies may adversely impact our business.Our businesses are sensitive to industry capacity utilization, and pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur, which could affect our financial performance. Further, we operate in a highly competitive marketplace. Our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize new and innovative, high value-added products for existing and future customers. Increased competition from existing or newly developed products offered by our competitors or companies whose products offer a similar functionality as our products and could be substituted for our products, may negatively affect demand for our products. In addition, actions by our competitors could impair our ability to maintain or raise prices, successfully enter new markets or maintain or grow our market position.Environmental regulations and restrictions that affect the carbon black industry impose constraints on our operations, and could threaten our competitive position and increase our operating costs, which may adversely impact our business and results of operations.Our ongoing carbon black operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to environmental matters, many of which provide for substantial monetary fines and criminal sanctions for violations. These include requirements to obtain and comply with various environmental-related and other permits for constructing any new facilities and operating all of our existing facilities. These environmental regulatory requirements and restrictions impose constraints on our operations, and could threaten our competitive position. We have expended and will continue to expend considerable amounts to construct, maintain, operate, and improve our facilities around the world for environmental protection. A description of these costs is included in the discussion under the heading “Safety, Health, Environment, and Sustainability” in Item 1 above, under the heading “Legal Proceedings” in Item 3 below and in Note U in Item 8 below under the heading “Contingencies”).Further, environmental agencies worldwide are increasingly implementing regulations and other requirements resulting in more restrictive air emission limits globally, particularly as they relate to nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide and particulate matter emissions. In addition, in certain geographic areas, our carbon black and activated carbon facilities are or may become subject to greenhouse gas emission trading schemes or carbon tax programs under which we may be required to pay any incurred taxes or purchase emission credits if our emission levels exceed our free allocation. Based on regulatory and tax programs currently in effect associated with greenhouse gas emissions, in fiscal 2020, we spent approximately $1 million to purchase emission allowances or pay taxes in Europe, China and Canada.  We expect complying with regulations in Ontario, Canada that apply to our plant in Sarnia, as well as a number of regulatory and tax changes being proposed in other regions where we operate, if approved, will require us to incur significant additional costs for compliance, capital improvements or limit our current or planned operations. We may not be able to offset the effects of these compliance costs through price increases. Our ability to implement price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased regulatory costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales.Volatility in the price and availability of raw materials and energy could impact our margins and working capital.Our manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of energy and raw materials, the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond our control. Our carbon black businesses use a variety of feedstocks as raw material including high sulfur fuel oils, low sulfur fuel oils, coal tar distillates, and ethylene cracker residue, the cost and availability of which vary, based in part on geography. Significant movements or volatility in our carbon black feedstock costs could have an adverse effect on our working capital and results of operations. In addition, regulatory changes may impact the prices of our feedstocks. For example, the International Maritime Organization regulation known as MARPOL further restricted the sulfur emissions for the shipping industry beginning January 1, 2020. This has impacted the prices and could impact the availability of certain fuel oils we use as feedstock for our products. 12Certain of our carbon black supply arrangements contain provisions that adjust prices to account for changes in relevant feedstock and natural gas price indices. We also attempt to offset the effects of increases in raw material and energy costs through selling price increases in our non-contract sales, productivity improvements and cost reduction efforts. Success in offsetting increased raw material and energy costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased raw material and energy costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales. If we are not able to fully offset the effects of increased raw material or energy costs, it could have a significant impact on our financial results. Rapid declines in energy and raw material costs can also negatively impact our financial results, as such changes can negatively affect the returns we receive on our energy centers and yield improvement investments, and may negatively impact our contract pricing adjustments. In addition, we use a variety of feedstock indices in our supply arrangements to adjust our prices for changes in raw materials costs. Depending on feedstock markets and our choice of feedstocks, the indices we use in our supply arrangements may not precisely track our actual costs. This could result in an incongruity between our pricing adjustments and changes in our actual feedstock costs, which can affect our margins.In addition, we obtain certain of our raw materials from selected key suppliers. Although we maintain raw material inventory, if any sole source supplier of raw materials ceases supplying raw materials to us, or if any of our key suppliers is unable to meet its obligations under supply agreements with us on a timely basis or at an acceptable price, or at all, we may be forced to incur higher costs to obtain the necessary raw materials elsewhere or, in certain limited cases, may not be able to obtain the required raw materials.A significant adverse change in a customer relationship or the failure of a customer to perform its obligations under agreements with us could harm our business or cash flows.Our success in strengthening relationships and growing business with our largest customers and retaining their business over extended time periods is important to our future results. We have a group of key customers across our businesses that together represent a significant portion of our total net sales and operating revenues. The loss of any of our important customers, or a significant reduction in volumes sold to them, could adversely affect our results of operations until such business is replaced or any temporary disruption ends. Further, in our Reinforcement Materials segment we enter into supply arrangements with a number of key customers that typically have a duration of one year, which account for approximately half of our total rubber blacks volumes. Our success in negotiating the price and volume terms under these arrangements could have a material effect on our results. In addition, any deterioration in the financial condition of any of our customers that impairs our customers’ ability to make payments to us also could increase our uncollectible receivables and could affect our future results and financial condition.We are exposed to political or country risk inherent in doing business in some countries.Sales outside of the U.S. constituted the majority of our revenues in fiscal 2020. We conduct business in several countries that have less stable legal systems and financial markets, and potentially more corrupt business environments than the U.S. Our operations in some countries are subject to the following risks: changes in the rate of economic growth; unsettled political or economic conditions; non-renewal of operating permits or licenses; possible expropriation or other governmental actions; corruption by government officials and other third parties; social unrest, war, terrorist activities or other armed conflict; confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; deprivation of contract rights; trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; restrictions or additional costs associated with repatriating cash; exchange controls; inflation; currency fluctuations and devaluation; political tension that could result in sanctions being imposed against our customers or suppliers in countries where sanctions have not been imposed in the past; the effect of global health, safety and environmental matters on economic conditions and market opportunities; and changes in financial policy and availability of credit. The Chinese government has, from time to time, curtailed manufacturing operations, with little or no notice, in industrial regions out of growing concern over air quality. The timing and length of these curtailments are difficult to predict and, at times, are applied to manufacturing operations without regard to whether the operations being curtailed comply with environmental regulations in the area. Accordingly, our manufacturing operations in China have been subject to these curtailments in the past and may be in the future. These events could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows both during and after the period of any curtailment affecting our operations.13Operational RisksAs a chemical manufacturing company, our operations are subject to operational risks and have the potential to cause environmental or other damage as well as personal injury, or disrupt our ability to supply our customers, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.The operation of a chemical manufacturing business as well as the sale and distribution of chemical products are subject to operational as well as safety, health and environmental risks. For example, the production and/or processing of carbon black, specialty compounds, fumed metal oxides, aerogel, activated carbon and other chemicals involve the handling, transportation, manufacture or use of certain substances or components that may be considered toxic or hazardous. Our manufacturing processes and the transportation of our chemical products and/or the raw materials used to manufacture our products are subject to risks inherent in chemical manufacturing, including leaks, fires, explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures or unscheduled downtime. In addition, the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities, particularly at a facility that is the sole source of a particular product we manufacture, or a disruption in our supply chain or distribution operations may result in loss of production, which, in turn, may make it difficult for us to meet customer needs. Accordingly, these events and their consequences could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows, both during and after the period of operational difficulties, and could harm our reputation.An interruption in our operations as a result of fence-line arrangements could disrupt our manufacturing operations and adversely affect our financial results.At certain of our facilities we have fence-line arrangements with adjacent third party manufacturing operations (“fence-line partners”), who provide raw materials for our manufacturing operations and/or take by-products generated from our operations. Accordingly, any disruptions or curtailments in a fence-line partner’s production facilities that impacts their ability to supply us with raw materials or to take our manufacturing by-products could disrupt our manufacturing operations or cause us to incur increased operating costs to mitigate such disruption.Our products are subject to extensive safety, health and environmental requirements, which could impair our ability to manufacture and sell certain products. In order to secure and maintain the right to produce or sell our products, we must satisfy product related regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions. Obtaining and maintaining these approvals requires a significant amount of product testing and data, and there is no certainty these approvals will be obtained. Certain national and international health organizations have classified carbon black as a possible or suspected human carcinogen. To the extent that, in the future, (i) these organizations re-classify carbon black as a known or confirmed carcinogen, (ii) other organizations or government authorities in other jurisdictions classify carbon black or any of our other finished products, raw materials or intermediates as suspected or known carcinogens or otherwise hazardous, or (iii) there is discovery of adverse health effects attributable to production or use of carbon black or any of our other finished products, raw materials or intermediates, we could be required to incur significantly higher costs to comply with environmental, health and safety laws, or to comply with restrictions on sales of our products, be subject to legal claims, and our reputation and business could be adversely affected. In addition, chemicals that are currently classified as non-hazardous may be classified as hazardous in the future, and our products may have characteristics that are not recognized today but may be found in the future to impair human health or to be carcinogenic.14Information technology systems failures, data security breaches or network disruptions could compromise our information, disrupt our operations and expose us to liability, which may adversely impact our operations.In the ordinary course of our business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and certain information of our customers, suppliers, business partners, and employees in our information technology systems. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this data is critical to our operations. Information technology systems failures, including risks associated with upgrading our systems or in successfully integrating information technology and other systems in connection with the integration of businesses we acquire, network disruptions or unauthorized access could disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions and our financial reporting, and our ability to protect our customer or company information, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, as with all enterprise information systems, our information technology systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information, corrupting information, or disrupting business processes. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential information about the Company, our employees, our vendors, or our customers, could result in legal claims or proceedings and potential liability for us, and damage to our reputation, and could otherwise harm our business and our results of operations.Natural disasters could affect our operations and financial results.We operate facilities in areas of the world that are exposed to natural hazards, such as floods, windstorms, hurricanes, and earthquakes. Extreme weather events present physical risks that may become more frequent or more severe as a result of factors related to climate change. Such events could disrupt our supply of raw materials or otherwise affect production, transportation and delivery of our products or affect demand for our products.Technology RisksWe may not be successful achieving our growth expectations from new products, new applications and technology developments, and money we spend on these efforts may not result in an increase in revenues or profits commensurate with our investment.We may not be successful achieving our growth expectations from developing new products or product applications. Moreover, we cannot be certain that the costs we incur investing in new product and technology development will result in an increase in revenues or profits commensurate with our investment. For example, our investments to further develop our E2C™ solutions and energy materials applications may not result in the earnings growth expectations on which these investments are being made. In addition, the timely commercialization of products that we are developing may be disrupted or delayed by manufacturing or other technical difficulties, market acceptance or insufficient market size to support a new product, competitors’ new products, and difficulties in moving from the experimental stage to the production stage. These disruptions or delays could affect our future business results.The continued protection of our patents, trade secrets and other proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success.Our patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and competitive position. We own various patents and other intellectual property rights in the U.S. and other countries covering many of our products, as well as processes and product uses. Where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable, we rely on trade secret laws and practices to protect our proprietary technology and processes, such as physical security, limited dissemination and access and confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, consultants, business partners, potential licensees and others to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect and the protective measures we have put in place may not prevent disclosure or unauthorized use of our proprietary information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of misappropriation or other violations of our proprietary rights. In addition, we are a licensee of various patents and intellectual property rights belonging to others in the U.S. and other countries. Because the laws and enforcement mechanisms of some countries may not allow us to protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as we are able to do in the U.S., the strength of our intellectual property rights will vary from country to country.Irrespective of our proprietary intellectual property rights, we may be subject to claims that our products, processes or product uses infringe the intellectual property rights of others. These claims, even if they are without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend and if we were to lose such claims, we could be enjoined from selling our products or using our processes and/or be subject to damages, or be required to enter into licensing agreements requiring royalty payments and/or use restrictions. Licensing agreements may not be available to us, or if available, may not be available on acceptable terms.15Portfolio Management, Capacity Expansion and Integration RisksAny failure to realize benefits from acquisitions, alliances or joint ventures or to achieve our portfolio management objectives could adversely affect future financial results. In achieving our strategic plan objectives, we may pursue acquisitions, alliances or joint ventures intended to complement or expand our existing businesses globally or add product technology, or both. The success of acquisitions of businesses, new technologies and products, or arrangements with third parties is not always predictable and we may not be successful in realizing our objectives as anticipated. We may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business results. In addition to strategic acquisitions we evaluate our portfolio in light of our objectives and alignment with our growth strategy. In implementing this strategy we may not be successful in separating non-strategic assets. The gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such assets may affect our earnings. Moreover, we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce earnings, as was the case when we disposed of our Specialty Fluids business and our lignite mine in Marshall, Texas. Plant capacity expansions and site development projects may impact existing plant operations, be delayed and/or not achieve the expected benefits.Our ability to complete capacity expansions and site development projects as planned may be delayed or interrupted by the need to obtain environmental and other regulatory approvals, unexpected cost increases, availability of labor and materials, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. These risks include the risk that existing plant operations are disrupted, which could make it difficult for us to meet our customer needs. Moreover, in the case of capacity expansions, the cost of these activities could have a negative impact on the financial performance of the relevant business until capacity utilization at the particular facility is sufficient to absorb the incremental costs associated with an expansion. In addition, our ability to expand capacity in emerging regions depends in part on economic and political conditions in these regions and, in some cases, on our ability to establish operations, construct additional manufacturing capacity or form strategic business alliances.Financial RisksNegative or uncertain worldwide or regional economic conditions or trade relations may adversely impact our business.Our operations and performance are affected by worldwide and regional economic conditions. Uncertainty or a deterioration in the economic conditions affecting the businesses to which, or geographic areas in which, we sell products could reduce demand for our products. We may also experience pricing pressure on products and services, which could decrease our revenues and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. In addition, during periods of economic uncertainty, our customers may temporarily pursue inventory reduction measures that exceed declines in the actual underlying demand. In addition, changes in, or tensions relating to, U.S. trade relations with countries where we do business may adversely impact our business. For example, recent tensions in the U.S.-China trade relationship led to the implementation by both countries of higher tariffs on imported goods from the other. It also increased the risk of sanctions being imposed against our suppliers and customers in China which, if imposed, could restrict our ability to do business with such companies. The uncertainty created by these trade tensions negatively affected the buying behavior of our customers, lowering industry demand and creating a more competitive pricing environment for our products. In addition, further trade tensions between the countries could have further adverse implications on our businesses and operating results in both the U.S. and China. For instance, we may encounter unexpected operating difficulties in China, more restrictive investment opportunities in China, greater difficulty transferring funds, or negative currency impacts. Further, the cost of our capital projects may be higher than anticipated because of these trade tariffs.Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results.As more fully described in “Legal Proceedings” in Item 3 below and in Note U in Item 8 below, under the heading “Contingencies”, we are a party to or the subject of lawsuits, claims, and proceedings, including, but not limited to, those involving environmental, and health and safety matters as well as product liability and personal injury claims relating to asbestosis, silicosis, and coal worker’s pneumoconiosis. We are also a potentially responsible party in various environmental proceedings and remediation matters wherein substantial amounts are at issue. Adverse rulings, judgments or settlements in pending or future litigation (including liabilities associated with respirator claims) or in connection with environmental remediation activities could adversely affect our financial results or cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in any forward-looking statements. 16Our tax rate is dependent upon a number of factors, a change in any of which could impact our future tax rates and net income.Our future tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: changes in the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the estimated realization of our net deferred tax assets; the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for non-U.S. withholding taxes; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes; changes in available tax credits; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; and changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws. In addition, losses for which no tax benefits can be recorded could materially impact our tax rate and its volatility from one quarter to another.Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates affect our financial results.We earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In fiscal 2020, we derived a majority of our revenues from sales outside the U.S. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in countries where we operate will affect our results of operations and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time. In addition, we are exposed to adverse changes in interest rates. We manage both these risks through normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative instruments as well as foreign currency debt. We cannot be certain, however, that we will be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.Further, we have exposure to foreign currency movements because certain foreign currency transactions need to be converted to a different currency for settlement. These conversions can have a direct impact on our cash flows.We have entered into a number of derivative contracts with financial counterparties. The effectiveness of these contracts is dependent on the ability of these financial counterparties to perform their obligations and their nonperformance could harm our financial condition.We have entered into forward foreign currency contracts and cross-currency swaps as part of our financial risk management strategy. The effectiveness of our risk management program using these instruments is dependent, in part, upon the counterparties to these contracts honoring their financial obligations. If any of our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations in the future, we could be exposed to increased earnings and cash flow volatility due to an instrument’s failure to hedge or adequately address a financial risk"
0,CBT,CABOT CORP,2019-11-22,"Risk Factors
In addition to factors described elsewhere in this report, the following are important factors that could adversely affect our business. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations and financial results.Industry RisksIndustry capacity utilization and competition from other specialty chemical companies may adversely impact our business.Our businesses are sensitive to industry capacity utilization, and pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur, which could affect our financial performance. Further, we operate in a highly competitive marketplace. Our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize new and innovative, high value-added products for existing and future customers. Increased competition from existing or newly developed products offered by our competitors or companies whose products offer a similar functionality as our products and could be substituted for our products, may negatively affect demand for our products. In addition, actions by our competitors could impair our ability to maintain or raise prices, successfully enter new markets or maintain or grow our market position.Volatility in the price and availability of raw materials and energy could impact our margins and working capital.Our manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of energy and raw materials, the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond our control. Our carbon black businesses use a variety of feedstocks as raw material including high sulfur fuel oils, low sulfur fuel oils, coal tar distillates, and ethylene cracker residue, the cost and availability of which vary, based in part on geography. Significant movements or volatility in our carbon black feedstock costs could have an adverse effect on our working capital and results of operations. In addition, regulatory changes may impact the prices of our feedstocks. For example, the International Maritime Organization regulation known as MARPOL will further restrict the sulfur emissions for the shipping industry beginning January 1, 2020. This has impacted the prices and could impact the availability of certain fuel oils we use as feedstock for our products. 10Certain of our carbon black supply arrangements contain provisions that adjust prices to account for changes in relevant feedstock and natural gas price indices. We also attempt to offset the effects of increases in raw material and energy costs through selling price increases in our non-contract sales, productivity improvements and cost reduction efforts. Success in offsetting increased raw material and energy costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased raw material and energy costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales. If we are not able to fully offset the effects of increased raw material or energy costs, it could have a significant impact on our financial results. Rapid declines in energy and raw material costs can also negatively impact our financial results, as such changes can negatively affect the returns we receive on our energy centers and yield improvement investments, and may negatively impact our contract pricing adjustments. In addition, we use a variety of feedstock indices in our supply arrangements to adjust our prices for changes in raw materials costs. Depending on feedstock markets and our choice of feedstocks, the indices we use in our supply arrangements may not precisely track our actual costs. This could result in an incongruity between our pricing adjustments and changes in our actual feedstock costs, which can affect our margins.In addition, we obtain certain of our raw materials from selected key suppliers. Although we maintain raw material inventory, if any of these suppliers is unable to meet its obligations under supply agreements with us on a timely basis or at an acceptable price, or at all, we may be forced to incur higher costs to obtain the necessary raw materials elsewhere or, in certain limited cases, may not be able to obtain the required raw materials.A significant adverse change in a customer relationship or the failure of a customer to perform its obligations under agreements with us could harm our business or cash flows.Our success in strengthening relationships and growing business with our largest customers and retaining their business over extended time periods is important to our future results. We have a group of key customers across our businesses that together represent a significant portion of our total net sales and operating revenues. The loss of any of our important customers, or a significant reduction in volumes sold to them, could adversely affect our results of operations until such business is replaced or any temporary disruption ends. Further, in our Reinforcement Materials segment we enter into supply arrangements with a number of key customers that typically have a duration of one year, which account for approximately half of our total rubber blacks volumes. Our success in negotiating the price and volume terms under these arrangements could have a material effect on our results. In addition, any deterioration in the financial condition of any of our customers that impairs our customers’ ability to make payments to us also could increase our uncollectible receivables and could affect our future results and financial condition.We are exposed to political or country risk inherent in doing business in some countries.Sales outside of the U.S. constituted a majority of our revenues in fiscal 2019. We conduct business in several countries that have less stable legal systems and financial markets, and potentially more corrupt business environments than the U.S. Our operations in some countries are subject to the following risks: changes in the rate of economic growth; unsettled political or economic conditions; non-renewal of operating permits or licenses; possible expropriation or other governmental actions; corruption by government officials and other third parties; social unrest, war, terrorist activities or other armed conflict; confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; deprivation of contract rights; trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; restrictions or additional costs associated with repatriating cash; exchange controls; inflation; currency fluctuations and devaluation; the effect of global health, safety and environmental matters on economic conditions and market opportunities; and changes in financial policy and availability of credit. 11The Chinese government has, from time to time, curtailed manufacturing operations, without notice, in industrial regions out of growing concern over air quality. The timing and length of these curtailments are difficult to predict and, at times, are applied to manufacturing operations without regard to whether the operations being curtailed comply with environmental regulations in the area. Accordingly, our manufacturing operations in China may be subject to these curtailments. These events could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows both during and after the period of any curtailment affecting our operations.Operational RisksOur operations and products are subject to extensive safety, health and environmental requirements, which could increase our costs and/or impair our ability to manufacture and sell certain products. Our ongoing operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety, health and environmental matters, many of which provide for substantial monetary fines and criminal sanctions for violations. These include requirements to obtain and comply with various environmental-related and other permits for constructing any new facilities and operating all of our existing facilities. Environmental regulatory changes and restrictions could impose constraints on our operations, and threaten our competitive position. In addition, in certain geographic areas, our carbon black and activated carbon facilities are or may become subject to greenhouse gas emission trading schemes or carbon tax programs under which we may be required to pay any incurred taxes or purchase emission credits if our emission levels exceed our free allocation. Costs of complying with regulations could increase as concerns related to greenhouse gases and climate change continue to emerge. The enactment of new environmental laws and regulations and/or the more aggressive interpretation of existing requirements could require us to incur significant costs for compliance or capital improvements or limit our current or planned operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow. (See “Legal Proceedings” in Item 3 below). We attempt to offset the effects of these compliance costs through price increases, productivity improvements and cost reduction efforts. Success in offsetting any such increased regulatory costs is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased regulatory costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales. In order to secure and maintain the right to produce or sell our products, we must satisfy product related regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions. Obtaining and maintaining these approvals requires a significant amount of product testing and data, and there is no certainty these approvals will be obtained. Certain national and international health organizations have classified carbon black as a possible or suspected human carcinogen. To the extent that, in the future, (i) these organizations re-classify carbon black as a known or confirmed carcinogen, (ii) other organizations or government authorities in other jurisdictions classify carbon black or any of our other finished products, raw materials or intermediates as suspected or known carcinogens or otherwise hazardous, or (iii) there is discovery of adverse health effects attributable to production or use of carbon black or any of our other finished products, raw materials or intermediates, we could be required to incur significantly higher costs to comply with environmental, health and safety laws, or to comply with restrictions on sales of our products, be subject to legal claims, and our reputation and business could be adversely affected. In addition, chemicals that are currently classified as non-hazardous may be classified as hazardous in the future, and our products may have characteristics that are not recognized today but may be found in the future to impair human health or to be carcinogenic.12As a chemical manufacturing company, our operations are subject to operational risks and have the potential to cause environmental or other damage as well as personal injury, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.The operation of a chemical manufacturing business as well as the sale and distribution of chemical products are subject to operational as well as safety, health and environmental risks. For example, the production and/or processing of carbon black, specialty compounds, fumed metal oxides, aerogel, activated carbon and other chemicals involve the handling, transportation, manufacture or use of certain substances or components that may be considered toxic or hazardous. Our manufacturing processes and the transportation of our chemical products and/or the raw materials used to manufacture our products are subject to risks inherent in chemical manufacturing, including leaks, fires, explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures or unscheduled downtime. In addition, at our lignite mine, we have operational risks associated with the maintenance and operation of the heavy equipment required to dig and haul the lignite, and risks relating to lower than expected lignite quality or recovery rates. If operational risks materialize, they could result in injury or loss of life, damage to the environment, or damage to property, including mineral properties. In addition, the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities or a disruption in our supply chain or distribution operations may result in loss of production, which, in turn, may make it difficult for us to meet customer needs. Accordingly, these events and their consequences could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows, both during and after the period of operational difficulties, and could harm our reputation.An interruption in our operations as a result of fence-line arrangements could disrupt our manufacturing operations and adversely affect our financial results.At certain of our facilities we have fence-line arrangements with adjacent third party manufacturing operations (“fence-line partners”), who provide raw materials for our manufacturing operations and/or take by-products generated from our operations. Accordingly, any disruptions or curtailments in a fence-line partner’s production facilities that impacts their ability to supply us with raw materials or to take our manufacturing by-products could disrupt our manufacturing operations or cause us to incur increased operating costs to mitigate such disruption.Information technology systems failures, data security breaches or network disruptions could compromise our information, disrupt our operations and expose us to liability, which may adversely impact our operations.In the ordinary course of our business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and certain information of our customers, suppliers, business partners, and employees in our information technology systems. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this data is critical to our operations. Information technology systems failures, including risks associated with upgrading our systems or in successfully integrating information technology and other systems in connection with the integration of businesses we acquire, network disruptions or unauthorized access could disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions and our financial reporting, and our ability to protect our customer or company information, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, as with all enterprise information systems, our information technology systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information, corrupting information, or disrupting business processes. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential information about the Company, our employees, our vendors, or our customers, could result in legal claims or proceedings and potential liability for us, and damage to our reputation, and could otherwise harm our business and our results of operations.Natural disasters could affect our operations and financial results.We operate facilities in areas of the world that are exposed to natural hazards, such as floods, windstorms, hurricanes, and earthquakes. Extreme weather events present physical risks that may become more frequent as a result of factors related to climate change. Such events could disrupt our supply of raw materials or otherwise affect production, transportation and delivery of our products or affect demand for our products.13Technology RisksWe may not be successful achieving our growth expectations from new products, new applications and technology developments, and money we spend on these efforts may not result in an increase in revenues or profits commensurate with our investment.We may not be successful achieving our growth expectations from developing new products or product applications. Moreover, we cannot be certain that the costs we incur investing in new product and technology development will result in an increase in revenues or profits commensurate with our investment. In addition, the timely commercialization of products that we are developing may be disrupted or delayed by manufacturing or other technical difficulties, market acceptance or insufficient market size to support a new product, competitors’ new products, and difficulties in moving from the experimental stage to the production stage. These disruptions or delays could affect our future business results.The continued protection of our patents, trade secrets and other proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success.Our patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and competitive position. We own various patents and other intellectual property rights in the U.S. and other countries covering many of our products, as well as processes and product uses. Where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable, we rely on trade secret laws and practices to protect our proprietary technology and processes, such as physical security, limited dissemination and access and confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, consultants, business partners, potential licensees and others to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect and the protective measures we have put in place may not prevent disclosure or unauthorized use of our proprietary information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of misappropriation or other violations of our proprietary rights. In addition, we are a licensee of various patents and intellectual property rights belonging to others in the U.S. and other countries. Because the laws and enforcement mechanisms of some countries may not allow us to protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as we are able to do in the U.S., the strength of our intellectual property rights will vary from country to country.Irrespective of our proprietary intellectual property rights, we may be subject to claims that our products, processes or product uses infringe the intellectual property rights of others. These claims, even if they are without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend and if we were to lose such claims, we could be enjoined from selling our products or using our processes and/or be subject to damages, or be required to enter into licensing agreements requiring royalty payments and/or use restrictions. Licensing agreements may not be available to us, or if available, may not be available on acceptable terms.Portfolio Management, Capacity Expansion and Integration RisksAny failure to realize benefits from acquisitions, alliances or joint ventures or to achieve our portfolio management objectives could adversely affect future financial results. In achieving our strategic plan objectives, we may pursue acquisitions, alliances or joint ventures intended to complement or expand our existing businesses globally or add product technology, or both. The success of acquisitions of businesses, new technologies and products, or arrangements with third parties is not always predictable and we may not be successful in realizing our objectives as anticipated. We may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business results. In addition to strategic acquisitions we evaluate our portfolio in light of our objectives and alignment with our growth strategy. In implementing this strategy we may not be successful in separating non-strategic assets. The gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such assets may affect our earnings. Moreover, we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce earnings.Plant capacity expansions and site development projects may impact existing plant operations, be delayed and/or not achieve the expected benefits.Our ability to complete capacity expansions and site development projects as planned may be delayed or interrupted by the need to obtain environmental and other regulatory approvals, unexpected cost increases, availability of labor and materials, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. These risks include the risk that existing plant operations are disrupted, which could make it difficult for us to meet our customer needs. Moreover, in the case of capacity expansions, the cost of these activities could have a negative impact on the financial performance of the relevant business until capacity utilization at the particular facility is sufficient to absorb the incremental costs associated with an expansion. In addition, our ability to expand capacity in emerging regions depends in part on economic and political conditions in these regions and, in some cases, on our ability to establish operations, construct additional manufacturing capacity or form strategic business alliances.14Financial RisksNegative or uncertain worldwide or regional economic conditions or trade relations may adversely impact our business.Our operations and performance are affected by worldwide and regional economic conditions. Uncertainty or a deterioration in the economic conditions affecting the businesses to which, or geographic areas in which, we sell products could reduce demand for our products. We may also experience pricing pressure on products and services, which could decrease our revenues and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. In addition, during periods of economic uncertainty, our customers may temporarily pursue inventory reduction measures that exceed declines in the actual underlying demand. In addition, changes in, or tensions relating to, U.S. trade relations with countries where we do business may adversely impact our business. For example, current tensions in the U.S.-China trade relationship have led to the implementation by both countries of higher tariffs on imported goods from the other. The uncertainty created by these trade tensions has negatively affected the buying behavior of our customers, lowering industry demand and creating a more competitive pricing environment for our products. If there is no satisfactory progress on trade negotiations between the countries, there could be further adverse implications on our businesses and operating results in both the U.S. and China. For instance, we may encounter unexpected operating difficulties in China, more restrictive investment opportunities in China, greater difficulty transferring funds, or negative currency impacts. Further, the cost of our capital projects may be higher than anticipated because of these trade tariffs.Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results.As more fully described in “Legal Proceedings” in Item 3 below, we are a party to or the subject of lawsuits, claims, and proceedings, including, but not limited to, those involving environmental, and health and safety matters as well as product liability and personal injury claims relating to asbestosis, silicosis, and coal worker’s pneumoconiosis. We are also a potentially responsible party in various environmental proceedings and remediation matters wherein substantial amounts are at issue. Adverse rulings, judgments or settlements in pending or future litigation (including liabilities associated with respirator claims) or in connection with environmental remediation activities could adversely affect our financial results or cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in any forward-looking statements. Our tax rate is dependent upon a number of factors, a change in any of which could impact our future tax rates and net income.Our future tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: changes in the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the estimated realization of our net deferred tax assets; the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for non-U.S. withholding taxes; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes; changes in available tax credits; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; and changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws. For example, we expect recent changes in tax rates in Switzerland will increase our tax rate going forward. In addition, losses for which no tax benefits can be recorded could materially impact our tax rate and its volatility from one quarter to another.Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates affect our financial results.We earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In fiscal 2019, we derived a majority of our revenues from sales outside the U.S. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in countries where we operate will affect our results of operations and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time. In addition, we are exposed to adverse changes in interest rates. We manage both these risks through normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative instruments as well as foreign currency debt. We cannot be certain, however, that we will be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.Further, we have exposure to foreign currency movements because certain foreign currency transactions need to be converted to a different currency for settlement. These conversions can have a direct impact on our cash flows.15We have entered into a number of derivative contracts with financial counterparties. The effectiveness of these contracts is dependent on the ability of these financial counterparties to perform their obligations and their nonperformance could harm our financial condition.We have entered into forward foreign currency contracts and cross-currency swaps as part of our financial risk management strategy. The effectiveness of our risk management program using these instruments is dependent, in part, upon the counterparties to these contracts honoring their financial obligations. If any of our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations in the future, we could be exposed to increased earnings and cash flow volatility due to an instrument’s failure to hedge or adequately address a financial risk. "

In addition to factors described elsewhere in this report, the following are important factors that could adversely affect our business. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations and financial results.Negative or uncertain worldwide or regional economic conditions or trade relations may adversely impact our business.Our operations and performance are affected by worldwide and regional economic conditions. Uncertainty or a deterioration in the economic conditions affecting the businesses to which, or geographic areas in which, we sell products could reduce demand for our products. We may also experience pricing pressure on products and services, which could decrease our revenues and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. In addition, during periods of economic uncertainty, our customers may temporarily pursue inventory reduction measures that exceed declines in the actual underlying demand. Our businesses are sensitive to industry capacity utilization, particularly Reinforcement Materials and Purification Solutions. As a result, pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur, which could affect our financial performance.10In addition, current tensions in the U.S.-China trade relationship have led to the implementation by both countries of higher tariffs on imported goods from the other. If there is no satisfactory progress on trade negotiations between the countries, there could be adverse implications on our businesses and operating results in both the U.S. and China if, as a result, we encounter unexpected operating difficulties in China, more restrictive investment opportunities in China, greater difficulty transferring funds, or negative currency impacts. Further, the cost of our capital projects may be higher than anticipated because of these trade tariffs.As the U.K. has committed to a withdrawal from the EU, the future structure of trade between the U.K. and the rest of Europe is uncertain. We have production facilities within the U.K. that supply customers in the EU and customers within the U.K. that are supplied by production facilities in the EU and any future tariffs or other disruptions to these trade flows could negatively impact our business. As a chemical manufacturing company, our operations are subject to operational risks and have the potential to cause environmental or other damage as well as personal injury, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.The operation of a chemical manufacturing business as well as the sale and distribution of chemical products are subject to operational as well as safety, health and environmental risks. For example, the production and/or processing of carbon black, specialty compounds, fumed metal oxides, aerogel, activated carbon and other chemicals involve the handling, transportation, manufacture or use of certain substances or components that may be considered toxic or hazardous. Our manufacturing processes and the transportation of our chemical products and/or the raw materials used to manufacture our products are subject to risks inherent in chemical manufacturing, including leaks, fires, explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures or unscheduled downtime. If operational risks materialize, they could result in injury or loss of life, damage to the environment, or damage to property. In addition, the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities or a disruption in our supply chain or distribution operations may result in loss of production, which, in turn, may make it difficult for us to meet customer needs. Accordingly, these events and their consequences could negatively impact the Company’s results of operations and cash flows, both during and after the period of operational difficulties, and could harm our reputation.A significant adverse change in a customer relationship or the failure of a customer to perform its obligations under agreements with us could harm our business or cash flows.Our success in strengthening relationships and growing business with our largest customers and retaining their business over extended time periods is important to our future results. We have a group of key customers across our businesses that together represent a significant portion of our total net sales and operating revenues. The loss of any of our important customers, or a significant reduction in volumes sold to them, could adversely affect our results of operations until such business is replaced or any temporary disruption ends. Further, in our Reinforcement Materials segment we enter into supply arrangements with a number of key customers, that have a duration of at least one year, which account for approximately half of our total rubber blacks volumes. Our success in negotiating the price and volume terms under these arrangements could have a material effect on our results. In addition, any deterioration in the financial condition of any of our customers that impairs our customers’ ability to make payments to us also could increase our uncollectible receivables and could affect our future results and financial condition.Volatility in the price and availability of raw materials and energy could impact our margins and working capital.Our manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of energy and raw materials, the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond our control. Our carbon black businesses use a variety of feedstocks as raw material including high sulfur fuel oils, low sulfur fuel oils, coal tar distillates, and ethylene cracker residue, the cost and availability of which vary, based in part on geography. Significant movements or volatility in our carbon black feedstock costs could have an adverse effect on our working capital and results of operations. In addition, regulatory changes may impact the prices of our feedstocks. For example, the International Maritime Organization regulation known as MARPOL will restrict the type of marine fuels that can be used for the shipping industry beginning January 1, 2020, which may impact the prices and availability of the feedstocks we purchase. Certain of our carbon black supply arrangements contain provisions that adjust prices to account for changes in relevant feedstock and natural gas price indices. We also attempt to offset the effects of increases in raw material and energy costs through selling price increases in our non-contract sales, productivity improvements and cost reduction efforts. Success in offsetting increased raw material and energy costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased raw material and energy costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales. If we are not able to fully offset the effects of increased raw material or energy costs, it could have a significant impact on our financial results. Rapid declines in energy and raw material costs can also negatively impact our financial results, as such changes can negatively affect the returns we receive on our energy centers and yield improvement investments, and may negatively impact our contract pricing adjustments. In addition, we use a variety of feedstock indices in our supply arrangements to adjust our prices for changes in raw materials costs. Depending on feedstock markets and our choice of feedstocks, the indices we use in our supply arrangements may not precisely track our actual costs. This could result in an incongruity between our pricing adjustments and changes in our actual feedstock costs, which can affect our margins.11In addition, we obtain certain of our raw materials from selected key suppliers. Although we maintain raw material inventory, if any of these suppliers is unable to meet its obligations under supply agreements with us on a timely basis or at all, we may be forced to incur higher costs to obtain the necessary raw materials elsewhere or, in certain limited cases, may not be able to obtain the required raw materials.We may not be successful achieving our growth expectations from new products, new applications and technology developments, and money we spend on these efforts may not result in a proportional increase in our revenues or profits.We may not be successful achieving our growth expectations from developing new products or product applications. Moreover, we cannot be certain that the costs we incur investing in new product and technology development will result in a proportional increase in our revenues or profits. In addition, the timely commercialization of products that we are developing may be disrupted or delayed by manufacturing or other technical difficulties, market acceptance or insufficient market size to support a new product, competitors’ new products, and difficulties in moving from the experimental stage to the production stage. These disruptions or delays could affect our future business results.Information technology systems failures, data security breaches or network disruptions could compromise our information, disrupt our operations and expose us to liability, which may adversely impact our operations.In the ordinary course of our business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and certain information of our customers, suppliers, business partners, and employees in our information technology systems. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this data is critical to our operations. Information technology systems failures, including risks associated with upgrading our systems or in successfully integrating information technology and other systems in connection with the integration of businesses we acquire, network disruptions or unauthorized access could disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions and our financial reporting, and our ability to protect our customer or company information, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, as with all enterprise information systems, our information technology systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information, corrupting information, or disrupting business processes. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential information about the Company, our employees, our vendors, or our customers, could result in legal claims or proceedings and potential liability for us, and damage to our reputation, and could otherwise harm our business and our results of operations.Any failure to realize benefits from acquisitions, alliances or joint ventures could adversely affect future financial results. In achieving our strategic plan objectives, we may pursue acquisitions, alliances or joint ventures intended to complement or expand our existing businesses globally or add product technology, or both. The success of acquisitions of businesses, new technologies and products, or arrangements with third parties is not always predictable and we may not be successful in realizing our objectives as anticipated. We may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business results.Plant capacity expansions and site development projects may impact existing plant operations, be delayed and/or not achieve the expected benefits.Our ability to complete capacity expansions and site development projects as planned may be delayed or interrupted by the need to obtain environmental and other regulatory approvals, unexpected cost increases, availability of labor and materials, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. These risks include the risk that existing plant operations are disrupted, which could make it difficult for us to meet our customer needs. Moreover, in the case of capacity expansions, the cost of these activities could have a negative impact on the financial performance of the relevant business until capacity utilization at the particular facility is sufficient to absorb the incremental costs associated with an expansion. In addition, our ability to expand capacity in emerging regions depends in part on economic and political conditions in these regions and, in some cases, on our ability to establish operations, construct additional manufacturing capacity or form strategic business alliances.An interruption in our operations as a result of fence-line arrangements could disrupt our manufacturing operations and adversely affect our financial results.At certain of our facilities we have fence-line arrangements with adjacent third party manufacturing operations (“fence-line partners”), who provide raw materials for our manufacturing operations and/or take by-products generated from our operations. Accordingly, any disruptions or curtailments in a fence-line partner’s production facilities that impacts their ability to supply us with raw materials or to take our manufacturing by-products could disrupt our manufacturing operations or cause us to incur increased operating costs to mitigate such disruption.12We are exposed to political or country risk inherent in doing business in some countries.Sales outside of the U.S. constituted a majority of our revenues in fiscal 2018. We conduct business in several countries that have less stable legal systems and financial markets, and potentially more corrupt business environments than the U.S. Our operations in some countries are subject to the following risks: changes in the rate of economic growth; unsettled political or economic conditions; non-renewal of operating permits or licenses; possible expropriation or other governmental actions; corruption by government officials and other third parties; social unrest, war, terrorist activities or other armed conflict; confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; deprivation of contract rights; trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; restrictions or additional costs associated with repatriating cash; exchange controls; inflation; currency fluctuations and devaluation; the effect of global health, safety and environmental matters on economic conditions and market opportunities; and changes in financial policy and availability of credit. The Chinese government has, from time to time, curtailed manufacturing operations, without notice, in industrial regions out of growing concern over air quality. The timing and length of these curtailments are difficult to predict and, at times, are applied to manufacturing operations without regard to whether the operations being curtailed comply with environmental regulations in the area. Accordingly, although we believe our operations are in compliance with applicable regulations, our manufacturing operations in China may be subject to these curtailments. These events could negatively impact the Company’s results of operations and cash flows both during and after the period of any curtailment affecting the Company’s operations.We face competition from other specialty chemical companies.We operate in a highly competitive marketplace. Our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize new and innovative, high value-added products for existing and future customers. Increased competition from existing or newly developed products offered by our competitors or companies whose products offer a similar functionality as our products and could be substituted for our products, may negatively affect demand for our products. In addition, actions by our competitors could impair our ability to maintain or raise prices, successfully enter new markets or maintain or grow our market position.Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results.As more fully described in “Legal Proceedings” in Item 3 below, we are a party to or the subject of lawsuits, claims, and proceedings, including, but not limited to, those involving environmental, and health and safety matters as well as product liability and personal injury claims relating to asbestosis, silicosis, and coal worker’s pneumoconiosis. We are also a potentially responsible party in various environmental proceedings and remediation matters wherein substantial amounts are at issue. Adverse rulings, judgments or settlements in pending or future litigation (including liabilities associated with respirator claims) or in connection with environmental remediation activities could adversely affect our financial results or cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in any forward-looking statements. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates affect our financial results.We earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In fiscal 2018, we derived a majority of our revenues from sales outside the U.S. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in countries where we operate will affect our results of operations and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time. In addition, we are exposed to adverse changes in interest rates. We manage both these risks through normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative instruments as well as foreign currency debt. We cannot be certain, however, that we will be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.Further, we have exposure to foreign currency movements because certain foreign currency transactions need to be converted to a different currency for settlement. These conversions can have a direct impact on our cash flows.Our tax rate is dependent upon a number of factors, a change in any of which could impact our future tax rates and net income.Our future tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: future changes in the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the estimated realization of our net deferred tax assets; the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for non-U.S. withholding taxes; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes; changes in available tax credits; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; and changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws. Losses for which no tax benefits can be recorded could materially impact our tax rate and its volatility from one quarter to another.13We face operational risks inherent in mining operations and our mining operations have the potential to cause safety issues, including those that could result in significant personal injury.We own two mines, a cesium mine in Manitoba, Canada, a portion of which is located under Bernic Lake, and an above-ground lignite mine, which is located close to our Marshall, Texas facility and operated by a subsidiary of The North American Coal Company. Mining operations by their nature involve a high level of uncertainty and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control. At our lignite mine, the risks are primarily operational risks associated with the maintenance and operation of the heavy equipment required to dig and haul the lignite, and risks relating to lower than expected lignite quality or recovery rates. Our underground mine in Manitoba is subject to a number of risks, including industrial accidents, unexpected geological conditions, fall of ground accidents or structural collapses, which, in the case of our cesium mine, could lead to flooding. Following a fall of ground incident in 2013, we implemented additional safety measures and several types of monitoring devices in the mine that have indicated good structural stability in the mine since that time. However, the structural stability may change at any time and there remains a possibility of deterioration and flooding of this mine. The failure to adequately manage these risks could result in significant personal injury, loss of life, damage to mineral properties, production facilities or mining equipment, damage to the environment, delays in or reduced production, and potential legal liabilities.Our operations and products are subject to extensive safety, health and environmental requirements, which could increase our costs and/or impair our ability to manufacture and sell certain products.Our ongoing operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety, health and environmental matters, many of which provide for substantial monetary fines and criminal sanctions for violations. These include requirements to obtain and comply with various environmental-related permits for constructing any new facilities and operating all of our existing facilities. In addition, in certain geographic areas, our carbon black and activated carbon facilities are or may become subject to greenhouse gas emission trading schemes under which we may be required to purchase emission credits if our emission levels exceed our allocations. Greenhouse gas regulatory programs that have been adopted, such as cap-and-trade programs, have not had a significant impact on our businesses to date. Costs of complying with regulations could increase as concerns related to greenhouse gases and climate change continue to emerge. The enactment of new environmental laws and regulations and/or the more aggressive interpretation of existing requirements could require us to incur significant costs for compliance or capital improvements or limit our current or planned operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow. We attempt to offset the effects of these compliance costs through price increases, productivity improvements and cost reduction efforts. Success in offsetting any such increased regulatory costs is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased regulatory costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales. (See “Legal Proceedings” in Item 3 below). In order to secure and maintain the right to produce or sell our products, we must satisfy product related regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions. Obtaining and maintaining these approvals requires a significant amount of product testing and data, and there is no certainty these approvals will be obtained. Certain national and international health organizations have classified carbon black as a possible or suspected human carcinogen. To the extent that, in the future, (i) these organizations re-classify carbon black as a known or confirmed carcinogen, (ii) other organizations or government authorities in other jurisdictions classify carbon black or any of our other finished products, raw materials or intermediates as suspected or known carcinogens or otherwise hazardous, or (iii) there is discovery of adverse health effects attributable to production or use of carbon black or any of our other finished products, raw materials or intermediates, we could be required to incur significantly higher costs to comply with environmental, health and safety laws, or to comply with restrictions on sales of our products, be subject to legal claims, and our reputation and business could be adversely affected. In addition, chemicals that are currently classified as non-hazardous may be classified as hazardous in the future, and our products may have characteristics that are not recognized today but may be found in the future to impair human health or to be carcinogenic.Action by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) related to its Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (“MATS”) that decreases demand for our mercury removal products, and/or the failure of tariffs placed on U.S. imports of Chinese activated carbon to adequately address the impact of low-priced imports from China, could have a material adverse effect on our Purification Solutions segment.Growth in the environmental portion of our Purification Solutions business depends on stable demand in the mercury removal related portion of the business, which is largely dependent on the amount of coal-based power generation used in the U.S. and the continued regulation of utilities under MATS. In August 2018, the EPA announced that it intends to reconsider the MATS rule and in September submitted its proposal to the White House Office of Management and Budget. Any action that the EPA takes related to MATS that decreases demand for our products for mercury removal will have a negative effect on the financial results of the Purification Solutions segment.14In addition, Purification Solutions faces competition in the U.S. from low-priced imports of activated carbon products. If the amounts of these low-priced imports increase, especially if they are sold at less than fair value, our sales of competing products could decline, which could have an adverse effect on the earnings of Purification Solutions. In addition, sales of these low-priced imports may negatively impact our pricing. To limit these activities, regulators in the U.S. have enacted an antidumping duty order on steam activated carbon products from China. In fiscal 2018, the order was extended for an additional five years. The amount of antidumping duties collected on imports of steam activated carbon from China is reviewed annually by the U.S. Department of Commerce. To the extent the antidumping margins do not adequately address the degree to which imports are unfairly traded, the antidumping order may be less effective in reducing the volume of these low-priced activated carbon imports in the U.S., which could negatively affect demand and/or pricing for our products. We have entered into a number of derivative contracts with financial counterparties. The effectiveness of these contracts is dependent on the ability of these financial counterparties to perform their obligations and their nonperformance could harm our financial condition.We have entered into forward foreign currency contracts and cross-currency swaps as part of our financial risk management strategy. The effectiveness of our risk management program using these instruments is dependent, in part, upon the counterparties to these contracts honoring their financial obligations. If any of our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations in the future, we could be exposed to increased earnings and cash flow volatility due to an instrument’s failure to hedge or adequately address a financial risk.The continued protection of our patents, trade secrets and other proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success.Our patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and competitive position. We own various patents and other intellectual property rights in the U.S. and other countries covering many of our products, as well as processes and product uses. Where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable, we rely on trade secret laws and practices to protect our proprietary technology and processes, such as physical security, limited dissemination and access and confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, consultants, business partners, potential licensees and others to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect and the protective measures we have put in place may not prevent disclosure or unauthorized use of our proprietary information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of misappropriation or other violations of our proprietary rights. In addition, we are a licensee of various patents and intellectual property rights belonging to others in the U.S. and other countries. Because the laws and enforcement mechanisms of some countries may not allow us to protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as we are able to do in the U.S., the strength of our intellectual property rights will vary from country to country.Irrespective of our proprietary intellectual property rights, we may be subject to claims that our products, processes or product uses infringe the intellectual property rights of others. These claims, even if they are without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend and if we were to lose such claims, we could be enjoined from selling our products or using our processes and/or be subject to damages, or be required to enter into licensing agreements requiring royalty payments and/or use restrictions. Licensing agreements may not be available to us, or if available, may not be available on acceptable terms.Natural disasters could affect our operations and financial results.We operate facilities in areas of the world that are exposed to natural hazards, such as floods, windstorms, hurricanes, and earthquakes. Extreme weather events present physical risks that may become more frequent as a result of factors related to climate change. Such events could disrupt our supply of raw materials or otherwise affect production, transportation and delivery of our products or affect demand for our products"

 In addition to factors described elsewhere in this report, the following are important factors that could adversely affect our business. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations and financial results. Negative or uncertain worldwide or regional economic conditions may adversely impact our business. Our operations and performance are affected by worldwide and regional economic conditions. Continued uncertainty or a deterioration in the economic conditions affecting the businesses to which, or geographic areas in which, we sell products could reduce demand for our products. We may also experience pricing pressure on products and services, which could decrease our revenues and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. In addition, during periods of economic uncertainty, our customers may temporarily pursue inventory reduction measures that exceed declines in the actual underlying demand. Our businesses are sensitive to industry capacity utilization, particularly Reinforcement Materials and Purification Solutions. As a result, pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur, which could affect our financial performance.As a chemical manufacturing company, our operations are subject to operational risks and have the potential to cause environmental or other damage as well as personal injury, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. The operation of a chemical manufacturing business as well as the sale and distribution of chemical products are subject to operational as well as safety, health and environmental risks. For example, the production and/or processing of carbon black, specialty compounds, fumed metal oxides, aerogel, activated carbon and other chemicals involve the handling, transportation, manufacture or use of certain substances or components that may be considered toxic or hazardous. Our manufacturing processes and the transportation of chemical products are subject to risks inherent in chemical manufacturing, including leaks, fires, explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures or unscheduled downtime. If operational risks materialize, they could result in injury or loss of life, damage to the environment, or damage to property. In addition, the occurrence of material operating problems at our 10facilities or a disruption in our supply chain or distribution operations may result in loss of production, which, in turn, may make it difficult for us to meet customer needs. Accordingly, these events and their consequences could negatively impact the Company’s results of operations and cash flows, both during and after the period of operational difficulties, and could harm our reputation. A significant adverse change in a customer relationship or the failure of a customer to perform its obligations under agreements with us could harm our business or cash flows. Our success in strengthening relationships and growing business with our largest customers and retaining their business over extended time periods could affect our future results. We have a group of key customers across our businesses that together represent a significant portion of our total net sales and operating revenues. The loss of any of our important customers, or a significant reduction in volumes sold to them, could adversely affect our results of operations until such business is replaced or any temporary disruption ends. Any deterioration in the financial condition of any of our customers that impairs our customers’ ability to make payments to us also could increase our uncollectible receivables and could affect our future results and financial condition. Volatility in the price of energy and raw materials could impact our margins and working capital. Our manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of energy and raw materials, the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond our control. Dramatic increases in such costs or decreases in the availability of raw materials at acceptable costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, movements in the market price for crude oil typically affect carbon black feedstock costs. Significant movements in the market price for crude oil tend to create volatility in our carbon black feedstock costs, which can affect our working capital and results of operations. Certain of our carbon black supply contracts contain provisions that adjust prices to account for changes in a relevant feedstock price index. We also attempt to offset the effects of increases in raw material and energy costs through selling price increases in our non-contract sales, productivity improvements and cost reduction efforts. Success in offsetting increased raw material and energy costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased raw material and energy costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales. If we are not able to fully offset the effects of increased raw material or energy costs, it could have a significant impact on our financial results. Rapid declines in energy and raw material costs can also negatively impact our financial results, as such changes can negatively affect the returns we receive on our energy centers and yield improvement investments, and may negatively impact our contract pricing adjustments. In addition, we use a variety of feedstock indices in our supply contracts to adjust our prices for changes in raw materials costs. Depending on feedstock markets and our choice of feedstocks, the indices we use in our supply contracts may not precisely track our actual costs. This could result in an incongruity between our contract pricing adjustments and changes in our actual feedstock costs, which can affect our margins.We may not be successful achieving our growth expectations from new products, new applications and technology developments, and money we spend on these efforts may not result in a proportional increase in our revenues or profits. We may not be successful achieving our growth expectations from developing new products or product applications. Moreover, we cannot be certain that the costs we incur investing in new product and technology development will result in a proportional increase in our revenues or profits. In addition, the timely commercialization of products that we are developing may be disrupted or delayed by manufacturing or other technical difficulties, market acceptance or insufficient market size to support a new product, competitors’ new products, and difficulties in moving from the experimental stage to the production stage. These disruptions or delays could affect our future business results.We face operational risks inherent in mining operations and our mining operations have the potential to cause safety issues, including those that could result in significant personal injury. We own two mines, a cesium mine in Manitoba, Canada, a portion of which is located under Bernic Lake, and an above-ground lignite mine, which is located close to our Marshall, Texas facility and operated by a subsidiary of The North American Coal Company. Mining operations by their nature are activities that involve a high level of uncertainty and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control. At our lignite mine, the risks are primarily operational risks associated with the maintenance and operation of the heavy equipment required to dig and haul the lignite, and risks relating to lower than expected lignite quality or recovery rates. Our underground mine in Manitoba is subject to a number of risks, including industrial accidents, unexpected geological conditions, fall of ground accidents or structural collapses, which, in the case of our cesium mine, could lead to flooding, and lower than expected ore quality, ore grades or recovery rates. Following a fall of ground incident in 2013, we implemented additional safety measures and several types of monitoring devices in the mine that have indicated good structural stability in the mine since that time. However, the structural stability may change at any time and there is a possibility of deterioration and flooding of this mine. While we have not mined at our mine in Manitoba since we completed a development project at that site in November 2015, we may resume those mining operations in the future. The failure to adequately manage these risks could result in significant personal 11injury, loss of life, damage to mineral properties, production facilities or mining equipment, damage to the environment, delays in or reduced production, and potential legal liabilities. Any failure to realize benefits from acquisitions, alliances or joint ventures could adversely affect future financial results. In achieving our strategic plan objectives, we may pursue strategic bolt-on acquisitions or joint ventures intended to complement or expand our existing businesses globally or add product technology, or both. The success of acquisitions of businesses, new technologies and products, or arrangements with third parties is not always predictable and we may not be successful in realizing our objectives as anticipated. We may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business results. Plant capacity expansions and site development projects may be delayed and/or not achieve the expected benefits. Our ability to complete capacity expansions and other site development projects as planned may be delayed or interrupted by the need to obtain environmental and other regulatory approvals, unexpected cost increases, availability of labor and materials, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. Moreover, the cost of these activities could have a negative impact on the financial performance of the relevant business, and in the case of capacity expansion projects, until capacity utilization at the particular facility is sufficient to absorb the incremental costs associated with the expansion. In addition, our ability to expand capacity in emerging regions depends in part on economic and political conditions in these regions and, in some cases, on our ability to establish operations, construct additional manufacturing capacity or form strategic business alliances. An interruption in our operations as a result of fence-line arrangements could disrupt our manufacturing operations and adversely affect our financial results. At certain of our facilities we have fence-line arrangements with adjacent third party manufacturing operations (“fence-line partners”), who provide raw materials for our manufacturing operations and/or take by-products generated from our operations. Accordingly, any unplanned disruptions or curtailments in a fence-line partner’s production facilities that impacts their ability to supply us with raw materials or to take our manufacturing by-products could disrupt our manufacturing operations or cause us to incur increased operating costs to mitigate such disruption.If our assumptions about future sales and profitability of the Purification Solutions segment are incorrect and we do not achieve our growth expectations for this business, we may be required to impair certain assets.We performed our annual goodwill impairment test of Purification Solutions as of May 31, 2016 and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 9% at that time.  Our strategic plan underlying this analysis relies on further growth in the mercury removal related portion of the business, which is largely dependent on the amount of coal-based power generation used in the United States and the continued regulation of those utilities under the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (“MATS”). The analysis also anticipates growth in demand for our activated carbon products in other applications, while maintaining our margin expectations.  If competitive forces, unfavorable macroeconomic trends or environmental policy changes render our assumptions concerning demand growth and margin expectations for the business unreasonable, or we are not otherwise able to successfully execute plans to achieve our growth expectations for this business, there may be an impairment of certain assets.  We are exposed to political or country risk inherent in doing business in some countries. Sales outside of the U.S. constituted a majority of our revenues in fiscal 2016. Although much of our international business is currently in regions where the political and economic risk levels and established legal systems are similar to those in the U.S., we also conduct business in countries that have less stable legal systems and financial markets, and potentially more corrupt business environments than the U.S. Our operations in some countries may be subject to the following risks: changes in the rate of economic growth; unsettled political or economic conditions; non-renewal of operating permits or licenses; possible expropriation or other governmental actions; corruption by government officials and other third parties; social unrest, war, terrorist activities or other armed conflict; confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; deprivation of contract rights; trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital; exchange controls; inflation; currency fluctuations and devaluation; the effect of global health, safety and environmental matters on economic conditions and market opportunities; and changes in financial policy and availability of credit. In addition, there may be costs associated with repatriating income or capital. 12We face competition from other specialty chemical companies. We operate in a highly competitive marketplace. Our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize new and innovative, high value-added products for existing and future customers. Increased competition from existing or newly developed products offered by our competitors or companies whose products offer a similar functionality as our products and could be substituted for our products, may negatively affect demand for our products. In addition, actions by our competitors could affect our ability to maintain or raise prices, successfully enter new markets or maintain or grow our market position. Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results. As more fully described in “Item 3—Legal Proceedings”, we are a party to or the subject of lawsuits, claims, and proceedings, including, but not limited to, those involving environmental, and health and safety matters as well as product liability and personal injury claims relating to asbestosis, silicosis, and coal worker’s pneumoconiosis. We are also a potentially responsible party in various environmental proceedings and remediation matters wherein substantial amounts are at issue. Adverse rulings, judgments or settlements in pending or future litigation (including liabilities associated with respirator claims) or in connection with environmental remediation activities could adversely affect our financial results or cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in any forward-looking statements. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates could affect our financial results. We earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In fiscal 2016, we derived a majority of our revenues from sales outside the U.S. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in countries where we operate will affect our results of operations and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time. In addition, we are exposed to adverse changes in interest rates. We manage both these risks through normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative instruments as well as foreign currency debt. We cannot be certain, however, that we will be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.Further, we have exposure to foreign currency movements because certain foreign currency transactions need to be converted to a different currency for settlement. These conversions can have a direct impact on our cash flows.Our tax rate is dependent upon a number of factors, a change in any of which could impact our future tax rates and net income. Our future tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: future changes in the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the estimated realization of our net deferred tax assets; the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. income and non-U.S. withholding taxes; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes, including charges from impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions; changes in available tax credits; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; and changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws. Losses for which no tax benefits can be recorded could materially impact our tax rate and its volatility from one quarter to another.Information technology systems failures, data security breaches or network disruptions could compromise our information, disrupt our operations and expose us to liability, which may adversely impact our operations.In the ordinary course of our business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and certain information of our customers, suppliers, business partners, and employees in our information technology systems.  The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this data is critical to our operations.   Information technology systems failures, including risks associated with upgrading our systems or in successfully integrating information technology and other systems in connection with the integration of businesses we acquire, network disruptions or unauthorized access could disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions and our financial reporting, and our ability to protect our customer or company information, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, as with all enterprise information systems, our information technology systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information, corrupting information, or disrupting business processes.  Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential information about the Company, our employees, our vendors, or our customers, could result in legal claims or proceedings and potential liability for us, damage to our reputation, and could otherwise harm our business and our results of operations.  13Our operations are subject to extensive safety, health and environmental requirements, which could increase our costs and/or reduce our profit. Our ongoing operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety, health and environmental matters, many of which provide for substantial monetary fines and criminal sanctions for violations. These include requirements to obtain and comply with various environmental-related permits for constructing any new facilities and operating all of our existing facilities. In addition, in certain geographic areas, our carbon black and activated carbon facilities are subject to greenhouse gas emission trading schemes under which we may be required to purchase emission credits if our emission levels exceed our allocations. The enactment of new environmental laws and regulations and/or the more aggressive interpretation of existing requirements could require us to incur significant costs for compliance or capital improvements or limit our current or planned operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow. We attempt to offset the effects of these compliance costs through price increases, productivity improvements and cost reduction efforts. Success in offsetting any such increased regulatory costs is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased regulatory costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales. See “Item 3 Legal Proceedings—Environmental Proceedings”. The elimination of tariffs placed on U.S. imports of Chinese activated carbon, or their failure to adequately address the impact of low-priced imports from China, could have a material adverse effect on our Purification Solutions segment. Purification Solutions faces pressure and competition in the U.S. from low-priced imports of activated carbon products. If the amounts of these low-priced imports increase, especially if they are sold at less than fair value, our sales of competing products could decline, which could have an adverse effect on the earnings of Purification Solutions. In addition, sales of these low-priced imports may negatively impact our pricing. To limit these activities, regulators in the U.S. have enacted an antidumping duty order on steam activated carbon products from China.  A proceeding that will evaluate whether to extend the order for an additional five years will be initiated in February 2018.  The amount of antidumping duties collected on imports of steam activated carbon from China is reviewed annually by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  To the extent the antidumping margins do not adequately address the degree to which imports are unfairly traded, the antidumping order may be less effective in reducing the volume of these low-priced activated carbon imports in the U.S., which could negatively affect demand and/or pricing for our products. In addition, if the antidumping order is not extended beyond its current term, the amount of low-priced imports from China may increase, which could have an adverse effect on our Purification Solutions business.We have entered into a number of derivative contracts with financial counterparties.  The effectiveness of these contracts is dependent on the ability of these financial counterparties to perform their obligations and their nonperformance could harm our financial condition.We have entered into forward foreign currency contracts and cross currency swaps as part of our financial risk management strategy.  The effectiveness of our risk management program using these instruments is dependent, in part, upon the counterparties to these contracts honoring their financial obligations.  If any of our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations in the future, we could be exposed to increased earnings and cash flow volatility due to an instrument’s failure to hedge or adequately address a financial risk. The continued protection of our patents, trade secrets and other proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success. Our patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and competitive position. We own various patents and other intellectual property rights in the U.S. and other countries covering many of our products, as well as processes and product uses. Where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable, we rely on trade secret laws and practices to protect our proprietary technology and processes, such as physical security, limited dissemination and access and confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, consultants, business partners, potential licensees and others to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect and the protective measures we have put in place may not prevent disclosure or unauthorized use of our proprietary information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of misappropriation or other violations of our proprietary rights. In addition, we are a licensee of various patents and intellectual property rights belonging to others in the U.S. and other countries. Because the laws and enforcement mechanisms of some countries may not allow us to protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as we are able to do in the U.S., the strength of our intellectual property rights will vary from country to country. Irrespective of our proprietary intellectual property rights, we may be subject to claims that our products, processes or product uses infringe the intellectual property rights of others. These claims, even if they are without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend and if we were to lose such claims, we could be enjoined from selling our products or using our processes and/or be subject to damages, or be required to enter into licensing agreements requiring royalty payments and/or use restrictions. Licensing agreements may not be available to us, or if available, may not be available on acceptable terms. 14Natural disasters could affect our operations and financial results. We operate facilities in areas of the world that are exposed to natural hazards, such as floods, windstorms, hurricanes, and earthquakes. Such events could disrupt our supply of raw materials or otherwise affect production, transportation and delivery of our products or affect demand for our products"
3,CBT,CABOT CORP,2015-11-25,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
 In addition to factors described elsewhere in this report, the following are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations and financial results. Negative or uncertain worldwide or regional economic conditions may adversely impact our business. Our operations and performance are affected by worldwide and regional economic conditions. Continued uncertainty or a deterioration in the economic conditions affecting the businesses to which, or geographic areas in which, we sell products could reduce demand for our products. We may also experience pricing pressure on products and services, which could decrease our revenues and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. In addition, during periods of economic uncertainty, our customers may temporarily pursue inventory reduction measures that exceed declines in the actual underlying demand. Our businesses are sensitive to industry capacity utilization, particularly Reinforcement Materials and Purification Solutions. As a result, pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur, which could affect our financial performance. As a chemical manufacturing company, our operations are subject to operational risks and have the potential to cause environmental or other damage as well as personal injury, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. The operation of a chemical manufacturing business as well as the sale and distribution of chemical products involve safety, health and environmental risks. For example, the production and/or processing of carbon black, fumed metal oxides, aerogel, activated carbon and other chemicals involve the handling, transportation, manufacture or use of certain substances or components that may be considered toxic or hazardous. Our manufacturing processes and the transportation of chemical products entail risks such as leaks, fires, explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures or unscheduled downtime. If operational risks materialize, they could result in injury or loss of life, damage to the environment, or damage to property. In addition, the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities may result in loss of production, which, in turn, may make it difficult for us to meet customer 10needs. Accordingly, these events and their consequences could negatively impact the Company’s results of operations and cash flows, both during and after the period of operational difficulties, and could harm our reputation. A significant adverse change in a customer relationship or the failure of a customer to perform its obligations under agreements with us could harm our business or cash flows. Our success in strengthening relationships and growing business with our largest customers and retaining their business over extended time periods could affect our future results. We have a group of key customers across our businesses that together represent a significant portion of our total net sales and operating revenues. The loss of any of our important customers, or a significant reduction in volumes sold to them, could adversely affect our results of operations until such business is replaced or any temporary disruption ends. Any deterioration in the financial condition of any of our customers that impairs our customers’ ability to make payments to us also could increase our uncollectible receivables and could affect our future results and financial condition. Our restructuring activities and cost saving initiatives may not achieve the results we anticipate. We have undertaken and expect to continue to undertake cost reduction initiatives and organizational restructurings to improve operating efficiencies, optimize our asset base and generate cost savings. For example, we have recently undertaken a restructuring plan to reduce our cost structure. We cannot be certain that we will be able to complete these initiatives as planned or without business interruption, or that the estimated operating efficiencies or cost savings from such activities will be fully realized or maintained over time. Volatility in the price of energy and raw materials could impact our margins and working capital. Our manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of energy and raw materials, the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond our control. Dramatic increases in such costs or decreases in the availability of raw materials at acceptable costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, movements in the market price for crude oil typically affect carbon black feedstock costs. Significant movements in the market price for crude oil tend to create volatility in our carbon black feedstock costs, which can affect our working capital and results of operations. Certain of our carbon black supply contracts contain provisions that adjust prices to account for changes in a relevant feedstock price index. We attempt to offset the effects of increases in raw material costs through selling price increases in our non-contract sales, productivity improvements and cost reduction efforts. Success in offsetting increased raw material costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased raw material and energy costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales. If we are not able to fully offset the effects of increased raw material or energy costs, it could have a significant impact on our financial results.  Rapid declines in energy and raw material costs can also negatively impact our financial results, as such changes can negatively affect the returns we receive on our energy centers and yield improvement investments, and may negatively impact our contract pricing adjustments.  In addition, we use a variety of feedstock indices in our supply contracts to adjust our prices for changes in raw materials costs.  Depending on feedstock markets and our choice of feedstocks, the indices we use in our supply contracts may not precisely track  our actual costs.  This could result in an incongruity between our contract pricing adjustments and changes in our actual feedstock costs, which can affect our margins.The strategic growth plan of the mercury removal products portion of our Purification Solutions segment relies significantly on the enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, and if our assumptions about future sales and profitability prove incorrect, we may be required to impair certain assets. The strategic growth plan for the mercury removal products portion of our Purification Solutions segment relies significantly upon the enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, particularly those that would require industrial facilities to reduce the quantity of air pollutants they release. In particular, we expect demand for our activated carbon products to increase as coal fired utilities in the U.S. enhance their emission control systems in order to comply with the U.S. Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS), which sets forth federal mercury emission levels. The implementation period for the MATS regulation began in April 2015, although state permitting agencies that enforce these standards were authorized to allow a one-year extension of time for compliance.  In addition, the MATS regulation has been subject to legal challenge, and in June, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the EPA unreasonably failed to consider costs in determining whether it is necessary and appropriate to regulate hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, emitted by coal-fired utilities and remanded the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for further proceedings.  Pending these legal proceedings, the MATS regulation remains in effect and utilities are required to comply with these emission regulations unless they obtained an extension.  However, there are a number of possible outcomes of the U.S. Court of Appeals’ current review, ranging from the current rule staying in place to a significant multi-year delay in the time when compliance is required, if at all. In our assumptions about the future sales and profitability of the mercury removal products portion of our Purification Solutions segment, we have assumed an approximate two year delay in the time within which compliance with MATS will be required.  If our assumptions concerning sales volumes or margins are incorrect because of a change 11in the implementation of or requirements under MATS as a result of the Court’s review or otherwise, our actual results for our activated carbon business could be less than expected, which could lead to an impairment of certain assets.Our mining operations have the potential to cause safety issues, including those that could result in significant personal injury. We own two mines, a cesium mine in Manitoba, Canada, a portion of which is located under Bernic Lake, and an above-ground lignite mine, which is located close to our Marshall, Texas facility and operated by a subsidiary of The North American Coal Company. Mining operations by their nature are activities that involve a high level of uncertainty and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control. At our lignite mine, the risks are primarily operational risks associated with the maintenance and operation of the heavy equipment required to dig and haul the lignite, and risks relating to lower than expected lignite quality or recovery rates.   Our underground mine in Manitoba is subject to a number of risks, including industrial accidents, unexpected geological conditions, fall of ground accidents or structural collapses, which, in the case of our cesium mine, could lead to flooding, and lower than expected ore quality, ore grades or recovery rates.  In 2013, following a fall of ground in a portion of the mine that contains significant cesium reserves, we implemented additional safety measures and added several types of monitoring devices in the mine.  Since that time, the monitoring devices have indicated good structural stability in the mine, however, the structural stability may change at any time and there is a possibility of further deterioration and flooding of this mine.  In November 2015, we successfully completed a development project at our mine in Manitoba, Canada and we are not currently mining at the site.  The failure to adequately manage these risks could result in significant personal injury, loss of life, damage to mineral properties, production facilities or mining equipment, damage to the environment, delays in or reduced production, and potential legal liabilities. Any failure to realize benefits from acquisitions, alliances or joint ventures could adversely affect future financial results. Attainment of our strategic plan objectives requires, in part, strategic acquisitions or joint ventures intended to complement or expand our businesses globally or add product technology, or both. The success of acquisitions of businesses, new technologies and products, or arrangements with third parties is not always predictable and we may not be successful in realizing our objectives as anticipated. We may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business results. Plant capacity expansions and site development projects may be delayed and/or not achieve the expected benefits. Our ability to complete capacity expansions and other site development projects as planned may be delayed or interrupted by the need to obtain environmental and other regulatory approvals, unexpected cost increases, availability of labor and materials, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. Moreover, the cost of these activities could have a negative impact on the financial performance of the relevant business, and in the case of capacity expansion projects, until capacity utilization at the particular facility is sufficient to absorb the incremental costs associated with the expansion. In addition, our ability to expand capacity in emerging regions depends in part on economic and political conditions in these regions and, in some cases, on our ability to establish operations, construct additional manufacturing capacity or form strategic business alliances. An interruption in our operations as a result of fence-line arrangements could disrupt our manufacturing operations and adversely affect our financial results. At certain of our facilities we have fence-line arrangements with adjacent third party manufacturing operations (“fence-line partners”), who provide raw materials for our manufacturing operations and/or take by-products generated from our operations. Accordingly, any unplanned disruptions or curtailments in a fence-line partner’s production facilities that impacts their ability to supply us with raw materials or to take our manufacturing by-products could disrupt our manufacturing operations or cause us to incur increased operating costs to mitigate such disruption. We are exposed to political or country risk inherent in doing business in some countries. Sales outside of the U.S. constituted a majority of our revenues in fiscal 2015. Although much of our international business is currently in regions where the political and economic risk levels and established legal systems are similar to those in the U.S., we also conduct business in countries that have less stable legal systems and financial markets, and potentially more corrupt business environments than the U.S. Our operations in some countries may be subject to the following risks: changes in the rate of economic growth; unsettled political or economic conditions; possible expropriation or other governmental actions; corruption by government officials and other third parties; social unrest, war, terrorist activities or other armed conflict; confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; deprivation of contract rights; trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital; exchange controls; inflation; currency fluctuations and devaluation; the effect of global health, safety and environmental matters on economic conditions and market opportunities; and changes in financial policy and availability of credit. We have an equity method investment in Venezuela, a 12country that has established rigid controls over the ability of foreign companies to repatriate cash and which has effectively devalued its currency in the past. Such exchange controls could potentially impact our ability, in both the short and long term, to recover both the cost of our investment and earnings from that investment. We face competition from other specialty chemical companies. We operate in a highly competitive marketplace. Our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize new and innovative, high value-added products for existing and future customers. Increased competition from existing or newly developed products offered by our competitors or companies whose products offer a similar functionality as our products and could be substituted for our products, may negatively affect demand for our products. In addition, actions by our competitors could affect our ability to maintain or raise prices, successfully enter new markets or maintain or grow our market position. Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results. As more fully described in “Item 3—Legal Proceedings”, we are a party to or the subject of lawsuits, claims, and proceedings, including, but not limited to, those involving environmental, and health and safety matters as well as product liability and personal injury claims relating to asbestosis, silicosis, and coal worker’s pneumoconiosis. We are also a potentially responsible party in various environmental proceedings and remediation matters wherein substantial amounts are at issue. Adverse rulings, judgments or settlements in pending or future litigation (including liabilities associated with respirator claims) or in connection with environmental remediation activities could adversely affect our financial results or cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in any forward-looking statements. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates could affect our financial results. We earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In fiscal 2015, we derived a majority of our revenues from sales outside the U.S. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in countries where we operate will affect our results of operations and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time. In addition, we are exposed to adverse changes in interest rates. We manage both these risks through normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative instruments as well as foreign currency debt. We cannot be certain, however, that we will be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.  There are also instances where we have direct current exposures to foreign currency movements because settlement back into a different currency is intended. These situations can have a direct impact on our cash flows. Our tax rate is dependent upon a number of factors, a change in any of which could impact our future tax rates and net income. Our future tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws; changes in the estimated realization of our net deferred tax assets; the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. income and non-U.S. withholding taxes; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes, including impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions; changes in available tax credits; and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities. Losses for which no tax benefits can be recorded could materially impact our tax rate and its volatility from one quarter to another. Any significant change in our jurisdictional earnings mix or in the tax laws in those jurisdictions could impact our future tax rates and net income in those periods. We may be subject to information technology systems failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security. We depend on integrated information systems to conduct our business. Information technology systems failures, including risks associated with upgrading our systems or in successfully integrating information technology and other systems in connection with the integration of businesses we acquire, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions, our ability to protect customer or company information and our financial reporting. Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, could be damaged or interrupted by power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, events such as fires, earthquakes, floods, tornadoes and hurricanes, and/or errors by our employees. Although we have taken steps to address these concerns by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control measures and back-up systems at multiple sites, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 13Our operations are subject to extensive safety, health and environmental requirements, which could increase our costs and/or reduce our profit. Our ongoing operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety, health and environmental matters, many of which provide for substantial monetary fines and criminal sanctions for violations. These include requirements to obtain and comply with various environmental-related permits for constructing any new facilities and operating all of our existing facilities, and, in certain geographic areas, to pay emissions-related fees based on certain emissions levels. The enactment of new environmental laws and regulations and/or the more aggressive interpretation of existing requirements could require us to incur significant costs for compliance or capital improvements or limit our current or planned operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow. We attempt to offset the effects of these compliance costs through price increases, productivity improvements and cost reduction efforts.  Success in offsetting any such increased regulatory costs is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the segment served.  Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased regulatory costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales.  See “Item 3 Legal Proceedings—Environmental Proceedings”. Regulations requiring a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions may impact our carbon black and activated carbon operations. Global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions impact the carbon black and activated carbon industries as carbon dioxide is emitted from those manufacturing processes. The European Commission’s Emissions Trading Scheme applies to our carbon black facilities and one of our activated carbon facilities in Europe, and we generally expect to purchase emission credits where necessary to respond to allocation shortfalls. However, if our carbon black or activated carbon operations generate more carbon dioxide than our allocations permit, the cost to purchase allocation credits at that time may be unacceptable to us. There are also regulatory developments in other regions and countries, including the U.S., Canada, China and Brazil, regarding greenhouse gas emission reduction programs. Those programs have not yet been fully defined and their potential impact on our manufacturing operations or financial results cannot be estimated at this time. The money we spend developing new businesses and technologies may not result in a proportional increase in our revenues or profits. We cannot be certain that the costs we incur investing in new businesses and technologies will result in a proportional increase in revenues or profits. In addition, the timely commercialization of products that we are developing may be disrupted or delayed by manufacturing or other technical difficulties, market acceptance or insufficient market size to support a new product, competitors’ new products, and difficulties in moving from the experimental stage to the production stage. These disruptions or delays could affect our future business results. The reduction or elimination of tariffs placed on U.S. imports of Chinese activated carbon could have a material adverse effect on our Purification Solutions segment. Purification Solutions faces pressure and competition in its U.S. markets from low-priced imports of activated carbon products that are frequently sold at less than fair value in the U.S. If the amounts of these low-priced imports increase, especially if they are sold at less than fair value, our sales of competing products could decline, which could have an adverse effect on the earnings of Purification Solutions. In addition, sales of these low-priced imports may negatively impact our pricing. To limit these activities, regulators in the U.S. have enacted antidumping duties on steam activated carbon products that are set to expire in 2017, subject to provisions for renewal. The amount of these antidumping duties are reviewed annually, and the lower the tariff, the less effective they may be in reducing the volume of low-priced activated carbon imports in the U.S., which could negatively effect demand or pricing for our products. The continued protection of our patents, trade secrets and other proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success. Our patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and competitive position. We own various patents and other intellectual property rights in the U.S. and other countries covering many of our products, as well as processes and product uses. Where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable, we rely on trade secret laws and practices to protect our proprietary technology and processes, such as physical security, limited dissemination and access and confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, consultants, business partners, potential licensees and others to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect and the protective measures we have put in place may not prevent disclosure or unauthorized use of our proprietary information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of misappropriation or other violations of our proprietary rights. In addition, we are a licensee of various patents and intellectual property rights belonging to others in the U.S. and other countries. Because the laws and enforcement mechanisms of some countries may not allow us to protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as we are able to do in the U.S., the strength of our intellectual property rights will vary from country to country. 14Irrespective of our proprietary intellectual property rights, we may be subject to claims that our products, processes or product uses infringe the intellectual property rights of others. These claims, even if they are without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend and if we were to lose such claims, we could be enjoined from selling our products or using our processes and/or be subject to damages, or be required to enter into licensing agreements requiring royalty payments and/or use restrictions. Licensing agreements may not be available to us, or if available, may not be available on acceptable terms. Natural disasters could affect our operations and financial results. We operate facilities in areas of the world that are exposed to natural hazards, such as floods, windstorms and earthquakes. Such events could disrupt our supply of raw materials or otherwise affect production, transportation and delivery of our products or affect demand for our products"

  In addition to factors described elsewhere in this report, the following are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. Therisks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations and financial results.   13 Table of ContentsNegative or uncertain worldwide or regional economic conditions may adversely impact our business. Our operations and performance are affected by worldwide and regional economic conditions. Continued uncertainty or a deterioration in the economicconditions affecting the businesses to which, or geographic areas in which, we sell products could reduce demand for our products. We may also experience pricing pressure on products and services, which could decrease our revenues and have anadverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. In addition, during periods of economic uncertainty, our customers may temporarily pursue inventory reduction measures that exceed declines in the actual underlying demand. Our businesses aresensitive to industry capacity utilization, particularly Reinforcement Materials. As a result, pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur, which could affect our financial performance. As a chemical manufacturing company, our operations are subject to operational risks and have the potential to cause environmental or other damage as well aspersonal injury, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.  The operation of a chemicalmanufacturing business as well as the sale and distribution of chemical products involve safety, health and environmental risks. For example, the production and/or processing of carbon black, fumed metal oxides, aerogel, activated carbon and otherchemicals involve the handling, transportation, manufacture or use of certain substances or components that may be considered toxic or hazardous. Our manufacturing processes and the transportation of chemical products entail risks such as leaks,fires, explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures or unscheduled downtime. If operational risks materialize, they could result in injury or loss of life, damage to the environment, or damage to property. In addition, the occurrence of materialoperating problems at our facilities may result in loss of production, which, in turn, may make it difficult for us to meet customer needs. Accordingly, these events and their consequences could negatively impact the Companys results ofoperations and cash flows, both during and after the period of operational difficulties, and could harm our reputation.  The strategic growth plan ofthe mercury removal products portion of our Purification Solutions business relies significantly on the enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, and if our assumptions about future sales and profitability prove incorrect, we may berequired to impair or write off certain assets.  The strategic growth plan for the mercury removal products portion of ourPurification Solutions business relies significantly upon the enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, particularly those that would require industrial facilities to reduce the quantity of air pollutants they release. In particular, weexpect demand for our activated carbon products to increase as coal fired utilities in the U.S. enhance their emission control systems in order to comply with the U.S. Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS), which sets forth federal mercuryemission levels. Utilities are required to comply with these standards beginning in April 2015, although state permitting agencies that enforce these standards are authorized to allow a one-year extension of time for compliance. Recently, the U.S.Supreme Court agreed to consider whether the EPA appropriately considered costs in determining whether it is necessary and appropriate to regulate hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utilities. This appeal follows the U.S. Court of Appealsfor the District of Columbia Circuit decision in April 2014, which considered this issue and upheld the MATS regulation. It is not possible to predict the outcome of the Supreme Courts review of this matter. Our growth assumptions for thisbusiness also include assumptions about the amount of activated carbon that is needed to effectively reduce mercury emissions to the levels required by MATS. If our assumptions concerning sales volumes or margins are incorrect, or there is a changein the implementation of or requirements under MATS, as a result of the Supreme Courts review or otherwise, our actual results for our activated carbon business could be less than expected. If that were the case, we may not be able to realizethe value of the assets of this business, which could lead to an impairment or write-off of certain assets. Our Purification Solutions business had $458 million of goodwill and $289 million of intangible assets at September 30, 2014.  14 Table of ContentsOur mining operations have the potential to cause safety issues, including those that could result in significantpersonal injury, and a disruption in our cesium mining operations could disrupt our supply of raw materials for our Specialty Fluids business.  We have underground cesium mining operations in Manitoba, Canada, and own an above-ground lignite mine close to our Marshall, Texas facility which is operated by a subsidiary of The North American Coal Company.Mining operations by their nature are activities that involve a high level of uncertainty and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control. These operational risks include, but are not limited to, industrial accidents; unexpectedgeological conditions; fall of ground accidents or structural collapses at underground mines; and lower than expected quality, ore grades or recovery rates. The failure to adequately manage these risks could result in significant personal injury,loss of life, damage to mineral properties, production facilities or mining equipment, damage to the environment, delays in or reduced production, and potential legal liabilities. The principal raw material used by our Specialty Fluids business is pollucite (cesium ore), the vast majority of which we obtain from our mine inManitoba, a portion of which is located under Bernic Lake. In 2013, following a fall of ground in a portion of the mine that contains significant cesium reserves, we implemented additional safety measures and several types of monitoring devices inthe mine, based on the advice of our third-party mining consultants. Since their implementation in July 2013, the monitoring devices have indicated good structural stability in the mine, and we have resumed normal mining activities with respect tothe areas not affected by the fall of ground. The structural stability may be subject to change at any time, including the potential for further deterioration and flooding, even in the near term. After the fall of ground in 2013, we began to assessthe technical and economic feasibility of development alternatives at the mine to enable us to continue to access our pollucite reserves, and recently began a development project in a portion of the mine unaffected by the instability. If thisproject is successfully implemented, taking into account inventory on hand and our expected consumption rate, we expect our supply of cesium products to last approximately five years. We expect this development project will take approximately oneyear to complete, and there remains a risk of further deterioration of the mine over that period of time that could limit our ability to complete this project. Further, this project could experience unexpected cost increases or other problems ordelays. If we are unable to continue mining or unwilling to incur the costs associated with further developing the mine, we may be unable to obtain additional raw material for our Specialty Fluids business at an acceptable cost or at all. A significant adverse change in a customer relationship or the failure of a customer to perform its obligations under agreements with us could harmour business or cash flows.  Our success in strengthening relationships and growing business with our largest customers and retainingtheir business over extended time periods could affect our future results. We have a group of key customers across our businesses that together represent a significant portion of our total net sales and operating revenues. The loss of any of ourimportant customers, or a reduction in volumes sold to them, including because of a work stoppage or other disruption, could adversely affect our results of operations until such business is replaced or the disruption ends. Any deterioration in thefinancial condition of any of our customers or the industries they serve that impairs our customers ability to make payments to us also could increase our uncollectible receivables and could affect our future results and financial condition.In addition, we have significant receivables from a limited number of customers, which could create a concentration of credit risk.  Any failure torealize benefits from acquisitions, alliances or joint ventures could adversely affect future financial results.  Attainment of ourstrategic plan objectives requires, in part, strategic acquisitions or joint ventures intended to complement or expand our businesses globally or add product technology that accelerates our specialization strategy, or both. The success ofacquisitions of businesses, new technologies and products,   15 Table of Contentsor arrangements with third parties is not always predictable and we may not be successful in realizing our objectives as anticipated. We may not be able to integrate any acquired businessessuccessfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business results. Plant capacity expansions and site development projects may be delayed and/or not achieve the expected benefits. Our ability to complete capacity expansions and other site development projects as planned may be delayed or interrupted by the need to obtainenvironmental and other regulatory approvals, unexpected cost increases, availability of labor and materials, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. Moreover, the cost ofthese activities could have a negative impact on the financial performance of the relevant business, and in the case of capacity expansion projects, until capacity utilization at the particular facility is sufficient to absorb the incremental costsassociated with the expansion. In addition, our ability to expand capacity in emerging regions depends in part on economic and political conditions in these regions and, in some cases, on our ability to establish operations, construct additionalmanufacturing capacity or form strategic business alliances.  An interruption in our operations as a result of fence-line arrangements could disruptour manufacturing operations and adversely affect our financial results.  At certain of our facilities we have fence-linearrangements with adjacent third party manufacturing operations (fence-line partners), who provide raw materials for our manufacturing operations and/or take by-products generated from our operations. Accordingly, any unplanneddisruptions or curtailments in a fence-line partners production facilities that impacts their ability to supply us with raw materials or to take our manufacturing by-products could disrupt our manufacturing operations or cause us to incurincreased operating costs to mitigate such disruption.  Volatility in the price of energy and raw materials could decrease our margins. Our manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of energy and raw materials, the costs of which are subject to worldwidesupply and demand as well as other factors beyond our control. Dramatic increases in such costs or decreases in the availability of raw materials at acceptable costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, movementsin the market price for crude oil typically affect carbon black feedstock costs. Significant movements in the market price for crude oil tend to create volatility in our carbon black feedstock costs, which can affect our working capital and resultsof operations. Certain of our carbon black supply contracts contain provisions that adjust prices to account for changes in a relevant feedstock price index. We attempt to offset the effects of increases in raw material costs through selling priceincreases in our non-contract sales, productivity improvements and cost reduction efforts. Success in offsetting increased raw material costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could varysignificantly depending on the segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased raw material and energy costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales. Ifwe are not able to fully offset the effects of increased raw material or energy costs, it could have a significant impact on our financial results. We are exposed to political or country risk inherent in doing business in some countries. Sales outside of the U.S. constituted a majority of our revenues in fiscal 2014. Although much of our international business is currently in regionswhere the political and economic risk levels and established legal systems are similar to those in the U.S., we also conduct business in countries that have less stable legal systems and financial markets, and potentially more corrupt businessenvironments than the U.S. Our operations in some countries may be subject to the following risks: changes in the rate of economic   16 Table of Contentsgrowth; unsettled political or economic conditions; possible expropriation or other governmental actions; corruption by government officials and other third parties; social unrest, war, terroristactivities or other armed conflict; confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; deprivation of contract rights; trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products; reduced protection of intellectual property rights;restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital; exchange controls; inflation; currency fluctuations and devaluation; the effect of global health, safety and environmental matters on economic conditions and market opportunities; and changes infinancial policy and availability of credit. We have an equity method investment in Venezuela, a country that has established rigid controls over the ability of foreign companies to repatriate cash and which, during the last year, effectivelydevalued its currency. Such exchange controls could potentially impact our ability, in both the short and long term, to recover both the cost of our investment and earnings from that investment. We face competition from other specialty chemical companies.  We operate in a highly competitive marketplace. Our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop andcommercialize new and innovative, high value-added products for existing and future customers. Increased competition from existing or newly developed products offered by our competitors or companies whose products offer a similar functionality asour products may negatively affect demand for our products. In addition, actions by our competitors could affect our ability to maintain or raise prices, successfully enter new markets or maintain or grow our market position. Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results. As more fully described in Item 3Legal Proceedings, we are a party to or the subject of lawsuits, claims, and proceedings,including, but not limited to, those involving environmental, and health and safety matters as well as product liability and personal injury claims relating to asbestosis, silicosis, and coal workers pneumoconiosis. We are also a potentiallyresponsible party in various environmental proceedings and remediation matters wherein substantial amounts are at issue. Adverse rulings, judgments or settlements in pending or future litigation (including liabilities associated with respiratorclaims) or in connection with environmental remediation activities could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in any forward-looking statements.  Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates could affect our financial results. We earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In fiscal 2014, wederived a majority of our revenues from sales outside the U.S. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars atexchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in countries where we operate will affect our results of operations and the value ofbalance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time. In addition, we are exposed to adverse changes in interestrates. We manage both these risks through normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative instruments as well as foreign currency debt. We cannot be certain, however, that we will be successfulin reducing the risks inherent in exposures to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.  There are also instances where we havedirect current exposures to foreign currency movements because settlement back into a different currency is intended. These situations can have a direct impact on our cash flows.   17 Table of ContentsOur tax rate is dependent upon a number of factors, a change in any of which could impact our future tax rates andnet income.  Our future tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in tax laws or theinterpretation of such tax laws; changes in the estimated realization of our net deferred tax assets; the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previouslyprovided for U.S. income and non-U.S. withholding taxes; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes, including impairment of goodwill in connection withacquisitions; changes in available tax credits; and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities. Losses for which no tax benefits can be recorded could materially impact our tax rate and its volatility from onequarter to another. Any significant change in our jurisdictional earnings mix or in the tax laws in those jurisdictions could impact our future tax rates and net income in those periods.  We may be subject to information technology systems failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security.  We depend on integrated information systems to conduct our business. Information technology systems failures, including risks associated with upgrading our systems or in successfully integrating informationtechnology and other systems in connection with the integration of businesses we acquire, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions, our ability to protect customer orcompany information and our financial reporting. Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, could be damaged or interrupted by power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external securitybreaches, events such as fires, earthquakes, floods, tornadoes and hurricanes, and/or errors by our employees.

There are also regulatory developments in other regions and countries, including the U.S., Canada, China andBrazil, regarding greenhouse gas emission reduction programs. Those programs have not yet been defined and their potential impact on our manufacturing operations or financial results cannot be estimated at this time. Our restructuring activities and cost saving initiatives may not achieve the results we anticipate. We have undertaken and expect to continue to undertake cost reduction initiatives and organizational restructurings to improve operatingefficiencies, optimize our asset base and generate cost savings. For example, we are currently moving our European business service center operations from Leuven, Belgium to Riga, Latvia. We cannot be certain that we will be able to complete theseinitiatives as planned or without business interruption, or that the estimated operating efficiencies or cost savings from such activities will be fully realized or maintained over time.  The money we spend developing new businesses and technologies may not result in a proportional increase in our revenues or profits.  We cannot be certain that the costs we incur investing in new businesses and technologies will result in a proportional increase in revenues or profits. In addition, the timely commercialization of products that weare developing may be disrupted or delayed by manufacturing or other technical difficulties, market acceptance or insufficient market size to support a new product, competitors new products, and difficulties in moving from the experimentalstage to the production stage.

  Inaddition to factors described elsewhere in this report, the following are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. The risks described below are not the onlyrisks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations and financial results.  Negative or uncertain worldwide or regional economic conditions may adversely impact our business.  Our operations and performance are affected by worldwide and regional economic conditions. Continued uncertainty or a deterioration in the economic conditions affecting the businesses to which, or geographic areasin which, we sell products could reduce demand for our products, and we may experience pricing pressure on products and services, which could decrease our revenues and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. In addition,during periods of economic uncertainty, our customers may temporarily pursue inventory reduction measures that exceed declines in the actual underlying demand. Our businesses are sensitive to industry capacity utilization, particularly ReinforcementMaterials. As a result, pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur, which could affect our financial performance.  As achemical manufacturing company, our operations have the potential to cause environmental or other damage as well as personal injury. The operation of a chemical manufacturing business as well as the sale and distribution of chemical products involve safety, health andenvironmental risks. For example, the production and/or processing of carbon black, fumed metal oxides, aerogel, activated carbon and other chemicals involve the handling, transportation, manufacture or use of certain substances or components thatmay be considered toxic or hazardous. Our manufacturing processes and the transportation of chemical products entail risks such as leaks, fires, explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures or unscheduled downtime. If operational risksmaterialize, they could result in injury or loss of life, damage to the environment, or damage to property. In addition, the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may result in loss of production,which, in turn, may make it difficult for us to meet customer needs. Accordingly, these hazards and their consequences could negatively impact the Companys results of operations and cash flows, both during and after the period of operationaldifficulties, and could harm our reputation.  The strategic growth plan of the mercury removal products portion of our Purification Solutionsbusiness relies significantly on the enforcement of environmental laws and regulations.  The strategic growth plan for the mercuryremoval products and systems portion of our Purification Solutions business relies significantly upon the enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, particularly those that would require industrial facilities to reduce the quantity of airpollutants they release. In particular, we expect demand for our activated carbon products and systems to increase as coal fired utilities in the U.S. enhance their emission control systems in order to comply with the U.S. Mercury and Air ToxicsStandards (MATS), which sets forth federal mercury emission levels that will take effect in April 2015. However, because of the uncertainty associated with implementation of regulations and the potential for delays and challenges, we are unable topredict with certainty when and how MATS and other new standards will affect demand for our activated carbon products and systems.   15 Table of ContentsOur mining operations have the potential to cause safety issues, including those that could result in significantpersonal injury, and a disruption in our cesium mining operations could disrupt our supply of raw materials for our Specialty Fluids business.  We have underground cesium mining operations in Manitoba, Canada, and are developing an above-ground lignite mine close to our Marshall, Texas facility, which we expect will begin operations in fiscal 2015. Miningoperations by their nature are activities that involve a high level of uncertainty and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control. These operational risks include, but are not limited to, industrial accidents; unexpectedgeological conditions; fall of ground accidents or structural collapses; and lower than expected ore grades or recovery rate. The failure to adequately manage these risks could result in significant personal injury, loss of life, damage to mineralproperties, production facilities or mining equipment, damage to the environment, delays in or reduced production, and potential legal liabilities.  The principal raw material used by our Specialty Fluids business is pollucite (cesium ore), the vast majority of which we obtain from our mine in Manitoba, a portion of which is located under Bernic Lake. In March2013, a fall of ground occurred in an area of the mine where there had previously been a fall of ground in 2010. Following the March 2013 fall of ground, we implemented additional safety measures and several types of monitoring devices in the mine,based on the advice of our third-party mining consultants. Since their implementation in July 2013, the monitoring devices have indicated good structural stability in the mine, and we have resumed normal mining activities with respect to the areasnot affected by the fall of ground. The structural stability may be subject to change at any time, including the potential for further deterioration and flooding, even in the near term. We are assessing development alternatives that, if pursued, webelieve will enable us to continue to access our pollucite reserves and expand our existing mining operations. At this stage, it is not possible to be certain of the technical feasibility or the potential cost of such project. In addition, if weproceed with this project, we expect it will take two or more years to complete, and there remains a risk of further deterioration of the mine over this period of time. Further, this project could experience unexpected cost increases or problems ordelays, including delays in obtaining environmental or other government approvals. As we assess these alternatives, our existing mining operations in certain portions of the mine continue, and we are increasing our cesium ore inventory in an effortto ensure that we have sufficient raw material inventory to meet our customer needs for the foreseeable future. If we are unable to continue mining or unwilling to incur the costs associated with further developing the mine, we may be unable toobtain additional raw material for our Specialty Fluids business at an acceptable cost or at all.  Our operations are subject to extensive safety,health and environmental requirements, which could increase our costs and/or reduce our profit.  Our ongoing operations are subjectto extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety, health and environmental matters, many of which provide for substantial monetary fines and criminal sanctions for violations. Theserequirements include requirements to obtain and comply with various environmental-related permits for constructing any new facilities and operating all of our existing facilities. The enactment of new environmental laws and regulations and/or themore aggressive interpretation of existing requirements could require us to incur significant costs for compliance or capital improvements or limit our current or planned operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our earningsor cash flow. See Item 3 Legal ProceedingsEnvironmental Proceedings.  Any failure to realize benefits from acquisitions,alliances or joint ventures could adversely affect future financial results.  Attainment of our strategic plan objectives requires,in part, strategic acquisitions or joint ventures intended to complement or expand our businesses globally or add product technology that accelerates our specialization strategy, or both. The success of acquisitions of businesses, new technologiesand products,   16 Table of Contentsor arrangements with third parties is not always predictable and we may not be successful in realizing our objectives as anticipated. We may not be able to integrate any acquired businessessuccessfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business results. Plant capacity expansions and site development projects may be delayed and/or not achieve the expected benefits. Our ability to complete capacity expansions and other site development projects as planned may be delayed or interrupted by the need to obtainenvironmental and other regulatory approvals, unexpected cost increases, availability of labor and materials, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. Moreover, the cost ofthese activities could have a negative impact on the financial performance of the relevant business, and in the case of capacity expansion projects, until capacity utilization at the particular facility is sufficient to absorb the incremental costsassociated with the expansion. In addition, our ability to expand capacity in emerging regions depends in part on economic and political conditions in these regions and, in some cases, on our ability to establish operations, construct additionalmanufacturing capacity or form strategic business alliances.  An interruption in our operations as a result of fence-line arrangements could disruptour manufacturing operations and adversely affect our financial results.  At certain of our facilities we have fence-linearrangements with adjacent third party manufacturing operations (fence-line partners), who provide raw materials for our manufacturing operations and/or take by-products generated from our operations. Accordingly, any unplanneddisruptions or curtailments in a fence-line partners production facilities that impacts their ability to supply us with raw materials or to take our manufacturing by-products could disrupt our manufacturing operations or cause us to incurincreased operating costs to mitigate such disruption.  Volatility in the price of energy and raw materials could decrease our margins. Our manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of energy and raw materials, the costs of which are subject to worldwidesupply and demand as well as other factors beyond our control. Dramatic increases in such costs or decreases in the availability of raw materials at acceptable costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, movementsin the market price for crude oil typically affect carbon black feedstock costs. Significant movements in the market price for crude oil tend to create volatility in our carbon black feedstock costs, which can affect our working capital and resultsof operations. Certain of our carbon black supply contracts contain provisions that adjust prices to account for changes in a relevant feedstock price index. We attempt to offset the effects of increases in raw material costs through selling priceincreases in our non-contract sales, productivity improvements and cost reduction efforts. Success in offsetting increased raw material costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could varysignificantly depending on the segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased raw material and energy costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales. Ifwe are not able to fully offset the effects of increased raw material or energy costs, it could have a significant impact on our financial results. We are exposed to political or country risk inherent in doing business in some countries. Sales outside of the U.S. constituted a majority of our revenues in fiscal 2013. Although much of our international business is currently in regionswhere the political and economic risk levels and established legal systems are similar to those in the United States, we also conduct business in countries that have less stable legal systems and financial markets, and potentially more corruptbusiness environments than the U.S. Our operations in some countries may be subject to the following risks: changes in the rate of   17 Table of Contentseconomic growth; unsettled political or economic conditions; possible expropriation or other governmental actions; corruption by government officials and other third parties; social unrest, war,terrorist activities or other armed conflict; confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; deprivation of contract rights; trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products; reduced protection of intellectual propertyrights; restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital; exchange controls; inflation; currency fluctuations and devaluation; the effect of global health, safety and environmental matters on economic conditions and market opportunities; andchanges in financial policy and availability of credit. We have an equity method investment in Venezuela, a country that has established rigid controls over the ability of foreign companies to repatriate cash. Such exchange controls couldpotentially impact our ability, in both the short and long term, to recover both the cost of our investment and earnings from that investment.  Asignificant adverse change in a customer relationship or the failure of a customer or other third party to perform its obligations under agreements with us could harm our business or cash flows. Our success in strengthening relationships and growing business with our largest customers and retaining their business over extended time periodscould affect our future results. We have a group of key customers across our businesses that together represent a significant portion of our total net sales and operating revenues. The loss of any of our important customers, or a reduction involumes sold to them, including because of a work stoppage or other disruption, could adversely affect our results of operations until such business is replaced or the disruption ends. Any deterioration in the financial condition of any of ourcustomers or the industries they serve that impairs our customers ability to make payments to us also could increase our uncollectible receivables and could affect our future results and financial condition. In addition, at times we havesignificant receivables from a limited number of customers and other parties, which concentration increases our credit risk.  We face competitionfrom other specialty chemical companies.  We operate in a highly competitive marketplace. Our ability to compete successfully dependsin part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize new and innovative, high value-added products for existing and future customers. Increased competition from existing ornewly developed products offered by our competitors or companies whose products offer a similar functionality as our products may negatively affect demand for our products. In addition, actions by our competitors could affect our ability to maintainor raise prices, successfully enter new markets or maintain or grow our market position.  Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interestrates could affect our financial results.  We earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries usingcurrencies other than the U.S. dollar. In fiscal 2013, we derived a majority of our revenues from sales outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, incomeand expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in countrieswhere we operate will affect our results of operations and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in othersover time. In addition, we are exposed to adverse changes in interest rates. We manage both these risks through normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative instruments as well as foreigncurrency debt. We cannot be certain, however, that we will be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.   18 Table of ContentsThere are also instances where we have direct current exposures to foreign currency movements becausesettlement back into a different currency is intended. These situations can have a direct impact on our cash flows.  The money we spend developingnew businesses and technologies may not result in a proportional increase in our revenues or profits.  We cannot be certain that thecosts we incur investing in new businesses and technologies will result in a proportional increase in revenues or profits. In addition, the timely commercialization of products that we are developing may be disrupted or delayed by manufacturing orother technical difficulties, market acceptance or insufficient market size to support a new product, competitors new products, and difficulties in moving from the experimental stage to the production stage. These disruptions or delays couldaffect our future business results.  Our tax rate is dependent upon a number of factors, a change in any of which could impact our future tax ratesand net income.  Our future tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the enactment of certain taxlegislation being considered in the U.S.; other changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws; changes in the estimated realization of our net deferred tax assets; the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned andtaxed; the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. income and non-U.S. withholding taxes; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses that are notdeductible for tax purposes, including impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions; changes in available tax credits; and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities. Losses for which no tax benefits canbe recorded could materially impact our tax rate and its volatility from one quarter to another. Any significant change in our jurisdictional earnings mix or in the tax laws in those jurisdictions could impact our future tax rates and net income inthose periods.  Regulations requiring a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions impact our carbon black and activated carbon operations. Global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions impact the carbon black and activated carbon industries ascarbon dioxide is emitted from those manufacturing processes. The European Commissions Emissions Trading Scheme applies to our carbon black and activated carbon facilities in Europe, and we generally expect to purchase emission credits wherenecessary to respond to allocation shortfalls. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to purchase emissions credits if our carbon black or activated carbon operations generate more CO2 than our allocations permit or that the cost of such credits will be acceptable to us. There are also regulatory developments inother regions and countries, including the U.S., Canada, China and Brazil, regarding greenhouse gas emission reduction programs. Those programs have not yet been defined and their potential impact on our manufacturing operations or financial resultscannot be estimated at this time.  Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect ourfinancial results.  As more fully described in Item 3Legal Proceedings, we are a party to or the subject oflawsuits, claims, and proceedings, including, but not limited to, those involving environmental, and health and safety matters as well as product liability and personal injury claims relating to asbestosis, silicosis, and coal workerspneumoconiosis, and exposure to various chemicals. We are also a potentially responsible party in various environmental proceedings and remediation matters wherein substantial amounts are at issue. Adverse rulings, judgments or settlements inpending or future litigation (including liabilities associated with respirator claims) or in connection with environmental remediation activities could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in any forward-lookingstatements.   19 Table of ContentsOur restructuring activities and cost saving initiatives may not achieve the results we anticipate. We have undertaken and will continue to undertake cost reduction initiatives and organizational restructurings to improve operating efficiencies,optimize our asset base and generate cost savings. We cannot be certain that we will be able to complete these initiatives as planned or that the estimated operating efficiencies or cost savings from such activities will be fully realized ormaintained over time. In addition, when we close manufacturing facilities, we may not be successful in migrating our customers from those closed facilities to our other facilities.  The reduction or elimination of tariffs placed on U.S. and European imports of Chinese or other foreign activated carbon could have a material adverse effect on Purification Solutions. Purification Solutions faces pressure and competition in its U.S. and European markets from low-priced imports of activated carbon products that arefrequently sold at less than fair value in the market. If the amounts of these low-priced imports increase, especially if they are sold at less than fair value, our sales of those products could decline, which could have an adverse effect on theearnings of Purification Solutions. In addition, sales of these low-priced imports may make it more difficult for Purification Solutions to pass through raw material cost increases to its customers. U.S. and European regulatory agencies have enactedantidumping duties to limit these activities. However, the antidumping duties in the U.S. could be reduced or eliminated in the future, and the antidumping duties in the European Union may not be renewed beyond their current term. If theseantidumping duties are reduced or eliminated, the volume of low-priced activated carbon imports in the U.S and the European Union could increase and, therefore, reduce demand or pricing for our products. The continued protection of our patents, trade secrets and other proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success. Our patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and competitive position. We own various patents andother intellectual property rights in the U.S. and other countries covering many of our products, as well as processes and product uses. Where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable, we rely on trade secret laws and practicesto protect our proprietary technology and processes, such as physical security, limited dissemination and access and confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, consultants, business partners, potential licensees and others to protectour trade secrets and other proprietary information. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect and the protective measures we have put in place may not prevent disclosure or unauthorized use of our proprietary information or provide anadequate remedy in the event of misappropriation or other violations of our proprietary rights. In addition, we are a licensee of various patents and intellectual property rights belonging to others in the U.S. and other countries. Because the lawsand enforcement mechanisms of some countries may not allow us to protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as we are able to do in the U.S., the strength of our intellectual property rights will vary from country to country. Irrespective of our proprietary intellectual property rights, we may be subject to claims that our products, processes or product uses infringe theintellectual property rights of others. These claims, even if they are without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend and if we were to lose such claims, we could be enjoined from selling our products or using our processes and/or besubject to damages, or be required to enter into licensing agreements requiring royalty payments and/or use restrictions. Licensing agreements may not be available to us, or if available, may not be available on acceptable terms.   20 Table of ContentsWe may be required to impair or write off certain assets if our assumptions about future sales and profitabilityprove incorrect.  In analyzing the value of our inventory, property, plant and equipment, investments, goodwill and intangibleassets, we have made assumptions about future sales (pricing and volume), production, costs and cash generation, and market conditions. These assumptions are based on managements best estimates and if the actual results differ significantlyfrom these assumptions, we may not be able to realize the value of the assets recorded as of September 30, 2013, which could lead to an impairment or write-off of certain of these assets in the future. In particular, our assumptions concerningfuture growth of the Purification Solutions business, which had $466 million of goodwill at September 30, 2013, are highly dependent on growth in the mercury removal products portion of this business. This growth relies upon the adoption andenforcement of environmental laws and regulations, particularly those requiring U.S.-based coal fired utilities to reduce mercury emissions to comply with MATS by April 2015. A delay in the implementation of these regulations or an extension of timefor compliance could negatively affect our growth assumptions.  We may be subject to information technology systems failures, network disruptions andbreaches of data security.  We depend on integrated information systems to conduct our business. Information technology systemsfailures, including risks associated with upgrading our systems or in successfully integrating information technology and other systems in connection with the integration of businesses we acquire, network disruptions and breaches of data securitycould disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions, our ability to protect customer or company information and our financial reporting. Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, could be damaged or interrupted bypower outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, events such as fires, earthquakes, floods, tornadoes and hurricanes, and/or errors by our employees. Although we have taken steps toaddress these concerns by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control measures and back-up systems at multiple sites, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverseeffect on our financial condition and results of operations.  Natural disasters could affect our operations and financial results. We operate facilities in areas of the world that are exposed to natural hazards, such as floods, windstorms and earthquakes. Such events coulddisrupt our supply of raw materials or otherwise affect production, transportation and delivery of our products or affect demand for our products.   "
2,CBT,CABOT CORP,2012-11-29,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
  In addition to factors described elsewhere in this report, the following are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-lookingstatements. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations and financial results. Negative or uncertain worldwide or regional economic conditions may adversely impact our business. Our operations and performance are affected by worldwide and regional economic conditions. Continuing concerns over the worldwide economicoutlook and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe have contributed to diminished expectations for global economic growth. Continued uncertainty or a deterioration in the economic conditions affecting the businesses to which, or geographic areas inwhich, we sell products could reduce demand for our products, and we may experience pricing pressure on products and services, which could decrease our revenues and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. In addition,during periods of economic uncertainty, our customers may temporarily pursue inventory reduction measures that exceed declines in the actual underlying demand. Our businesses are sensitive to industry capacity utilization, particularly inReinforcement Materials. As a result, pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur, which could affect our financial performance.   14 Table of ContentsPlant capacity expansions may be delayed and/or not achieve the expected benefits. Our ability to complete capacity expansions as planned may be delayed or interrupted by the need to obtain environmental and otherregulatory approvals, availability of labor and materials, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. In addition, our ability to expand capacity in emerging regions depends inpart on economic and political conditions in these regions and, in some cases, on our ability to establish operations, construct additional manufacturing capacity or form strategic business alliances. Moreover, the cost of expanding capacity inReinforcement Materials, Specialty Carbons and Compounds, Fumed Metal Oxides, Purification Solutions, and Inkjet Colorants could have a negative impact on the financial performance of these businesses until capacity utilization is sufficient toabsorb the incremental costs associated with the expansion.  As a chemical manufacturing company, our operations have the potential tocause environmental or other damage as well as personal injury.  The operation of a chemical manufacturing business as wellas the sale and distribution of chemical products involve safety, health and environmental risks. For example, the production and/or processing of carbon black, fumed metal oxides, aerogel, activated carbon and other chemicals involve the handling,transportation, manufacture or use of certain substances or components that may be considered toxic or hazardous within the meaning of applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety, healthand environmental matters. The transportation of chemical products and other activities associated with our manufacturing processes have the potential to cause environmental or other damage as well as injury or death to employees or third parties.We could incur significant expenditures in connection with such operational risks.  Our operations are subject to extensive safety, healthand environmental requirements, which could increase our costs and/or reduce our profit.  Our ongoing operations aresubject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety, health and environmental matters, many of which provide for substantial monetary fines and criminal sanctions for violations. Theserequirements include requirements to obtain and comply with various environmental-related permits for constructing any new facilities and operating all of our existing facilities. The enactment of new environmental laws and regulations and/or themore aggressive interpretation of existing requirements could require us to incur significant costs for compliance or capital improvements or limit our current or planned operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our earningsor cash flow. See Item 3Legal ProceedingsEnvironmental Proceedings.  We may not realize the expected benefits from ouracquisition of Norit.  With our acquisition of Norit, we have entered into a new area of the specialty chemicals businessand there may be factors that affect this business with which we are not as familiar compared with our other existing businesses. We may not be successful retaining key customers and suppliers or key technical or other employees of the former Noritbusiness, including those with knowledge of the activated carbon industry and activated carbon manufacturing processes. This integration requires significant attention from our management. The diversion of our managements attention away fromour other businesses and any difficulties encountered in the integration process, including those related to the integration of information technology and other systems, could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the strategicgrowth plan for the mercury removal products and services portion of this business relies significantly upon the enforcement of restrictive environmental laws and regulations, particularly those that would require industrial facilities to reduce thequantity of air pollutants they release. Because of the uncertainty associated with the regulatory process, we are unable to predict with certainty when and how these new standards will affect demand for our activated carbon products.    15 Table of ContentsAny failure to realize benefits from acquisitions, alliances or joint ventures could adversely affectfuture financial results.  As part of our strategies for growth and improved profitability, we have made and may continueto make acquisitions and investments and enter into joint ventures. The success of acquisitions of new technologies, companies and products, or arrangements with third parties is not always predictable and we may not be successful in realizing ourobjectives as anticipated. We may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, whichcould adversely affect our business.  An interruption in our operations as a result of fence-line arrangements could disrupt ourmanufacturing operations and adversely affect our financial results.  At certain of our facilities we have fence-linearrangements with adjacent third party manufacturing operations (fence-line partners), who provide raw materials for our manufacturing operations and/or take by-products generated from our operations. Accordingly, any unplanneddisruptions or curtailments in a fence-line partners production facilities that impacts their ability to supply us with raw materials or to take our manufacturing by-products could disrupt our manufacturing operations or cause us to incurincreased operating costs to mitigate such disruption.  Volatility in the price of energy and raw materials could decrease our margins. Our manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of energy and raw materials, the costs of which are subject toworldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond our control. Dramatic increases in such costs or decreases in the availability of raw materials at acceptable costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. For example,movements in the market price for crude oil typically affect carbon black feedstock costs. Significant movements in the market price for crude oil tend to create volatility in our carbon black feedstock costs, which can affect our working capitaland results of operations. Certain of our carbon black supply contracts contain provisions that adjust prices to account for changes in a relevant feedstock price index. We attempt to offset the effects of increases in raw material costs throughselling price increases in our non-contract sales, productivity improvements and cost reduction efforts. Success in offsetting increased raw material costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and couldvary significantly depending on the segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased raw material and energy costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales.If we are not able to fully offset the effects of increased raw material or energy costs, it could have a significant impact on our financial results.  We are exposed to political or country risk inherent in doing business in some countries.  Sales outside of the U.S. constituted a majority of our revenues in fiscal 2012. Although much of our international business is currently in regions where the political and economic risk levels andestablished legal systems are similar to those in the United States, we also conduct business in countries that have less stable legal systems and financial markets, and potentially more corrupt business environments than the U.S. Our operations insome countries may be subject to the following risks: changes in the rate of economic growth; unsettled political or economic conditions; possible expropriation or other governmental actions; corruption by government officials and other thirdparties; social unrest, war, terrorist activities or other armed conflict; confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; deprivation of contract rights; trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products; reducedprotection of intellectual property rights; restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital; exchange controls; inflation; currency fluctuations and devaluation; the effect of global health, safety and environmental matters on economicconditions and market opportunities; and changes in financial policy and availability of credit. We have an   16 Table of Contentsequity method investment in Venezuela, a country that has established rigid controls over the ability of foreign companies to repatriate cash. Such exchange controls could potentially impact ourability, in both the short and long term, to recover both the cost of our investment and earnings from that investment.  We depend on agroup of key customers for a significant portion of our sales. A significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customers performance or financial position could harm our business and financial condition. Our success in strengthening relationships and growing business with our largest customers and retaining their business over extended timeperiods could affect our future results. We have a group of key customers across our businesses that together represent a significant portion of our total net sales and operating revenues. The loss of any of our important customers, or a reductionin volumes sold to them because of a work stoppage or other disruption, could adversely affect our results of operations until such business is replaced or the disruption ends. Any deterioration in the financial condition of any of our customers orthe industries they serve that impairs our customers ability to make payments to us also could increase our uncollectible receivables and could affect our future results and financial condition. Our failure to successfully develop new products and technologies that address our customers changing requirements or competitive challenges mayhave a negative effect on our business results.  The end markets into which we sell our products are subject to periodictechnological change, ongoing product improvements and changes in customer requirements. Increased competition from existing or newly developed products offered by our competitors or companies whose products offer a similar functionality as ourproducts may negatively affect demand for our products. We work to identify, develop and market innovative products on a timely basis to meet our customers changing requirements and competitive challenges. If we fail to develop new products orkeep pace with technological developments, our sales may be negatively impacted and our business results could be adversely affected. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates could affect our financial results. We earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In fiscal 2012,we derived a majority of our revenues from sales outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, intoU.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in countries where we operate will affect our results of operationsand the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time. In addition, we are exposed to adverse changesin interest rates. We manage both these risks through normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative instruments as well as foreign currency debt. We cannot be certain, however, that we will besuccessful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.  There are alsoinstances where we have direct current exposures to foreign currency movements because settlement back into a different currency is intended. These situations can have a direct impact on our cash flows. The money we spend developing new businesses and technologies may not result in a proportional increase in our revenues or profits. We cannot be certain that the costs we incur investing in new businesses and technologies will result in a proportional increase inrevenues or profits. In addition, the timely commercialization of products that we are developing may be disrupted or delayed by manufacturing or other technical difficulties, market   17 Table of Contentsacceptance or insufficient market size to support a new product, competitors new products, and difficulties in moving from the experimental stage to the production stage. These disruptionsor delays could affect our future business results.  Our tax rate is dependent upon a number of factors, a change in any of which couldimpact our future tax rates and net income.  Our future tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors,including the enactment of tax legislation currently being considered in the U.S.; other changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws; changes in the estimated realization of our net deferred tax assets; the jurisdictions in whichprofits are determined to be earned and taxed; the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. income and non-U.S. withholding taxes; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;increases in expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes, including impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions; changes in available tax credits; and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities.Losses for which no tax benefits can be recorded could materially impact our tax rate and its volatility from one quarter to another. Any significant change in our jurisdictional earnings mix or in the tax laws in those jurisdictions could impactour future tax rates and net income in those periods.  Regulations requiring a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions will likely impact ourcarbon black and activated carbon operations.  Global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissionsimpact the carbon black and activated carbon industries as carbon dioxide is emitted in those manufacturing processes. The European Commissions Emissions Trading Scheme applies to a number of our carbon black and activated carbon facilities,and we generally expect to purchase emission credits where necessary to respond to allocation shortfalls. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to purchase emissions credits if our carbon black or activated carbon operationsgenerate more CO2 than our allocations permit or that thecost of such credits will be acceptable to us. There are also ongoing discussions in other regions and countries, including the U.S., Canada, China and Brazil, regarding greenhouse gas emission reduction programs, but those programs have not yetbeen defined and their potential impact on our manufacturing operations or financial results cannot be estimated at this time.  Litigationor legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results.  As morefully described in Item 3Legal Proceedings, we are a party to or the subject of lawsuits, claims, and proceedings, including those involving environmental, and health and safety matters as well as product liability and personalinjury claims relating to asbestosis, silicosis, and coal workers pneumoconiosis, and exposure to various chemicals. We are also a potentially responsible party in various environmental proceedings and remediation matters wherein substantialamounts are at issue. Adverse rulings, judgments or settlements in pending or future litigation (including liabilities associated with respirator claims) or in connection with environmental remediation activities could cause our results to differmaterially from those expressed or forecasted in any forward-looking statements.  Our restructuring activities and cost saving initiativesmay not achieve the results we anticipate.  We have undertaken and will continue to undertake cost reduction initiativesand organizational restructurings to improve operating efficiencies, optimize our asset base and generate cost savings. We cannot be certain that we will be able to complete these initiatives as planned or that the estimated operating efficienciesor cost savings from such activities will be fully realized or maintained over time. In addition, when we close manufacturing facilities, we may not be successful in migrating our customers from those closed facilities to our other facilities.    18 Table of ContentsThe reduction or elimination of tariffs placed on U.S. and European imports of Chinese or other foreignactivated carbon could have a material adverse effect on Purification Solutions.  Purification Solutions faces pressure andcompetition in its U.S. and European markets from imports of activated carbon products that are sold at unfairly low prices. In some end-markets, low-priced imports have become accepted as viable alternatives to our products because they arefrequently sold at less than fair value in the market. If the amounts and acceptance of these low-priced imports increase, especially if they are sold at less than fair value, our sales of those products could decline, which could have an adverseeffect on the earnings of Purification Solutions. In addition, sales of these low-priced imports may make it more difficult for Purification Solutions to pass through raw material cost increases to its customers. U.S. and European regulatoryagencies have enacted antidumping duties to limit these activities. However, the antidumping duties in the U.S. could be reduced or eliminated in the future, and the antidumping duties in the European Union may or may not be renewed beyond 2013. Ifthese antidumping duties are reduced or eliminated, the volume of low-priced activated carbon imports in the U.S and the European Union could increase and, therefore, reduce demand or pricing for our products and services. The continued protection of our patents, trade secrets and other proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success. Our patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and competitive position.We own various patents and other intellectual property rights in the U.S. and other countries covering many of our products, as well as processes and product uses. Where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable, we rely on tradesecret laws and practices to protect our proprietary technology and processes, such as physical security, limited dissemination and access and confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, consultants, business partners, potentiallicensees and others to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect and the protective measures we have put in place may not prevent disclosure or unauthorized use of ourproprietary information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of misappropriation or other violations of our proprietary rights. In addition, we are a licensee of various patents and intellectual property rights belonging to others in the U.S.and other countries. Because the laws and enforcement mechanisms of some countries may not allow us to protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as we are able to in the U.S., the strength of our intellectual property rights will vary fromcountry to country.  Irrespective of our proprietary intellectual property rights, we may be subject to claims that ourproducts, processes or product uses infringe the intellectual property rights of others. These claims, even if they are without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend and if we were to lose such claims, we could be enjoined fromselling our products or using our processes and/or be subject to damages, or be required to enter into licensing agreements requiring royalty payments and/or use restrictions. Licensing agreements may not be available to us, and if available, maynot be available on acceptable terms.  We may be required to impair or write off certain assets if our assumptions about future sales andprofitability prove incorrect.  In analyzing the value of our inventory, property, plant and equipment, investments andintangible assets, we have made assumptions about future sales (pricing and volume), costs and cash generation. These assumptions are based on managements best estimates and if the actual results differ significantly from these assumptions, wemay not be able to realize the value of the assets recorded as of September 30, 2012, which could lead to an impairment or write-off of certain of these assets in the future.   19 Table of ContentsOn occasion we enter into derivative contracts with financial counterparties. The effectiveness of thesecontracts is dependent on the ability of these financial counterparties to perform their obligations and their nonperformance could harm our financial condition.  We have entered into interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency derivatives as part of our financial strategy. The effectiveness of our hedging programs using these instruments is dependent, inpart, upon the counterparties to these contracts honoring their financial obligations. If any of our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations in the future, we could be exposed to increased earnings and cash flow volatility due to aninstruments failure to hedge a financial risk.  We may be subject to information technology systems failures, network disruptions andbreaches of data security.  Information technology systems failures, including risks associated with upgrading our systems,network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions, our ability to protect customer or company information and our financial reporting. Our computer systems, including ourback-up systems, could be damaged or interrupted by power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, events such as fires, earthquakes, floods, tornadoes and hurricanes, and/or errorsby our employees. Although we have taken steps to address these concerns by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control measures and back-up systems at multiple sites, there can be no assurance that a system failure or datasecurity breach will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  Natural disasters couldaffect our operations and financial results.  We operate facilities in areas of the world that are exposed to naturalhazards, such as floods, windstorms and earthquakes. Such events could disrupt our supply of raw materials or otherwise affect production, transportation and delivery of our products or affect demand for our products.  "
6,CBT,CABOT CORP,2011-11-29,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
  In addition to factors described elsewhere in this report, the following are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-lookingstatements. It is not possible, however, to predict or identify all such factors. Accordingly, investors should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. Negative or uncertain worldwide or regional economic conditions may adversely impact our business. Our operations and performance are affected by worldwide and regional economic conditions. In periods of significant market turmoil andfinancial market uncertainty, we may experience pricing pressure on products and services and reduced business activity at a regional or global level. An economic downturn may reduce demand for our products, which could decrease our revenues andcould have an adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. In addition, during periods of economic uncertainty, our customers may temporarily pursue inventory reduction measures that exceed declines in the actual underlying demand. Our Rubber Blacks Business is sensitive to changes in industry capacity utilization. As a result, we may experience pricingpressure when capacity utilization in this Business decreases, which could affect our financial performance.  Plant capacity expansions maybe delayed and/or not achieve the expected benefits.  Our ability to complete capacity expansions as planned may be delayedor interrupted by the need to obtain environmental and other regulatory approvals, availability of labor and materials, unforeseen hazards   14 Table of Contentssuch as weather conditions, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. In addition, our ability to expand capacity in emerging regions depends in part on economic andpolitical conditions in these regions and, in some cases, on our ability to establish operations, construct additional manufacturing capacity or form strategic business alliances. Moreover, the cost of expanding capacity in our Rubber Blacks,Performance Products, Fumed Metal Oxides and Inkjet Businesses could have a negative impact on the financial performance of these businesses until capacity utilization is sufficient to absorb the incremental costs associated with the expansion. As a chemical manufacturing company, our operations have the potential to cause environmental or other damage as well as personal injury. The operation of a chemical manufacturing business as well as the sale and distribution of chemical products involvesafety, health and environmental risks. For example, the production and/or processing of carbon black, fumed metal oxides, aerogel and other chemicals involve the handling, transportation, manufacture or use of certain substances or components thatmay be considered toxic or hazardous within the meaning of applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety, health and environmental matters. The transportation of chemical products andother activities associated with our manufacturing processes have the potential to cause environmental or other damage as well as injury or death to employees or third parties. We could incur significant expenditures in connection with suchoperational risks.  Our operations are subject to extensive safety, health and environmental requirements, which could increase our costsand/or reduce our profit.  Our ongoing operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws,regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety, health and environmental matters (SH&E Requirements), many of which provide for substantial monetary fines and criminal sanctions for violations. These SH&E Requirementsinclude requirements to obtain and comply with various environmental-related permits for constructing any new facilities and operating all of our existing facilities. In June 2009, we received an information request from the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) as part of an EPA national initiative focused on the U.S. carbon black manufacturing sector. The information request relates to our Pampa, Texas facilitys compliance with certain regulatory and permittingrequirements under the Clean Air Act, including the New Source Review (NSR) construction permitting requirements. We responded to EPAs information request in August 2009 and are in discussions with EPA. Based on how EPA has handledsimilar NSR initiatives with other industrial sectors, it is anticipated that EPA will seek to require us to employ additional technology control devices or approaches with respect to emissions at certain U.S. facilities and/or seek a civil penaltyfrom us.  We believe that our ongoing operations comply with current SH&E Requirements in a manner that should notmaterially adversely affect our earnings or cash flow. We cannot be certain, however, that significant costs or liabilities will not be incurred with respect to SH&E Requirements and our operations. Moreover, we are not able to predict whetherfuture changes or developments in SH&E Requirements will affect our earnings or cash flow in a materially adverse manner.  Any failureto realize benefits from acquisitions, alliances or joint ventures could adversely affect future financial results.  Aspart of our strategies for growth and improved profitability, we have made and may continue to make acquisitions and investments and enter into joint ventures. The success of acquisitions of new technologies, companies and products, or arrangementswith third parties is not always predictable and we may not be successful in realizing our objectives as anticipated. We may not be able to integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable,or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business.   15 Table of ContentsWe are exposed to political or country risk inherent in doing business in some countries. Sales outside of the U.S. constituted a majority of our revenues in fiscal 2011. Our operations in some countries may be subject to thefollowing risks: changes in the rate of economic growth; unsettled political or economic conditions; possible expropriation or other governmental actions; social unrest, war, terrorist activities or other armed conflict; confiscatory taxation orother adverse tax policies; deprivation of contract rights; trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital;exchange controls; inflation; currency fluctuations and devaluation; the effect of global health, safety and environmental matters on economic conditions and market opportunities; and changes in financial policy and availability of credit. We havean equity method investment in Venezuela, a country that has established rigid controls over the ability of foreign companies to repatriate cash. Such exchange controls could potentially impact our ability, in both the short and long term, torecover both the cost of our investment and earnings from that investment.  Volatility in the price of energy and raw materials coulddecrease our margins.  Our manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of energy and raw materials, the costs ofwhich are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond our control. Dramatic increases in such costs or decreases in the availability of raw materials at acceptable costs could have an adverse effect on our results ofoperations. For example, movements in the market price for crude oil typically affect carbon black feedstock costs. Significant movements in the market price for crude oil tend to create volatility in our carbon black feedstock costs, which canaffect our working capital and results of operations. Certain of our carbon black supply contracts contain provisions that adjust prices to account for changes in a relevant feedstock price index. We attempt to offset the effects of increases in rawmaterial costs through selling price increases in our non-contract sales, productivity improvements and cost reduction efforts. Success in offsetting increased raw material costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economicconditions and could vary significantly depending on the segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased raw material and energy costs or may decrease demand for our products andour volume of sales. If we are not able to fully offset the effects of increased raw material or energy costs, it could have a significant impact on our financial results.  We depend on a group of key customers for a significant portion of our sales. A significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customers performance or financial position couldharm our business and financial condition.  Our success in strengthening relationships and growing business with ourlargest customers and retaining their business over extended time periods could affect our future results. We have a group of key customers across our businesses that together represent a significant portion of our total net sales and operatingrevenues. The loss of any of our important customers, or a reduction in volumes sold to them because of a work stoppage or other disruption, could adversely affect our results of operations until such business is replaced or the disruption ends. Anydeterioration in the financial condition of any of our customers or the industries they serve that impairs our customers ability to make payments to us also could increase our uncollectible receivables and could affect our future results andfinancial condition.  Our failure to successfully develop new products and technologies that address our customers changingrequirements or competitive challenges may have a negative effect on our business results.  The end markets into which wesell our products are subject to periodic technological change, ongoing product improvements and changes in customer requirements. Increased competition from existing or newly developed products offered by our competitors or companies whose productsoffer a similar functionality as our products may negatively affect demand for our products. We work to identify, develop and market   16 Table of Contentsinnovative products on a timely basis to meet our customers changing requirements and competitive challenges. If we fail to develop new products or keep pace with technologicaldevelopments, our sales may be negatively impacted and our business results could be adversely affected.  Fluctuations in foreign currencyexchange and interest rates could affect our financial results.  We earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incurliabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In fiscal 2011, we derived a majority of our revenues from sales outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we musttranslate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against othercurrencies in countries where we operate will affect our results of operations and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weaknesses in some currencies might be offsetby strengths in others over time. In addition, we are exposed to adverse changes in interest rates. We manage both these risks through normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative instrumentsas well as foreign currency debt. We cannot be certain, however, that we will be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations. There are also instances where we have direct current exposures to foreign currency movements because settlement back into a differentcurrency is intended. These situations can have a direct impact on our cash flows.  The money we spend developing new businesses andtechnologies may not result in a proportional increase in our revenues or profits.  We cannot be certain that the costs weincur investing in new businesses and technologies will result in a proportional increase in revenues or profits. In addition, the timely commercialization of products that we are developing may be disrupted or delayed by manufacturing or othertechnical difficulties, market acceptance or insufficient market size to support a new product, competitors new products, and difficulties in moving from the experimental stage to the production stage. These disruptions or delays could affectour future business results.  Our tax rate is dependent both upon the jurisdiction where our earnings arise and the tax laws in thosejurisdictions.  Our future tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the enactment of taxlegislation currently being considered in the U.S.; other changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws; changes in the estimated realization of our net deferred tax assets; the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earnedand taxed; the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. income and non-U.S. withholding taxes; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses that are notdeductible for tax purposes, including impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions; changes in available tax credits; and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities. Losses for which no tax benefits canbe recorded could materially impact our tax rate and its volatility from one quarter to another. Any significant change in our jurisdictional earnings mix or in the tax laws in those jurisdictions could impact our future tax rates and net income inthose periods.  Regulations requiring a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions will likely impact the carbon black industry, including ourcarbon black operations.  Carbon dioxide is emitted in the carbon black manufacturing process. In December 2005, theEuropean Commission (EC) published a directive that includes carbon black manufacturing in the combustion   17 Table of Contentssector and in Phase II of the Emissions Trading Scheme for the period 2008 to 2012. The EC is developing allowable emission credits for Phase III of the Emissions Trading Scheme, which will applyfor the period 2013 to 2020. Various European Union member states have included carbon black facilities in their national allocation plans and we have taken actions to comply with applicableCO2 emission requirements. However, there can be no assurancethat we will be able to purchase emissions credits if our carbon black operations generate more CO2 than our allocations permit or that the cost of such credits will be acceptable to us. There are also ongoing discussions in other regions and countries, including the U.S., Canada, China and Brazil,regarding greenhouse gas emission reduction programs, but those programs have not yet been defined and their potential impact on our manufacturing operations or financial results cannot be estimated at this time. Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results. As more fully described in Item 3Legal Proceedings, we are a party to or the subject of lawsuits, claims, andproceedings, including those involving contract, environmental, and health and safety matters as well as product liability and personal injury claims relating to asbestosis, silicosis, and coal workers pneumoconiosis, and exposure to variouschemicals. We are also a potentially responsible party in various environmental proceedings and remediation matters wherein substantial amounts are at issue. Adverse rulings, judgments or settlements in pending or future litigation (includingcontract litigation and liabilities associated with respirator claims) or in connection with environmental remediation activities could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in any forward-looking statements. Our restructuring activities and cost saving initiatives may not achieve the results we anticipate. We have undertaken and will continue to undertake cost reduction initiatives and organizational restructurings to optimize our asset base,improve operating efficiencies and generate cost savings. We cannot be certain that we will be able to complete these initiatives as planned or that the estimated operating efficiencies or cost savings from such activities will be fully realized ormaintained over time. In addition, when we close manufacturing facilities, we may not be successful in migrating our customers from those closed facilities to our other facilities.  We may be required to impair or write off certain assets if our assumptions about future sales and profitability prove incorrect. In analyzing the value of our inventory, property, plant and equipment, investments and intangible assets, we have made assumptions aboutfuture sales (pricing and volume), costs and cash generation. These assumptions are based on managements best estimates and if the actual results differ significantly from these assumptions, we may not be able to realize the value of theassets recorded as of September 30, 2011, which could lead to an impairment or write-off of certain of these assets in the future.  Onoccasion we enter into derivative contracts with financial counterparties. The effectiveness of these contracts is dependent on the ability of these financial counterparties to perform their obligations and their nonperformance could harm ourfinancial condition.  We have entered into interest rate swap contracts, foreign currency derivatives and forward commoditycontracts as part of our financial strategy. The effectiveness of our hedging programs using these instruments is dependent, in part, upon the counterparties to these contracts honoring their financial obligations. If any of our counterparties areunable to perform their obligations in the future, we could be exposed to increased earnings and cash flow volatility due to an instruments failure to hedge a financial risk.   18 Table of ContentsWe may be subject to information technology systems failures, network disruptions and breaches of datasecurity.  Information technology systems failures, including risks associated with upgrading our systems, networkdisruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions, our ability to protect customer or company information and our financial reporting. Our computer systems, including our back-upsystems, could be damaged or interrupted by power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, events such as fires, earthquakes, floods, tornadoes and hurricanes, and/or errors by ouremployees. Although we have taken steps to address these concerns by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control measures, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverseeffect on our financial condition and results of operations.  The continued protection of our patents and other proprietary intellectualproperty rights are important to our success.  Our patent and other intellectual property rights are important to oursuccess and competitive position. We own various patents and other intellectual property rights in the U.S. and other countries covering many of our products, as well as processes and product uses. In addition, we are a licensee of various patentsand intellectual property rights belonging to others in the U.S. and other countries. Because the laws and enforcement mechanisms of some countries may not allow us to protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as we are able to in the U.S.,the strength of our intellectual property rights will vary from country to country.  Irrespective of our proprietaryintellectual property rights, we may be subject to claims that our products, processes or product uses infringe the intellectual property rights of others. These claims, even if they are without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defendand if we were to lose such claims, we could be subject to injunctions and/or damages, or be required to enter into licensing agreements requiring royalty payments and/or use restrictions. Licensing agreements may not be available to us, and ifavailable, may not be available on acceptable terms.  Natural disasters could affect our operations and financial results. We operate facilities in areas of the world that are exposed to natural hazards, such as floods, windstorms and earthquakes. Such eventscould disrupt our supply of raw materials or otherwise affect production, transportation and delivery of our products or affect demand for our products.   "

  In addition to factors described elsewhere in this report, the following are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-lookingstatements. It is not possible, however, to predict or identify all such factors. Accordingly, investors should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. Changes in supply-demand balance in the regions and the industries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial results. Our key customers continue to shift their manufacturing capacity from mature markets such as North America and Western Europe to emergingregions such as Asia, South America and Eastern Europe. Although we are responding to meet these market demand conditions, we cannot be certain that we will be successful expanding capacity in emerging regions, which depends in part on economic andpolitical conditions in these regions and, in some cases, on our ability to establish operations, construct additional manufacturing capacity or form strategic business alliances. In addition, we may not be successful in reducing capacity in matureregions commensurate with industry demand. Similarly, demand for our customers products and our competitors reactions to market conditions could affect our financial results. In addition, our Rubber Blacks and Supermetals Businesses are sensitive to changes in industry capacity utilization. As a result, pricingtends to decrease when capacity utilization in these businesses decreases, which could affect our financial performance.  Volatility in theprice of raw materials or their reduced availability could decrease our margins.  Our manufacturing processes consumesignificant amounts of energy and raw materials, the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond our control.

A significant adverse change in a customer relationship orin a customers performance or financial position could harm our business and financial condition.  Our success instrengthening relationships and growing business with our largest customers and retaining their business over extended time periods could affect our future results. We have a group of key   14 Table of Contentscustomers across our businesses that together represent a significant portion of our total net sales and operating revenues. In fiscal 2010, sales to The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company by ourRubber Blacks Business accounted for approximately 11% of our consolidated revenues. The loss of any of our important customers, or a reduction in volumes sold to them because of a work stoppage or other disruption, could adversely affect ourresults of operations until such business is replaced or the disruption ends. Any deterioration in the financial condition of any of our customers or the industries they serve that impairs our customers ability to make payments to us alsocould increase our uncollectible receivables and could affect our future results and financial condition.  As a chemical manufacturingcompany, our operations have the potential to cause environmental or other damage as well as personal injury. In addition, our operations are subject to extensive safety, health and environmental requirements, which could increase our costs and/orreduce our profit.  Our ongoing operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations,rules and ordinances relating to safety, health and environmental matters (SH&E Requirements), many of which provide for substantial monetary fines and criminal sanctions for violations. These SH&E Requirements includerequirements to obtain and comply with various environmental-related permits for constructing any new facilities and operating all of our existing facilities. In June 2009, we received an information request from the U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency (EPA) as part of an EPA national initiative focused on the U.S. carbon black manufacturing sector. The information request relates to our Pampa, Texas facilitys compliance with certain regulatory and permitting requirementsunder the Clean Air Act, including the New Source Review (NSR) construction permitting requirements. We responded to EPAs information request in August 2009 and are in discussions with EPA. Based on how EPA has handled similar NSRinitiatives with other industrial sectors, it is possible that EPA could require us to employ additional technology control devices or approaches with respect to emissions at certain facilities and/or seek a civil penalty from us. The operation of a chemical manufacturing business as well as the sale and distribution of chemical products involve safety, health andenvironmental risks. For example, the production and/or processing of carbon black, fumed metal oxides, tantalum, niobium, aerogel and other chemicals involve the handling, transportation, manufacture or use of certain substances or components thatmay be considered toxic or hazardous within the meaning of applicable SH&E Requirements. The processing of tantalum ore also involves radioactive substances. The transportation of chemical products and other activities associated with ourmanufacturing processes have the potential to cause environmental or other damage as well as injury or death to employees or third parties. We could incur significant expenditures in connection with such operational risks. We believe that ourongoing operations comply with current SH&E Requirements in a manner that should not materially adversely affect our earnings or cash flow. We cannot be certain, however, that significant costs or liabilities will not be incurred with respect toSH&E Requirements and our operations. Moreover, we are not able to predict whether future changes or developments in SH&E Requirements will affect our earnings or cash flow in a materially adverse manner. Plant capacity expansions may be delayed and not achieve the expected benefits. Our ability to complete capacity expansions as planned may be delayed or interrupted by the need to obtain environmental and otherregulatory approvals, availability of labor and materials, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. Moreover, the cost of expanding capacity in our Rubber Blacks, PerformanceProducts and Fumed Metal Oxides Businesses could have a negative impact on the financial performance of these businesses until capacity utilization is sufficient to absorb the incremental costs associated with the expansion. Our restructuring activities and cost saving initiatives may not achieve the results we anticipate. We have undertaken and will continue to undertake cost reduction initiatives and organizational restructurings to optimize our asset base,improve operating efficiencies and generate cost savings. We   15 Table of Contentscannot be certain that we will be able to complete these initiatives as planned or that the estimated operating efficiencies or cost savings from such activities will be fully realized ormaintained over time. In addition, when we close manufacturing facilities, we may not be successful in migrating our customers from those closed facilities to our other facilities.  Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates could affect our financial results.  We earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In fiscal 2010, we derived a majority of our revenues from sales outside theUnited States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of eachreporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in countries where we operate will affect our results of operations and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies.These risks are non-cash exposures, and because of the geographic diversity of our operations, weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time. In addition, we are exposed to adverse changes in interest rates. Wemanage both these risks through normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative instruments as well as foreign currency debt. We cannot be certain, however, that we will be successful in reducingthe risks inherent in exposures to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.  There are also instances where we havedirect current exposures to foreign currency movements because settlement back into a different currency is intended. These situations can have a direct impact on our cash flows. Our most significant exposure relates to balances currently held inVenezuela at our holding companies.  We are exposed to political or country risk inherent in doing business in some countries. Sales outside of the U.S. constituted a majority of our revenues in fiscal 2010. Our operations in some countries may besubject to the following risks: changes in the rate of economic growth; unsettled political or economic conditions; possible expropriation or other governmental actions; social unrest, war, terrorist activities or other armed conflict; confiscatorytaxation or other adverse tax policies; deprivation of contract rights; trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; restrictions on the repatriation of income orcapital; exchange controls; inflation; currency fluctuations and devaluation; the effect of global health, safety and environmental matters on economic conditions and market opportunities; and changes in financial policy and availability of credit.We have an equity method investment in Venezuela, a country that has established very rigid controls over the ability of foreign companies to repatriate cash. Such exchange controls could potentially impact our ability, in both the short and longterm, to recover both the cost of our investment and earnings from that investment.  Our failure to successfully develop new products andtechnologies that address our customers changing requirements or competitive challenges may have a negative effect on our business results.  The end markets into which we sell our products are subject to periodic technological change, ongoing product improvements and changes in customer requirements. Increased competition from existing ornewly developed products offered by our competitors or companies whose products offer a similar functionality as our products may negatively affect demand for our products. We work to identify, develop and market innovative products on a timelybasis to meet our customers changing requirements and competitive challenges. If we fail to develop new products or keep pace with technological developments, our sales may be negatively impacted and our business results could be adverselyeffected.  The money we spend developing new businesses and technologies may not result in a proportional increase in our revenues orprofits.  We cannot be certain that the costs we incur investing in new businesses and technologies will result in aproportional increase in revenues or profits. In addition, the timely commercialization of products that we are developing may be disrupted or delayed by manufacturing or other technical difficulties, market  16 Table of Contentsacceptance or insufficient market size to support a new product, competitors new products, and difficulties in moving from the experimental stage to the production stage. These disruptionsor delays could affect our future business results.  Any failure to realize benefits from joint ventures, acquisitions or alliances couldadversely affect future financial results.  As part of our strategies for growth and improved profitability, we have madeand may continue to make acquisitions and investments and enter into joint ventures. The success of acquisitions of new technologies, companies and products, or arrangements with third parties is not always predictable and we may not be successfulin realizing our objectives as anticipated.  Negative or uncertain worldwide economic conditions may adversely impact our business. Our operations and performance are materially affected by worldwide economic conditions. In periods with significantmarket turmoil and tightened credit availability, we may experience difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, pricing pressure on products and services and reduced global business activity. A global economic downturn may reduce demand for ourproducts, which would decrease our revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows.  We may berequired to impair or write off certain assets if our assumptions about future sales and profitability prove incorrect.  Inanalyzing the value of our inventory, property, plant and equipment, investments and intangible assets, we have made assumptions about future sales (pricing and volume), costs and cash generation. These assumptions are based on managementsbest estimates and if the actual results differ significantly from these assumptions, we may not be able to realize the value of the assets recorded as of September 30, 2010, which could lead to an impairment or write-off of certain of theseassets in the future.  Our tax rate is dependent both upon the jurisdiction where our earnings arise and the tax laws in thosejurisdictions.  Our future tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the enactment of taxlegislation currently proposed in the U.S.; other changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws; changes in the estimated realization of our net deferred tax assets; the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned andtaxed; the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. income and non-U.S. withholding taxes; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses that are notdeductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process research and development and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions; changes in available tax credits; changes in share-based compensation expense and theresolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities. Losses for which no tax benefits can be recorded could materially impact our tax rate and its volatility from one quarter to another. Any significant change in ourjurisdictional earnings mix or in the tax laws in those jurisdictions could increase our future tax rates and reduce net income in those periods.  Regulations requiring a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions will likely impact the carbon black industry, including our carbon black operations. Carbon dioxide is emitted in the carbon black manufacturing process. In December 2005, the European Commission (EC) publisheda new directive that includes carbon black manufacturing in the combustion sector and in Phase II of the Emissions Trading Scheme for the period 2008 to 2012. The EC is developing allowable emission credits for Phase III of the Emissions TradingScheme, which will apply for the period 2013 to 2020. Various European Union member states have included carbon black facilities in their national   17 Table of Contentsallocation plans and we have taken actions to comply with applicableCO2 emission requirements. However, there can be no assurancethat we will be able to purchase emissions credits if our carbon black operations generate more CO2 than our allocations permit or that the cost of such credits will be acceptable to us. There are also ongoing discussions in other regions and countries, including the U.S., Canada, China and Brazil,regarding greenhouse gas emission reduction programs, but those programs have not yet been defined and their potential impact on our manufacturing operations or financial results cannot be estimated at this time. Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results. As more fully described in Item 3Legal Proceedings, we are a party to or the subject of lawsuits, claims, andproceedings, including those involving contract, environmental, and health and safety matters as well as product liability and personal injury claims relating to asbestosis, silicosis, coal workers pneumoconiosis and berylliosis, and exposureto various chemicals. We are also a potentially responsible party in various environmental proceedings and remediation matters wherein substantial amounts are at issue. Adverse rulings, judgments or settlements in pending or future litigation(including contract litigation and liabilities associated with respirator claims) or in connection with environmental remediation activities could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in any forward-lookingstatements.  On occasion we enter into derivative contracts with financial counterparties. The effectiveness of these contracts isdependent on the ability of these financial counterparties to perform their obligations and their nonperformance could harm our financial condition.  We have entered into interest rate swap contracts, foreign currency derivatives and forward commodity contracts as part of our financial strategy. The effectiveness of our hedging programs using theseinstruments is dependent, in part, upon the counterparties to these contracts honoring their financial obligations. If any of our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations in the future, we could be exposed to increased earnings andcash flow volatility due to an instruments failure to hedge a financial risk.  We may be subject to information technology systemsfailures, network disruptions and breaches of data security.  Information technology systems failures, including risksassociated with upgrading our systems, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions, our ability to protect customer or company information and our financial reporting. Ourcomputer systems, including our back-up systems, could be damaged or interrupted by power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, events such as fires, earthquakes, floods,tornadoes and hurricanes, and/or errors by our employees. Although we have taken steps to address these concerns by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control measures, there can be no assurance that a system failure or datasecurity breach will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  The continued protection ofour patents and other proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success.  Our patent and otherintellectual property rights are important to our success and competitive position. We own various patents and other intellectual property rights in the U.S. and other countries covering many of our products, as well as processes and product uses.In addition, we are a licensee of various patents and intellectual property rights belonging to others in the U.S. and other countries. Because the laws and enforcement mechanisms of some countries may not allow us to protect our proprietary rightsto the same extent as we are able to in the U.S., the strength of our intellectual property rights will vary from country to country.   18 Table of ContentsIrrespective of our proprietary intellectual property rights, we may be subject to claimsthat our products, processes or product uses infringe the intellectual property rights of others. These claims, even if they are without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend and if we were to lose such claims, we could be subjectto injunctions and/or damages, or be required to enter into licensing agreements requiring royalty payments and/or use restrictions. Licensing agreements may not be available to us, and if available, may not be available on acceptable terms. Natural disasters could affect our operations and financial results. We operate facilities in areas of the world that are exposed to natural hazards, such as hurricanes and earthquakes. Such events coulddisrupt our supply of raw materials or otherwise affect production, transportation and delivery of our products or affect demand for our products.   "
17,CBT,CABOT CORP,2009-11-30,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
  In addition to factors described elsewhere in this report, the following are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. It is not possible, however, topredict or identify all such factors. Accordingly, investors should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.  Negative or uncertain worldwide economic conditions may adversely impact our business.  Our operations and performance are materially affected by worldwide economic conditions, which deteriorated significantly during fiscal 2009. Market turmoil and tightened credit availability generallyreduced consumer confidence, increased difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, increased pricing pressure on products and services, and led to widespread reduction of global business activity. Uncertainty about current global economicconditions has resulted in decreased consumer spending and a significant decline in sales in the automotive, electronics and construction industries worldwide. As a result, we have experienced declines in global demand for our products that servethese industries, with volumes in our Core and Performance Segments for fiscal 2009 more than 20% below the levels that we experienced in fiscal 2008. These developments have resulted in decreased revenues and weaker results of operations. While wehave seen signs of recovery and increased demand in most of our businesses, continued weakness in worldwide economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows.  Changes in supply-demand balance in the regions and the industries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial results.  Our key customers continue to shift their manufacturing capacity from mature markets such as North America and Western Europe to emergingregions such as Asia, South America and Eastern Europe. Although we are responding to meet these market demand conditions, we cannot be certain that we will be successful expanding capacity in emerging regions (which depends in part on economic andpolitical conditions in these regions and, in some cases, on our ability to acquire or form strategic business alliances) or in reducing capacity in mature regions commensurate with industry demand. Similarly, demand for our customers productsand our competitors reactions to market conditions could affect our financial results.  In addition, our Rubber Blacksand Supermetals Businesses are sensitive to changes in industry capacity utilization. As a result, pricing tends to decrease when capacity utilization in these businesses decreases, which could affect our financial performance.  Our restructuring activities and cost saving initiatives may not achieve the results we anticipate.  We have undertaken and will continue to undertake cost reduction initiatives and organizational restructurings to optimize our asset base,improve operating efficiencies and generate cost savings. In connection with many of these actions we have projected significant one-time and on-going cost savings. The success of these activities is not predictable and we cannot be certain that wewill be able to complete these initiatives as planned or that the estimated operating efficiencies or cost savings from such activities will be fully realized or maintained over time. In addition, where we have closed manufacturing facilities, wemay not be successful in migrating our customers from those closed facilities to our other facilities.  Volatility in the price of rawmaterials or their reduced availability could decrease our margins.  Our manufacturing processes consume significantamounts of energy and raw materials, the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond our control. Dramatic increases in such costs or decreases in the availability of raw materials at acceptable costscould have an adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, movements in the market price for crude oil typically affect carbon black feedstock costs. Significant movements in the market price for crude oil tend to create volatility inour carbon black feedstock costs, which can effect our working capital and results of  14 Table of Contentsoperations. Although our long-term and some of our annual carbon black supply contracts provide for a price adjustment to account for changes in feedstock costs, there is a lag between the timewhen we incur feedstock costs and the time when prices are adjusted under some of these contracts. Accordingly, we may not be able to pass increased costs along to our customers when they occur, which can have a significant negative impact onresults of operations and cash flows in a given quarter. We have reduced the time lag in many of our long-term contracts as they have come up for renewal, but we may not be successful in reducing the time lag in some or all of the remainder of thesecontracts as they come up for renewal in the future. In addition, it is possible that a supply contract with a price adjustment mechanism could expire by its terms before we are able to recapture fully our raw material cost increases. We attempt tooffset the effects of increases in raw material costs through selling price increases in our non-contract sales, productivity improvements and cost reduction efforts. Success in offsetting increased raw material costs with price increases is largelyinfluenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased raw material and energy costs ormay decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales. If we are not able to fully offset the effects of increased raw material or energy costs, it could have a significant impact on our financial results.  We depend on a group of key customers for a significant portion of our sales. A significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in acustomers performance or financial position could harm our business and financial condition.  Our success instrengthening relationships and growing business with our largest customers and retaining their business over extended time periods could affect our future results. We have a total of nine customers in the tire, silicones, capacitor materials andmicroelectronics industries that together represent a significant portion of our total net sales and operating revenues. In fiscal 2009, sales to The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company by our Rubber Blacks Business accounted for approximately 10% ofour consolidated revenues. The loss of any of our important customers, or a reduction in volumes sold to them because of a work stoppage or other disruption, could adversely affect our results of operations until such business is replaced or thedisruption ends. Any deterioration of the financial condition of any of our customers or the industries they serve that impairs our customers ability to make payments to us also could increase our uncollectible receivables and could affect ourfuture results and financial condition.  Our operations involve the handling of hazardous and, in some instances, radioactive materials,and we are subject to extensive safety, health and environmental requirements, which could increase our costs and/or reduce our revenues.  Our ongoing operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety, health and environmental matters (SH&ERequirements), many of which provide for substantial monetary fines and criminal sanctions for violations. These SH&E Requirements include requirements to obtain and comply with various environmental-related permits for constructing anynew facilities and operating all of our existing facilities. In June 2009, we received an information request from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as part of an EPA national initiative focused on the U.S. carbonblack manufacturing sector. The information request relates to our Pampa, Texas facilitys compliance with certain regulatory and permitting requirements under the Clean Air Act, including the New Source Review (NSR) constructionpermitting requirements. We responded to EPAs information request in August 2009 and are awaiting a response from EPA. As a result of this initiative, based upon how EPA has handled similar NSR initiatives with other industrial sectors, it ispossible that EPA could attempt to compel us to employ additional technology control devices or approaches with respect to emissions at certain facilities and/or seek a civil penalty from us.  In addition, the operation of a chemical manufacturing business as well as the sale and distribution of chemical products involve safety,health and environmental risks. For example, the production and/or processing of carbon black, fumed metal oxides, tantalum, niobium, aerogel and other chemicals involve the handling, transportation, manufacture or use of certain substances orcomponents that may be considered  15 Table of Contentstoxic or hazardous within the meaning of applicable SH&E Requirements. The processing of tantalum ore also involves radioactive substances. The transportation of chemical products and otheractivities associated with the manufacturing process have the potential to cause environmental or other damage as well as injury or death to employees or third parties.  We could incur significant expenditures in connection with such operational risks. We believe that our ongoing operations comply with current SH&E Requirements in a manner that should not materiallyaffect our earnings or cash flow in an adverse manner. We cannot be certain, however, that significant costs or liabilities will not be incurred with respect to SH&E Requirements and our operations. Moreover, we are not able to predict whetherfuture changes or developments in SH&E Requirements will affect our earnings or cash flow in a materially adverse manner.  Fluctuationsin foreign currency exchange and interest rates could affect our financial results.  We earn revenues, pay expenses, ownassets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In fiscal 2009, we derived a majority of our revenues from sales outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S.dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollaragainst other currencies in countries where we operate will affect our results of operations and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Because of the geographic diversity of our operations, weaknesses in some currenciesmight be offset by strengths in others over time. In addition, we are exposed to adverse changes in interest rates. We manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivativeinstruments as well as foreign currency debt. We cannot be certain, however, that we will be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.  We rely on our committed lines of credit to provide us with working capital.  At September 30, 2009, we had $460 million in committed lines of credit, including $400 million under a revolving credit facility thatmatures in August 2010. We plan to replace our revolving credit facility. A replacement facility may be for a lesser amount and a shorter term, and at borrowing costs that are higher than those under our current revolving credit facility. Inaddition, a new facility may contain more restrictive terms and covenants than our current facility.  We have entered into a number ofderivative contracts with financial counterparties. The effectiveness of these contracts is dependent on the ability of these financial counterparties to perform their obligations and their nonperformance could harm our financial condition.  We have entered into interest rate swap contracts, foreign currency derivatives and forward commodity contracts as part of ourfinancial strategy. The effectiveness of our hedging programs using these instruments is dependent, in part, upon the counterparties to these contracts honoring their financial obligations. While we have not experienced any losses due tocounterparty nonperformance, if any of our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations in the future, we could be exposed to increased earnings and cash flow volatility due to an instruments failure to hedge a financial risk. We are exposed to political or country risk inherent in doing business in some countries.  Sales outside of the United States constituted a majority of our revenues in fiscal 2009. Our operations in some countries may be subject tothe following risks: changes in the rate of economic growth; unsettled political or economic conditions; possible expropriation or other governmental actions; social unrest, war, terrorist activities or other armed conflict; confiscatory taxation orother adverse tax policies; deprivation of contract rights; trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products; reduced  16 Table of Contentsprotection of intellectual property rights; restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital; exchange controls; inflation; currency fluctuations and devaluation; the effect of globalhealth, safety and environmental matters on economic conditions and market opportunities; and changes in financial policy and availability of credit.  Plant capacity expansions may be delayed and not achieve the expected benefits.  Our ability to completecapacity expansions as planned may be delayed or interrupted by the need to obtain environmental and other regulatory approvals, availability of labor and materials, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, and other risks customarilyassociated with construction projects. Moreover, capacity expansion in our Rubber Blacks, Performance Products and Fumed Metal Oxides Businesses could have a negative impact on the financial performance of these businesses until capacity utilizationis sufficient to absorb the incremental costs associated with the expansion.  The money we spend developing new businesses may not resultin a proportional increase in our revenues or profits.  We cannot be certain that the costs we incur investing in newbusinesses will result in a proportional increase in revenues or profits. In addition, the timely commercialization of products that we are developing may be disrupted or delayed by manufacturing or other technical difficulties, market acceptance orinsufficient market size to support a new product, competitors new products, and difficulties in moving from the experimental stage to the production stage. These disruptions or delays could affect our future results.  Any failure to realize benefits from joint ventures, acquisitions or alliances could adversely affect future financial results.  As part of our strategies for growth and improved profitability, we have made and may continue to make acquisitions and investments and enterinto joint ventures. The success of acquisitions of new technologies, companies and products, or arrangements with third parties is not predictable and we may not be successful in realizing our objectives as anticipated.  We may be required to impair or write off certain assets if our assumptions about future sales and profitability prove incorrect.  In our analysis of the recoverability of certain assets, namely inventory, property, plant and equipment, investments, intangible assets anddeferred tax assets, we have made assumptions about future sales (pricing, volume and region of sale), costs, cash generation and the ultimate profitability of the business and/or tax jurisdiction. These assumptions were based on managementsbest estimates and if the actual results differ significantly from these assumptions, we may not be able to realize the value of the assets recorded as of September 30, 2009, which could lead to an impairment or write-off of certain of theseassets in the future.  Increases in our tax rate may reduce our net income.  Our future tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors including the enactment of the currently proposed U.S. tax legislation;other changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws; changes in the estimated realization of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; the repatriation of non-U.S.earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses that are not always deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquiredin-process research and development and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions; changes in available tax credits; changes in share-based compensation expense and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various taxauthorities. Losses for which no tax benefits can be recorded could materially impact our tax rate and its volatility from one quarter to another. Any significant increase in our future tax rates could reduce net income in those periods.  17 Table of ContentsRegulations requiring a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions will impact the carbon black industry,including us.

  In addition tofactors described elsewhere in this report, the following are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. It is not possible, however, to predict or identify allsuch factors. Accordingly, investors should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.  Thevolatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets and further adverse changes in the global economy may negatively impact our business.  Our operations and performance are materially affected by worldwide economic conditions, which have deteriorated significantly and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. The recent market turmoil andtightening of credit has generally reduced consumer confidence, increased difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, increased pricing pressure on products and services, and led to volatile energy prices and widespread reduction of globalbusiness activity. Uncertainty about current global economic conditions has resulted in decreased consumer spending and a significant decline in sales in the automotive, electronics and construction industries worldwide. As a result, we haveexperienced declines in global demand for our products that serve these industries, as well as a slowdown in growth in emerging markets where we have recently added, or have plans to increase, manufacturing capacity. These developments are likely toresult in decreased revenues and weaker results of operations and, if they persist, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows.

Any deterioration of the financial condition of any of our customers or the industries they serve that impairs ourcustomers ability to make payments to us also could increase our uncollectible receivables and could affect our future results and financial condition.  We rely on our committed lines of credit to provide us with working capital. Any threat to the viability of the banks participating in these credit facilities could reduce the credit available to us.  At September 30, 2008, we had $427 million in committed lines of credit under which we had outstanding borrowings of $274 million. Of this, $259 millionis borrowed under our revolving credit facility, which matures in August 2010. The current financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets has increased the possibility that financial institutions may consolidate or go outof business. While we believe that at this time all of the banks participating in our committed lines of credit are viable and are ready to stand by their commitments, if recent levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen, evencommitted lines of credit may not be available when needed. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to replace our revolving credit facility with a new facility, at all or with the same borrowing capacity, and on other termsacceptable to us.   15 Table of ContentsWe have entered into a number of derivative contracts with financial counterparties. The effectiveness of thesecontracts is dependent on the continued viability of these financial counterparties and their nonperformance could harm our financial condition.  We have entered into interest rate swap contracts, foreign currency derivatives, net investment hedges and forward commodity contracts as part of our financial strategy. The effectiveness of our hedging programs using these instruments isdependent, in part, upon the counterparties to these contracts honoring their financial obligations. The recent upheaval in the capital markets has caused the viability of certain counterparties to be questioned. While we have not experienced anylosses due to counterparty nonperformance, if any of our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations in the future, we could be exposed to increased earnings and cash flow volatility due to an instruments failure to hedge afinancial risk.  Our efforts to maintain or increase our margins may not be successful.  We have undertaken and will continue to undertake cost reduction initiatives and organizational restructurings to improve operating efficiencies andgenerate cost savings. We cannot be certain that we will be able to complete these initiatives as planned or that the estimated operating efficiencies or cost savings from such activities will be realized.  In addition to cost reduction initiatives, we try to maintain or improve margins on our non-contracted sales, and on our contracted sales as permittedunder the terms of the relevant agreement, through price increases. However, such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased raw material and energy costs, or may decrease demand for ourproducts and our volume of sales.  Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates could affect our financial results.  We earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar.

Our operations involve the handling of hazardous and, insome instances, radioactive materials, and we are subject to extensive safety, health and environmental requirements, which could increase our costs and/or reduce our revenues.  Our ongoing operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety, healthand environmental matters (SH&E Requirements), many of which provide for substantial monetary fines and criminal sanctions for violations. These SH&E Requirements include requirements to obtain and comply with variousenvironmental-related permits for constructing any new facilities and operating all of our existing facilities. In addition, the operation of a chemical manufacturing business as well as the sale and distribution of chemical products involve safety,health and environmental risks. For example, the production and/or processing of carbon black, fumed metal oxides, tantalum, niobium, aerogel and other chemicals involve the handling, transportation, manufacture or use of certain substances orcomponents that may be considered toxic or hazardous within the meaning of applicable SH&E Requirements. The processing of tantalum ore also involves radioactive substances. The transportation of chemical products and other activities associatedwith the manufacturing process have the potential to cause environmental or other damage as well as injury or death to employees or third parties.   17 Table of ContentsWe could incur significant expenditures in connection with such operational risks. We believe that ourongoing operations comply with current SH&E Requirements in a manner that should not materially affect our earnings or cash flow in an adverse manner. We cannot be certain, however, that significant costs or liabilities will not be incurred withrespect to SH&E Requirements and our operations. Moreover, we are not able to predict whether future changes or developments in SH&E Requirements will affect our earnings or cash flow in a materially adverse manner.  Regulations requiring a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions will impact the carbon black industry, including us.  Carbon dioxide is emitted in the carbon black manufacturing process. In December 2005, the European Commission published a new directive that includescarbon black manufacturing in the combustion sector and in Phase II of the Emissions Trading Scheme for the period 2008 to 2012. Various European Union member states have included carbon black facilities in their national allocation plans and wehave taken actions to comply with applicable carbon dioxide emission requirements. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to purchase emissions credits if our carbon black operations generate more carbon dioxide than our allocationspermit or that the cost of such credits will be acceptable to us. There are also ongoing discussions in other regions and countries, including the United States and Canada, regarding greenhouse gas emission control and reduction programs, but thoseprograms have not yet been defined and their potential impact on our manufacturing operations or financial results cannot be estimated at this time.  Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results.  As more fully described in Item 3Legal Proceedings, we are a party to or the subject of lawsuits, claims, and proceedings, including those involving contract, environmental, antitrust, and health and safety matters as wellas product liability and personal injury claims relating to asbestosis, silicosis, coal workers pneumoconiosis and berylliosis, and exposure to various chemicals. Adverse rulings, judgments or settlements in pending or future litigation(including contract litigation and liabilities associated with respirator claims and our former beryllium operations) could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in any forward-looking statements.  The continued protection of our patents and other proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success.  Our patent and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and competitive position. We own various patents and other intellectualproperty rights in the United States and other countries covering many of our products, as well as processes and product uses. In addition, we are a licensee of various patents and intellectual property rights belonging to others in the UnitedStates and other countries. Because the laws and enforcement mechanisms of some countries may not allow us to protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as we are able to in the United States, the strength of our intellectual property rightswill vary from country to country.  Irrespective of our proprietary intellectual property rights, we may be subject to claims that ourproducts, processes or product uses infringe the intellectual property rights of others. These claims, even if they are without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend and if we were to lose such claims, we could be subject toinjunctions and/or damages, or be required to enter into licensing agreements requiring royalty payments and/or use restrictions. Licensing agreements may not be available to us, and if available, may not be available on acceptable terms.  18 Table of ContentsWe may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security.  Information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by impeding ourprocessing of transactions, resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or company information and impeding our financial reporting. Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, could be damaged or interrupted by power outages,computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes, and/or errors by our employees. Although we have taken steps to addressthese concerns by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control measures, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results ofoperations.  Increases in our tax rate may reduce our net income.  Our future tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors including the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have notpreviously provided for U.S. taxes; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses that are not always deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process research and developmentand impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions; changes in available tax credits; changes in share-based compensation expense; changes in the estimated realization of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; changes in tax laws or theinterpretation of such tax laws; and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities. Any significant increase in our future tax rates could reduce net income in those periods.  Natural disasters could affect our operations and financial results.  We operate facilities in areas of the world that are exposed to natural hazards, such as hurricanes and earthquakes. Such events could disrupt our supply of raw materials or otherwise affect production, transportationand delivery of our products or affect demand for our products.   19 Table of Contents"
13,CBT,CABOT CORP,2007-11-29,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
  In addition tofactors described elsewhere in this report, the following are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. It is not possible, however, to predict or identify allsuch factors. Accordingly, investors should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.  Changes insupply-demand balance in the regions and the industries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial results.  Our keycustomers in mature carbon black markets such as North America and Western Europe continue to shift their manufacturing capacity from those regions to emerging regions such as Asia, South America and Eastern Europe. Although we are responding tomeet these market demand conditions, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in expanding capacity in emerging regions (which depends in part on economic and political conditions in these regions and, in some cases, on our ability to acquireor form strategic business alliances) or in reducing capacity in mature regions commensurate with industry demand. Similarly, demand for our customers products and our competitors reactions to market conditions could affect our results. In addition, our rubber blacks, performance products and fumed metal oxides product lines are sensitive to changes in industry capacityutilization. As a result, pricing tends to decrease when capacity utilization in these product lines decreases, which could affect our financial performance.  Increases in the price of raw materials or their reduced availability could increase our cost of goods and decrease our profitability.  Our manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of energy and raw materials, the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond our control. Dramatic increases insuch costs or decreases in the availability of raw materials at acceptable costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, movements in the market price for crude oil   14 Table of Contentstypically affect carbon black feedstock costs. Accordingly, fluctuations in crude oil prices tend to create volatility in our carbon black feedstock costs,and potentially our working capital and results of operations. Although our long-term and some of our annual carbon black supply contracts provide for a price adjustment to account for changes in feedstock costs, there is a lag between the time whenfeedstock costs are incurred by us and the time when prices are adjusted under the contracts. Accordingly, we may not be able to pass increased costs along to our customers during the quarter in which they occur, which can have a significantnegative impact on results of operations and cash flows in a given quarter. In addition, it is possible that a supply contract with a price adjustment mechanism could expire by its terms before we are able to recapture fully our raw material costincreases. We have taken actions to offset the effects of higher raw material costs through selling price increases in our non-contract sales, productivity improvements and cost reduction efforts. Success in offsetting higher raw material costs withprice increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the market served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased rawmaterial and energy costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales. If we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs, it could have a significant impact on our financial results. In addition, the proposed environmental regulations applicable to the European carbon black industry that call for a reduction in theannual average sulfur content in carbon black feedstock may be adopted by EU member countries in such a manner that we may experience some difficulty obtaining low sulfur feedstock at an acceptable cost for our European operations.  We depend on a group of key customers for a significant portion of our sales. A significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customersperformance or financial position could harm our business and financial condition.  Our success in strengthening relationships andgrowing business with our largest customers and retaining their business over extended time periods could affect our future results. Three major tire customers, one silicones customer, four capacitor materials customers and one microelectronicscustomer represent a material portion of our total net sales and operating revenues. In fiscal year 2007, sales to The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company by our rubber blacks product line accounted for approximately 12% of our consolidated revenues.The loss of any one or more of our important customers, or a reduction in volumes sold to them because of a work stoppage or other disruption, could materially adversely affect our results of operations until such business is replaced or thedisruption ends. Any deterioration of the financial condition of any of our customers that impairs their ability to make payments to us also could affect our future results and financial condition.  Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates could affect our financial results.  We earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In fiscal year 2007, we used 17functional currencies in addition to the U.S. dollar and derived a substantial amount of our revenues from sales outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues,income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies willaffect our results of operations and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Because of the geographic diversity of our operations, weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time. Inaddition, we are exposed to adverse changes in interest rates. We manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments as well as foreign currencydebt. We cannot be certain, however, that our financial risk management program will be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.   15 Table of ContentsWe are exposed to political or country risk inherent in doing business in some countries.  Sales outside of the United States constituted a substantial amount of our revenues in fiscal year 2007. Our operations in some countries may be subjectto the following risks: unsettled political or economic conditions; possible expropriation or other governmental actions; social unrest, war or other armed conflict; confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; deprivation of contractrights; trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital; exchange controls; inflation; currency fluctuations anddevaluation; and changes in financial policy and availability of credit.  Plant capacity expansions may be delayed and not achieve the expectedbenefits.  Our ability to complete capacity expansions as planned may be delayed or interrupted by the need to obtain environmental andother regulatory approvals, availability of labor and materials, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. Moreover, capacity expansion in our rubber blacks, performanceproducts, fumed metal oxides and inkjet colorants product lines could have a negative impact on the business performance of these product lines until capacity utilization is sufficient to absorb the incremental costs associated with the expansion. Our efforts to maintain or increase our margins may not be successful.  We have undertaken and will continue to undertake cost reduction initiatives and organizational restructurings to improve operating efficiencies andgenerate cost savings. We cannot be certain that we will be able to complete these initiatives as planned or that the estimated operating efficiencies or cost savings from such activities will be realized.  In addition to cost reduction initiatives, we try to maintain or improve margins on our non-contracted sales through price increases. However, suchincreases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased raw material and energy costs, or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales.  The money we spend developing new businesses may not result in a proportional increase in our revenues or profits.  Our strategic focus includes optimizing our core businesses and investing the cash and intellectual resources they generate in developing new businesses.We cannot be certain that the costs we incur investing in these new businesses will result in a proportional increase in revenues or profits. In addition, the timely commercialization of products that we are developing may be disrupted or delayed bymanufacturing or other technical difficulties, market acceptance or insufficient market size to support a new product, competitors new products, and difficulties in moving from the experimental stage to the production stage. These delays couldaffect our future results.  Any failure to realize benefits from joint ventures, acquisitions or alliances could adversely affect future financialresults.  As part of our strategies for growth and improved profitability, we have made and may continue to make acquisitions andinvestments and enter into joint ventures. The success of acquisitions of new technologies, companies and products, or arrangements with third parties is not predictable and we may not be successful in realizing our objectives as anticipated.  16 Table of ContentsWe may be required to impair or write-off certain assets if our assumptions about future sales and profitability proveincorrect.  In our analysis of the recoverability of certain assets, namely inventory, property, plant and equipment, investments,intangible assets and deferred tax assets, we have made assumptions about future sales (pricing, volume and region of sale), costs, cash generation and the ultimate profitability of the business and/or tax jurisdiction. These assumptions were basedon managements best estimates and if the actual results differ significantly from these assumptions, we may not be able to realize the value of the assets recorded as of September 30, 2007, which could lead to an impairment or write-offof certain of these assets in the future.  Our operations involve the handling of hazardous materials, and we are subject to extensive safety, healthand environmental requirements, which could increase our costs and/or reduce our revenues.

We believe that our ongoing operations comply with current SH&ERequirements in a manner that should not materially affect our earnings or cash flow in an adverse manner. We cannot be certain, however, that significant costs or liabilities will not be incurred with respect to SH&E Requirements and ouroperations. Moreover, we are not able to predict whether future changes or developments in SH&E Requirements will affect our earnings or cash flow in a materially adverse manner.  Global interest in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions will likely have some impact on the carbon black industry, including us.  Carbon dioxide is inherently emitted as part of the carbon black manufacturing process. In December 2005, the European Commission published a newdirective that includes carbon black manufacturing in the combustion sector and includes carbon black manufacturing in Phase II of the Emissions Trading Scheme for the period 2008 to 2012. Various European Union member states have included carbonblack facilities in their draft national allocation plans. There are also ongoing discussions in other regions and countries, including the United States, regarding greenhouse gas emission control and reduction programs, but those programs have notyet been defined and their potential impact on Cabots manufacturing operations or financial results cannot be estimated at this time.

In addition to factorsdescribed elsewhere in this report, the following are important factors thatcould cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in ourforward-looking statements. It is not possible, however, to predict or identifyall such factors. Accordingly, investors should not consider the following tobe a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.Changes in supply-demand balance at our plants and theindustries in which we operate may adversely affect our financialresults.Our key customers in mature carbon black markets suchas North America and Western Europe continue to shift their manufacturing capacityfrom those regions to developing regions such as Asia, South America andEastern Europe.

Any deterioration of the 13 financial condition of anyof our customers that impairs their ability to make payments to us also couldaffect our future results and financial condition.In addition, a materialportion of our sales are made to customers under long-term and annualcontracts. The loss or expiration of any of these customer contracts couldincrease the volatility of our business results.Increases in the price of raw materials or theirreduced availability could increase our cost of goods and decrease ourprofitability.The cost, availability andquality of raw materials affect our results. Dramatic increases in such costsor decreases in the availability of raw materials at acceptable costs couldhave an adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, if proposedenvironmental regulations applicable to the European carbon black industry thatcall for a reduction in the annual average sulfur content in carbon blackfeedstock are adopted, we may experience some difficulty obtaining low sulfurfeedstock at an acceptable cost for our European operations. Moreover, althoughour long-term and some of our annual carbon black supply contracts provide fora price adjustment to account for changes in feedstock costs, there is a lagbetween the time when feedstock costs are incurred by us and the time when pricesare adjusted under the contracts. Accordingly, we may not be able to passincreased costs along to our customers during the quarter in which they occur,which can have a significant negative impact in a given quarter. Fornon-contract sales, we may not be able to increase prices at all or in anamount sufficient to compensate for higher feedstock costs. In addition, it ispossible that a supply contract with a price adjustment mechanism could expireby its terms before we are able to recapture fully our raw material costincreases.Fluctuations inforeign currency exchange and interest rates could affect our financialresults.We earn revenues, payexpenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies otherthan the U.S. dollar.

Because of the geographic diversity of ouroperations, weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths inothers over time. In addition, we are exposed to adverse changes in interestrates. We manage these risks through normal operating and financing activitiesand, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financialinstruments as well as foreign currency debt. We cannot be certain, however,that our financial risk management program will be successful in reducing therisks inherent in exposures to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.We are exposed topolitical or country risk inherent in doing business in some countries.These risks may include nationalizationand expropriation of assets or other actions of governments, importing andexporting issues, contract loss and asset abandonment.Plant capacity expansionsmay be delayed and not achieve the expected benefits.Our ability to completecapacity expansions as planned may be delayed or interrupted by the need toobtain environmental and other regulatory approvals, availability of labor andmaterials, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, and other riskscustomarily associated with construction projects.
