 Related to Arcadia ProductsNorth American and global economic and industry-related business conditions materially affect our sales and results of operations.Our Arcadia Products business is significantly influenced by North American economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the North American commercial and residential construction industry. The construction industry is impacted by macroeconomic trends, such as availability of credit, employment levels, consumer confidence, interest rates and commodity prices. Recent rising inflation, interest rates, and construction costs have reduced, and could continue to reduce, the demand for our products and impact our profitability. Higher interest rates make it more expensive to finance construction projects, and as a result, may reduce the demand for our products. In addition, changes in architectural design trends, demographic trends, and/or remote work trends could negatively impact demand for our products. To the extent changes in these factors negatively impact the overall commercial construction industry, our revenue and profits could be significantly reduced. We may not be able to continue to compete successfully against other companies in our industry.The markets in which Arcadia Products operates are highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and better capitalized than we are. These competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within the industries and markets in which we operate and may have significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we have. Moreover, barriers to entry are low in certain product lines and new competitors may enter our industry, whether within the U.S. or internationally. An increase in competition, including in the form of aggressive pricing by new market entrants or offerings of alternative building materials, could cause us to lose customers and lead to decreases in net sales and profitability if we are not able to respond adequately to such challenges. The actions of our existing competitors or new competitors could result in loss of customers and/or market share. Changes in our competitors' products, prices or services could negatively impact our market share, net sales and/or margins.If we are unable to manage our supply chain effectively, including availability and price of materials used in our products, our results of operations will be negatively affected.We obtain a significant portion of our key raw materials, such as aluminum extrusions, from a few key suppliers. While we structure many of our supply arrangements to moderate the effects of fluctuations in the market for raw aluminum and we endeavor to adjust our customer pricing to offset potential impacts, operating results could be negatively impacted by price movements in the market for raw aluminum. In recent years, we have seen increased volatility in the price of aluminum that we purchase from our key suppliers. 17Table of ContentsOur suppliers are subject to fluctuations in general economic cycles. Global economic conditions and political and economic instability may impact their ability to operate their businesses, including the ongoing military action between Russia and Ukraine and related government actions. Some of our suppliers have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by the costs or availability of raw materials, labor and transportation, and they may not be able to handle commodity cost volatility or changing volumes while still performing up to our specifications. These factors may cause suppliers to be unable to meet their commitments or to negatively change the terms of supply arrangements.The loss of, or substantial decrease in the availability of, products from our suppliers, or the loss of a key supplier, could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. If any of our key suppliers are unable to meet their commitments, or if those supply arrangements are terminated, we may not be able to obtain certain raw materials on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and may suffer a significant interruption in our ability to manufacture our products, including because it may be difficult to find substitute or alternate suppliers as the aluminum extrusions we use are customized. We could also be required to maintain higher inventory levels as we address supply uncertainties. Such developments would result in higher costs and potentially a decrease in our revenues and profitability. If our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our delivery times are extended, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. An inability to successfully develop new products or improve existing products could negatively impact our ability to attract new customers and/or retain existing customers.Our success depends on meeting consumer needs and anticipating changes in consumer preferences with successful new products and product improvements. We aim to introduce products and new product designs proactively to offset obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products. While we devote significant focus to the development of new products, we may not be successful in product development and our new products may not be commercially successful. In addition, it is possible that competitors may improve their products more rapidly or effectively, which could adversely affect our sales. Furthermore, market demand may decline as a result of consumer preferences trending away from our categories or trending down within our brands or product categories, which could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Product quality issues and product liability claims could adversely affect our operating results.We believe that future orders of our products will depend on our ability to maintain the performance, reliability, quality and timely delivery standards required by our customers. We have in the past been and currently are subject to product liability and warranty claims. If our products have performance, reliability or quality problems, or products are installed improperly, we may experience additional warranty expense; reduced or canceled orders; or delays in the collection of accounts receivable. Additionally, product liability and warranty claims could result in costly and time-consuming litigation that could require significant time and attention of management and involve significant monetary damages that could negatively impact our operating results. There is no assurance that the number and value of product liability and warranty claims will not increase as compared to historical claim rates, or that our warranty reserve at any particular time will be sufficient. No assurance can be given that coverage under insurance policies, if applicable, will be adequate to cover future product liability claims against us. If we are unable to recover on insurance claims, in whole or in part, or if we exhaust our available insurance coverage at some point in the future, then we might be forced to expend legal fees and settlement or judgment costs relating to product liability and warranty claims, which could negatively impact our profitability, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.We recently implemented a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, and challenges with the implementation of the system may adversely impact our business and operations.Phase one of a new ERP system went live in July 2023. While the ERP changeover led to a brief operational slowdown early in the third quarter, the system is expected to enhance operating efficiencies and the internal control environment throughout Arcadia by streamlining data sources, simplifying complex processes, and reducing manual processes. Any disruptions, deficiencies, or other problems associated with the implementation of our ERP system, such as quality issues, programming errors, or inconsistent employee adoption could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, produce timely and accurate financial statements, or comply with applicable regulations. This could result in negative impacts on our business and operations. Additionally, the implementation involves greater utilization of third-party cloud computing services in connection with our Arcadia operations. Problems faced by us or our third-party providers relating to this implementation, including technological or business-related disruptions and cybersecurity threats, could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition for future periods. Any failures identified within our internal controls as a result of this 18Table of Contentsimplementation, even if quickly remediated, or difficulties encountered during implementation, may adversely impact our operating results or hinder our ability to report our financial results in a timely and accurate basis.Risk Factors
 Related to DynaEnergeticsDemand for DynaEnergetics’ products is substantially dependent on the levels of capital expenditures by the oil and gas industry. Decreases or expected decreases in oil and gas prices and reduced expenditures in the oil and gas industry could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Demand for the majority of DynaEnergetics' products depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry’s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. Higher oil and gas prices have resulted in increasing North American completion activity and increased expenditures by the oil and gas industry. This has resulted in increased cash flows for E&P companies; however, E&P companies are still seeking to control their cost of operations and this has continued to contribute to downward pressure on prices for our products. In addition, the oil and gas industry has historically been cyclical, and to date in 2024, oil prices have declined significantly from their 2022 highs. When oil prices decline, we would expect an increased risk of reduced or delayed oil and gas exploration and production spending, project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us, all of which could result in reduced demand for our products, downward pressure on selling prices for our products and decreased revenues and profits. These effects would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and can be affected by a variety of factors, including:  •changes in the supply of and demand for hydrocarbons, which are affected by general economic, business and regulatory conditions;•the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and other oil producing companies to set and maintain production levels for oil;•oil and gas production levels in the U.S. and in other non-OPEC countries;•the level of excess production capacity;•speculation as to the future price of oil and the speculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts;•government initiatives to restrict oil and gas drilling or development or promote the use of renewable energy sources and public sentiment regarding the same;•political and economic uncertainty, geopolitical unrest, and acts of war;•the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and production activity;•access to potential resources;•changes in governmental policies, subsidies, or sanctions;•the costs of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;•technological advances affecting energy consumption; and•weather conditions.Continued or worsening conditions in the oil and gas industry generally may have a further material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.Failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customer demands could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing, internal fabrication utilization and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customer requirements. Factors that can impact our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements include the short-term nature of many customers’ commitments, our customers’ ability to reschedule, cancel and modify orders with little or no notice and without significant penalty, the accuracy of our customers’ forecasts, and seasonal or cyclical trends in customers' industries. To ensure availability of our products, particularly for our largest customers, we may start manufacturing our relevant products based on our customers’ forecasts, which are not binding. As a result, we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales that may never materialize or which may be substantially lower than expected. If actual demand for our products is lower than forecast, we may also experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and product 19Table of Contentsobsolescence. Because certain of our sales, research and development, and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income. Conversely, customers often require rapid increases in production on short notice. We may be unable to secure sufficient materials or contract manufacturing capacity to meet such increases in demand. This could damage our customer relationships, reduce revenue growth and margins, subject us to additional liabilities, harm our reputation, and prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities.Failure to manage periods of growth or contraction may seriously harm our business.Our industry frequently sees periods of expansion and contraction which require companies to adjust to customers’ needs and market demands. We regularly contend with these issues and must carefully manage our business to meet customer and market requirements. If we fail to manage these growth and contraction decisions effectively, we may find ourselves with either excess or insufficient resources and our business and our profitability could suffer as a result.Periods of contraction or reduced net sales, or other factors negatively affecting particular markets, require us to assess whether facilities remain viable, whether staffing levels need to be reduced, and how to respond to changing levels of customer demand. While maintaining excess capacity or higher levels of employment entails short-term costs, reductions in capacity or employment could impair our ability to respond to new opportunities and programs, market improvements or to maintain customer relationships. Our decisions to reduce costs and capacity can affect our short-term and long-term results and result in restructuring charges.Expansions, including the transfer of operations to other facilities, include the risk of additional costs and start-up inefficiencies. If we are unable to effectively manage our expansion projects or related anticipated net sales are not realized, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.We may not be able to continue to compete successfully against other companies in our industry.The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. DynaEnergetics competes with a broad spectrum of companies that produce and market perforating services and products. Many of these companies are large national and multi-national companies, including the oil and natural gas industry’s largest oilfield service providers. These companies have longer operating histories, greater financial, technical, and other resources, and greater name recognition than we do. In addition, we compete with many smaller companies capable of competing effectively on a regional or local basis. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. To remain competitive, DynaEnergetics must continue to provide innovative products at competitive prices and maintain an excellent reputation for value, quality, on-time delivery, and safety. If we fail to compete successfully against our competition, we may be unable to maintain acceptable sales levels, prices and margins for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operationsRecent conflict in the Middle East may adversely affect our business and results of operations.Recent conflict in the Middle East has resulted in volatility in oil prices due to concerns regarding the conflict’s impact on global oil supplies. Continued conflict or an expanded or increased level of conflict could further impact oil prices and drilling activity globally or have adverse effects on global macroeconomic conditions generally, which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.If we are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, and technology trends, our business and consolidated results of operations and the value of our intellectual property could be materially and adversely affected. The market for our products is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better and more reliable performance and enhanced product offerings. If we are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, and technology trends, our business and consolidated results of operations and the value of our intellectual property could be materially and adversely affected. Likewise, if our proprietary technologies, equipment, facilities, or work processes become obsolete, we may no longer be competitive, and our business and consolidated results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.We may be unable to successfully execute and realize the expected financial benefits from strategic initiatives.20Table of ContentsFrom time to time, our business has engaged in strategic initiatives, and such activities may occur in the future. These efforts have recently included a series of automation, lean manufacturing and cost-reduction initiatives designed to enhance profitability and improve quality. While we expect meaningful financial benefits from our strategic initiatives, we may not realize the full benefits expected within the anticipated timeframe. Adverse effects from strategy-driven organizational changes could interfere with our realization of anticipated synergies, customer service improvements and cost savings from these strategic initiatives. Additionally, our ability to fully realize the benefits and implement strategic initiatives may be limited by certain contractual commitments. Moreover, we may incur substantial expenses in connection with the execution of strategic plans in excess of what is forecasted. Further, strategic initiatives can be a complex and time-consuming process that can place substantial demands on management, which could divert attention from other business priorities or disrupt our daily operations. Any of these failures could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, which could constrain our liquidity.Demand for DynaEnergetics products could be reduced by existing and future legislation, regulations and public sentiment. Regulatory agencies and environmental advocacy groups in the United States, the E.U., and other regions or countries have been focusing considerable attention on emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their role in climate change. There is also increased focus, including by governments and our customers, investors and other stakeholders, on these and other sustainability and energy transition matters. Existing or future legislation and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, as well as initiatives by governments, non-governmental organizations, and companies to conserve energy or promote the use of alternative energy sources, and negative attitudes toward or perceptions of fossil fuel products and their relationship to the environment, may significantly curtail demand for and production of oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and thus reduce future demand for DynaEnergetics products. In addition, some international, national, state and local governments and agencies have also adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on directly limiting the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing. These laws and regulations could limit oil and gas development, lead to operational delays and increased costs for our customers, and therefore reduce demand for DynaEnergetics' products. Such reductions in demand for our products may, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Increased negative investor sentiment toward oil and gas and preference for assets outside of traditional energy sectors could lead to higher capital costs for our customers and reduced investment in fossil fuels, thereby reducing demand for our products. Such preferences could also impact our ability to obtain acceptable debt or equity financing on attractive terms or at all and could negatively impact our stock price over time. Our business, reputation and demand for our stock could be negatively affected if we do not (or are perceived to not) act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters.Consolidation of our customers and competitors may impact our results of operations.The oil and gas industry has historically experienced periods of consolidation which may result in reduced capital spending by some of our customers, the acquisition of one or more of our primary customers, or competitors and consolidated entities using size and purchasing power to seek pricing or other concessions, which may lead to decreased demand for our products. We are continuing to experience significant customer concentration and customer consolidation, resulting in certain customers having substantial pricing power, which has negatively impacted our margins and profitability.  During the year ended December 31, 2023, one DynaEnergetics customer accounted for approximately 15% of consolidated net sales of the Company. In addition, recent, ongoing and future mergers, combinations and consolidations in our industry could result in existing competitors increasing their market share. As a result, industry consolidation may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Risk Factors
 Related to NobelCladNobelClad’s business is dependent on sales to a limited number of customers in cyclical markets and our results are affected by the price of metals. NobelClad revenues are affected both by the demand for NobelClad’s explosion-welded cladding services and the base price of metal used in explosion-welded cladding operations. The explosion-welded cladding market is dependent upon sales of products for use by customers in a limited number of heavy industries, including oil and gas, chemicals and petrochemicals, alternative energy, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, rail car manufacturing, power generation, and industrial refrigeration. These industries tend to be cyclical in nature and an economic slowdown in one or all of these 21Table of Contentsindustries-whether due to traditional cyclicality, general economic conditions or other factors-could impact capital expenditures within that industry. Inflationary conditions in many markets, have created uncertainty in our end markets, and we have seen continued delays in projects and capital expenditures. In addition, metals prices affect the demand for cladded products and our margins. Although higher metal prices increase demand for use of cladded materials over solid metals, lead to higher sales (in terms of dollars rather than square meters of cladding) and generally higher margins for NobelClad, metal pricing is volatile. We have recently experienced several years of a low-metals-price environment, which significantly reduced demand for clad product and overall sales. In the last two years, the price of metals has increased substantially. However, there can be no assurance that prices will remain at these levels and supply chain difficulties and other uncertainties have disrupted projects and normal sales cycles. If demand or metals prices decline or if supply chain issues or similar disruptions persist, our sales would be adversely affected, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We are dependent on a relatively small number of large projects and customers for a significant portion of our net sales.A significant portion of our net sales is derived from a relatively small number of projects and customers; therefore, the failure to complete existing contracts on a timely basis, to receive payment for such services in a timely manner, or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect our ability to meet cash requirements exclusively through operating activities. We attempt to minimize the risk of losing customers or specific contracts by continually improving commercial execution and product quality, delivering product on time and competing aggressively on the basis of price. We expect to continue to depend upon our principal customers for a significant portion of our sales, although our principal customers may not continue to purchase products and services from us at current levels, if at all. The loss of one or more major customers or a change in their buying patterns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our backlog figures may not accurately predict future sales.We use backlog to predict our anticipated future sales. Our year-end backlog was $59.4 million, $55.5 million, and $41.2 million at the end of fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We define “backlog” at any given point in time to consist of all firm, unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time. We expect to fill most items in backlog within the following twelve months. However, since orders may be rescheduled or canceled and a significant portion of our net sales is derived from a small number of customers, backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels. Moreover, we cannot be sure of when during the future twelve-month period we will be able to recognize revenue corresponding to our backlog nor can we be certain that revenues corresponding to our backlog will not fall into periods beyond the twelve-month horizon. There is a limited availability of sites suitable for cladding operations.Our cladding process involves the detonation of large amounts of explosives. As a result, the sites where we perform cladding must meet certain criteria, including adequate distance from densely populated areas, specific geological characteristics, and the ability to comply with local noise and vibration abatement regulations in conducting the process. Our shooting sites in Pennsylvania and in Germany are located in mines. Our Pennsylvania shooting site is subleased under an arrangement pursuant to which we provide certain contractual services to the sub-landlord, and this sublease expires in 2029. Our shooting sites require ongoing maintenance and investment, and failure to adequately maintain these sites could result in reduced access or capacity constraints. In addition, we could experience difficulty in obtaining or renewing permits because of resistance from residents in the vicinity of existing or proposed sites. The failure to obtain required governmental approvals or permits could limit our ability to expand our cladding business in the future, and the failure to maintain such permits or satisfy other conditions to use the sites would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.There is no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully against other manufacturers of competitive products.Our explosion-welded clad products compete on a worldwide basis with explosion-welded clad products made by other manufacturers in the clad metal business and with products manufactured using other technologies. We see competition from large well-known clad suppliers and from a growing number of smaller companies with explosion welded clad manufacturing capability in China and India. Explosion-welded clad products also compete with products manufactured by roll bond and weld overlay cladding processes. The technical and commercial niches of each cladding process are well understood within the industry and vary from one market location to another and at different metal prices. We focus on reliability, product quality, on-time delivery performance, and low-cost manufacturing to minimize the potential of future competitive threats. However, there is no guarantee we will be able to maintain our competitive position.22Table of ContentsCustomers have the right to change orders until products are completed.Customers have some rights to change orders after they have been placed. If orders are changed, the extra expenses associated with the change usually will be passed on to the customer. However, because a change in an order may delay completion of the project, recognition of income for the project may also be delayed. Additionally, any errors or changes as to specifications or significant changes in pricing or availability of materials may cause cost overruns and delays in completion of projects. If we fail to meet delivery schedules, we may be required to pay damages or may risk loss of an order, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our costs could substantially increase if we experience a large claim or a significant number of warranty claims.Our product warranties against technical defects of our clad products vary depending on our purchase orders with customers. The warranties require us to repair or replace defective products and may require the payment of a certain percentage of the purchase price as liquidated damages for our failure to meet the specified product specifications and delivery requirements. In addition, our clad products are often used as part of larger projects or are used in potentially hazardous applications that can cause injury or loss of life and damage to property or equipment. In the event of an actual or alleged product defect, we may be named as a defendant in product liability or other lawsuits asserting potentially large claims. We cannot guarantee that insurance will be available or adequate to cover any or all liabilities incurred. We generally have not established any reserve funds for potential warranty claims since historically we have experienced few warranty claims for our products and the costs associated with our warranty claims have been low. If we experience an increase in warranty claims or if our repair and replacement costs associated with warranty claims increase significantly, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Risk Factors
 Related to our Businesses GenerallyOur efforts to grow and transform our businesses may require significant investments; if our strategies are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.We continuously evaluate opportunities for growth and change. These initiatives may involve making acquisitions, entering into partnerships and joint ventures, divesting assets, restructuring our existing operations and assets, creating new financial structures and building new facilities—any of which could require a significant investment and subject us to new risks. We may incur additional indebtedness to finance these opportunities. If our strategies for growth and change are not successful, we could face increased financial pressure, such as increased cash flow demands, reduced liquidity and diminished access to financial markets, and the equity value of our businesses could be diluted.The implementation of strategies for growth and change may create additional risks, including: ● diversion of management time and attention away from existing operations; ● requiring capital investment that could otherwise be used for the operation and growth of our existing businesses; ● disruptions to important business relationships; ● increased operating costs; ● limitations imposed by various governmental entities; and ● difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new markets we may enter.Our inability to mitigate these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our strategies for growth and change could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may fail to fully achieve the savings or growth projected for current or future initiatives notwithstanding the expenditure of substantial resources in pursuit thereof.23Table of ContentsOur review of potential strategic alternatives may not result in executed or consummated transactions or other strategic alternatives, and the process of reviewing strategic alternatives or its conclusion could adversely affect our business and our stockholders.In January 2024, we announced that we are reviewing potential strategic alternatives for DynaEnergetics and NobelClad aimed at maximizing value for our shareholders. The potential strategic alternatives include, among other things, a sale, a merger or other business combination of a portion of our business-unit assets, and/or a strategic investment. We are actively working with a financial advisor and may retain other advisors to assist the Board in evaluating our current strategy, operations, and capital structure.Any potential transaction or other strategic alternative would be dependent on a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other things, market conditions, industry trends, regulatory approvals, and the availability of financing for a potential transaction on reasonable terms. The process of reviewing potential strategic alternatives is time consuming and may be distracting and disruptive to our business operations and long-term planning, which may cause concern to our current or potential customers, employees, investors, strategic partners and other constituencies and may have a material impact on our business and operating results or result in increased volatility in our share price. We expect to incur substantial expenses associated with identifying, evaluating and negotiating potential strategic alternatives. There can be no assurance that any potential transaction or other strategic alternative, if consummated, will provide greater value to our stockholders than that reflected in the current price of our common stock. Until the review process is concluded, perceived uncertainties related to our future may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, volatility in the market price of our common stock and difficulty attracting and retaining qualified talent and business partners. Similarly, activist investors may engage in proxy solicitations or advance shareholder proposals, or otherwise attempt to affect changes and assert influence on our Board and management, which could lead to the impacts on our business, Board, management and employees discussed above.Our operations are subject to political and economic instability and risk of government actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. We are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries in which we operate. Our operations are subject to various risks unique to each country that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. With respect to any particular country, these risks may include:•political, social and economic instability; •civil unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war, other armed conflict;•public health crises and catastrophic events;•inflation;•currency fluctuations, devaluations, conversion, or repatriation restrictions;•expropriation and nationalization of our assets;•confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies;•theft of, or lack of sufficient legal protection for, proprietary technology and other intellectual property;•limitations on extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing;•limitations on or disruptions to our markets or operations, restrictions on payments, or limitations on the movement of funds;•increased tariffs;•trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions;•unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements, including changes in interpretation or enforcement of existing laws;•deprivation of contract rights; and•the inability to obtain or retain licenses required for operation.Inflation and higher interest rates have, and may continue to, adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Increases in the cost of wages, materials, parts, equipment, transportation and other operational components over the past two years have adversely affected our results of operations, cash flows and financial position by increasing our overall cost structure, and could continue to do so, particularly if we are unable to achieve commensurate increases in the prices we charge our customers for our products. In addition, higher interest rates in the U.S. have increased the cost of debt borrowing, which decreases cash available for debt repayment, investment, and acquisitions. 24Table of ContentsOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by disruptions in the global and European economies caused by the ongoing military action between Russia and Ukraine.In February of 2022, Russian military forces invaded Ukraine, resulting in conflict and disruption in the region. The length, impact and outcome of the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine is highly unpredictable. This conflict has led and may continue to lead to significant market and other disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices and supply of energy resources, instability in financial markets, higher inflation, supply chain interruptions, increased costs for transportation and raw materials, political and social instability, as well as an increase in cyberattacks and espionage. Furthermore, governments in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and others have imposed financial and economic sanctions on certain industry segments and various parties in Russia. We continue to monitor the conflict including the potential impact of financial and economic sanctions on the global economy and particularly the economies of Europe. Increased trade barriers, sanctions and other restrictions on global or regional trade could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further escalation of geopolitical tensions related to this military conflict and/or its expansion could result in loss of property, expropriation, cyberattacks, supply disruptions, plant closures and an inability to obtain key supplies and materials, as well as adversely affect both our and our customers' supply chains and logistics, particularly in Europe.In many cases, both our German operations and those of European customers and suppliers depend on the availability of natural gas for use in their manufacturing operations. A significant proportion of Germany's natural gas supply has historically originated from Russia. Material disruptions of natural gas supply to Europe and in particular Germany, whether from sanctions, counter-measures by Russia, other restrictions, damage to infrastructure and logistics or otherwise from the destabilizing effects of military conflict could materially and adversely impact European and global natural gas and oil markets. We expect that shortages in supply and increases in costs of natural gas or other energy will adversely impact our ability to operate our German manufacturing facilities as efficiently and cost-effectively as previously, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter.We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in annual and quarterly operating results caused by various factors at our businesses. At NobelClad, quarterly sales and operating results depend on the volume and timing of the orders in our backlog as well as bookings during the quarter. At DynaEnergetics, the level of demand from our customers is impacted by oil and gas prices as well as a variety of other factors and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. At Arcadia Products, operating results can fluctuate due to price movements in the market for raw aluminum. Portions of our operating expenses are fixed, and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts and product development programs. If sales do not meet our expectations in any given period, the adverse impact on operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust operating expenses sufficiently or quickly enough to compensate for such a shortfall. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results for any future period.We are exposed to potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against the currencies of many of our operating subsidiaries. Many of our operating subsidiaries conduct business in euros, Canadian dollars, or other foreign currencies. Sales made in currencies other than U.S. dollars accounted for 9%, 6%, and 16% of total sales for the years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Any increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of any of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience foreign currency translation gains or losses with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. In addition, our company and our operating subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we or they enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or their respective functional currencies. For example, DynaEnergetics Europe's functional currency is euros, but its sales often occur in U.S. dollars. Changes in exchange rates with respect to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. In addition, we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to our operating subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities and to the financial results of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in other cumulative comprehensive loss as a separate component of equity. Our primary exposure to foreign currency risk is the euro, due to the percentage of our U.S. dollar revenue that is derived from countries where the euro is the functional currency. We use foreign currency forward contracts, generally with maturities of one month, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated asset and liability account balances. These hedge transactions relate to our operating entities with significant economic exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. Our primary economic 25Table of Contentsexposures include the U.S. dollar to the euro, the U.S. dollar to the Canadian dollar, and the euro to the U.S. dollar. Since the underlying balance sheet account balances being hedged can fluctuate significantly throughout our monthly hedge periods, our hedging program cannot fully protect against foreign currency fluctuations.Disruptions or delays involving our suppliers or increases in prices for the components, raw materials and parts that we obtain from our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations. Our operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the components, raw materials and parts that we need to manufacture our products. In some instances, we purchase components, raw materials and parts that are ultimately derived from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. Any number of factors, including labor disruptions, acts of war or terrorism, military activity, trade sanctions, catastrophic weather events, the occurrence of a pandemic or other widespread illness (such as the resurgence of COVID-19), contractual or other disputes, unfavorable economic or industry conditions, transportation disruptions, delivery delays or other performance problems or financial difficulties or solvency problems, could disrupt our suppliers’ operations and performance, which could, in turn, lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions for us and disrupt our operations. If we experience supply disruptions, we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly. Any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of components, raw materials or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules or suspend production entirely, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.The terms of our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants, the breach of any of which could result in acceleration of payment of our credit facilities.As of December 31, 2023, we had an outstanding balance of $117.5 million on our syndicated credit agreement, which was subsequently amended on February 6, 2024. This agreement, as amended, includes various covenants and restrictions and certain of these relate to the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the mortgaging, pledging or disposing of major assets. We are also required to maintain certain financial ratios on a quarterly basis. A breach of any of these covenants could impair our ability to borrow and could result in acceleration of our obligations to repay our debt if we are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment from our lenders. As of December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and other provisions of the credit agreement, as amended, and our other loan agreements. Any failure to remain in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our credit agreement could result in a default, which would, absent a waiver or amendment, require immediate repayment of outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities. We may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to satisfy such a repayment obligation. If our customers delay paying or fail to pay a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. We depend on a limited number of significant customers in our DynaEnergetics and NobelClad businesses, and the loss of one or more significant customers or the failure of a customer to pay outstanding amounts due could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated results of operations. In most cases, we bill our customers for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to the risk that our customers will delay payment of or fail to pay our invoices. In weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers’ cash flow from operations, their access to the credit markets and rising interest rates. If our customers delay paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.New or existing tariffs and other trade measures could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.New or existing tariffs and other trade measures could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows, either directly or indirectly through various adverse impacts on our significant customers. In 2018, the U.S. announced tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum imported from countries where we typically source metals. These tariffs were met with retaliatory tariffs from certain countries and increased, broader tariffs were levied by the U.S. on targeted countries, including China. Certain of these tariffs have been modified; however, impacts and uncertainties are continuing. The tariffs impacted the cost of the importation of steel, which we utilize in our steel plate and steel pipe, key materials in our NobelClad and DynaEnergetics businesses. Though in many cases we have been able to source metals from domestic suppliers, some materials are only available from sources subject to tariffs. The cost of domestic steel and aluminum has also increased, along with the price of delivery, and the availability of certain materials has been limited. These higher costs have increased the price of our products to our customers and, in some instances, affected our ability to be competitive. For our 26Table of ContentsNobelClad business, this impacts our ability to compete on international projects and negatively impacts U.S. fabricators, which are the primary consumers of NobelClad products. Although some of these tariffs have been subsequently reduced or eliminated, as occurred in connection with the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA), many tariffs continue to exist and new tariffs have been and may be imposed at any time. The prolonged duration of tariffs, the imposition of additional tariffs and the risk of potential broader global trade conflicts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Failure to attract and retain key personnel and source sufficient labor could adversely affect our current operating results.Our continued success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical employees, and our ability to secure sufficient manufacturing labor. In 2023, there were significant changes in our management team, including the appointment of Michael Kuta as Chief Executive Officer (following his prior service as Chief Financial Officer and interim co-Chief Executive Officer), the appointment of Eric Walter as Chief Financial Officer, the appointment of Brett Seger as Chief Accounting Officer, and the appointment of James Chilcoff as Arcadia Products President. Our current and future success is dependent on the retention of these and other executive officers, key employees and directors. The loss or unavailability of any key personnel could have an adverse effect on the Company’s leadership, ability to execute our strategy, financial condition and results of operations.  In order to meet the needs and expectations of our customers and to achieve our growth objectives, we must attract, train, and retain a large number of hourly associates, while at the same time controlling labor costs. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training, retention and other costs. In certain areas where we operate, there is significant competition for employees, and we must ensure that we continue to offer competitive wages, benefits and workplace conditions to retain qualified employees, which increases our labor costs. A shortage of qualified candidates who meet all legal work authorization requirements, failure to hire and retain new employees in a timely manner or higher than expected turnover levels could affect our ability to meet customer demand, grow our businesses and meet our labor cost objectives and could have impacts on employee satisfaction generally. Failure to adequately monitor and proactively respond to employee dissatisfaction could lead to higher turnover, litigation and unionization efforts, which could negatively impact our ability to meet our operating results.A failure in our information technology systems or those of third parties, including those caused by security breaches, cyber-attacks or data protection failures, could disrupt our business, result in significant legal costs and other losses and damage our reputation. We are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our operations. Our information technology systems are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and banking information and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. The risk of cybersecurity incidents may increase with political and economic instability or warfare (including the ongoing hostilities between Russia and Ukraine). Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, theft, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, a data breach could result in negative publicity which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our stock price.We outsource certain technology and business process functions to third parties and may increasingly do so in the future. If we do not effectively develop, implement and monitor our outsourcing strategy, if third party providers do not perform as anticipated or if we experience technological or other problems with a transition, we may not realize productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and loss of business. Our outsourcing of certain technology and business processes to third parties may expose us to enhanced risks related to data security, which could result in monetary and reputational damages. In addition, our ability to receive services from third party providers may be impacted by cultural differences, political instability, and unanticipated regulatory requirements or policies. As a result, our ability to conduct our business may be adversely affected.27Table of ContentsFailure to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting could result in the inability to report our financial results in a timely and reliable manner, which could harm our business and impact the value of our securities.We depend on our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements in order to run our business. If we fail to do so, our business could be negatively affected and our independent registered public accounting firm may be unable to attest to the fair presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be harmed. Even effective internal controls have inherent limitations including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or a deterioration in the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures.If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls, including any failure to implement new or improved controls as may be required by acquisitions or other changes in our business, or if we experience difficulties in their execution, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In the event that our current internal control practices deteriorate, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and investor confidence and the market price of our stock may be adversely affected.Legal and Regulatory RisksOur operations require us to comply with numerous laws and regulations, violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.Our operations are subject to international, regional, national, and local laws and regulations in every place where we operate, relating to matters such as environmental protection, health and safety, labor and employment, import/export controls, currency exchange, bribery and corruption, data privacy and cybersecurity, intellectual property, immigration, and taxation. These laws and regulations are complex, frequently change, and have tended to become more stringent over time. In the event the scope of these laws and regulations expands in the future, the incremental cost of compliance could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations, or consolidated cash flows.Our international operations are subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations, such as the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other similar laws. We are also subject to trade control regulations and trade sanctions laws that restrict the movement of certain goods to, and certain operations in, various countries or with certain persons. These trade regulations and laws can include restrictions on selling or importing goods, services or technology in or from affected regions, travel bans and asset freezes impacting connected individuals and political, military, business and financial organizations and can change very quickly, such as has occurred in connection with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Our ability to transfer people, products and data among certain countries is subject to maintaining required licenses and complying with these laws and regulations.The internal controls, policies and procedures, and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or from material violations of applicable laws and regulations. Any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of anti-bribery, trade control, trade sanctions or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Violations of international and U.S. laws and regulations or the loss of any required licenses may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies or restrictions on business conduct, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. In addition, any major violations could have a significant effect on our reputation and consequently on our ability to win future business and maintain existing customer and supplier relationships.The use of explosives in our DynaEnergetics and NobelClad manufacturing processes and products subject us to additional environmental, health and safety laws and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities.DynaEnergetics uses explosive materials in its manufacturing processes and products. NobelClad’s manufacturing process involves the detonation of large quantities of explosives. The use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity. These activities subject us to extensive environmental and health and safety laws and regulations including guidelines and regulations for the purchase, manufacture, handling, transport, storage and use of explosives issued by the U.S. Bureau of 28Table of ContentsAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety regulations set forth by the U.S. Department of Transportation; the Safety Library Publications of the Institute of Makers of Explosive; and similar guidelines of their European counterparts. In Germany, the transport, storage and use of explosives is governed by a permit issued under the Explosives Act (Sprengstoffgesetz). Despite our use of specialized facilities to store and handle dangerous materials and our employee training programs, the storage and handling of explosive materials could result in explosive incidents that temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupt our or our customers’ operations or cause restrictions, delays or cancellations in the delivery of our services. It is possible that such an explosion could result in death or significant injuries to employees and other persons. Material property damage to us, our customers and third parties arising from an explosion or resulting fire could also occur. Any explosion could expose us to adverse publicity and liability for damages or cause production restrictions, delays or cancellations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable requirements or the occurrence of an explosive incident may also result in the loss of our license to store and handle explosives, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions.Demand for our products could be reduced by existing and future legislation, regulations and public sentiment. Regulatory agencies and environmental advocacy groups in the United States, the E.U., and other regions or countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their role in climate change. There is also increased focus, including by governments and our customers, investors and other stakeholders, on these and other sustainability and energy transition matters. Existing or future legislation and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, as well as initiatives by governments, non-governmental organizations, and companies to conserve energy or promote the use of alternative energy sources, and negative attitudes toward or perceptions of fossil fuel products and their relationship to the environment, may significantly curtail demand for and production of oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and thus reduce future demand for some of our products. In addition, some international, national, state and local governments and agencies have also adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on directly limiting the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing. These laws and regulations could limit oil and gas development, lead to operational delays and increased costs for our customers, and therefore reduce demand for our products. Such reductions in demand for our products may, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Increased negative investor sentiment toward oil and gas and preference for assets outside of traditional energy sectors could lead to higher capital costs for our customers and reduced investment in fossil fuels, thereby reducing demand for our products. Such preferences could also impact our ability to obtain acceptable debt or equity financing on attractive terms or at all and could negatively impact our stock price over time. Our business, reputation and demand for our stock could be negatively affected if we do not (or are perceived to not) act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters.We are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. We are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulation in the United States and the other countries where our manufacturing facilities are located. Among other things, these laws regulate the emissions or discharge of materials into the environment; govern the use, storage, treatment, disposal and management of hazardous substances and wastes; protect the health and safety of our employees; regulate the materials used in our products or manufacturing processes; and impose liability for the costs of investigating and remediating (as well as other damages resulting from) present and past releases of hazardous substances. Representative laws and regulations which we may be subject to the in the U.S. include: noise abatement and air emissions regulations, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state laws, and various regulations and laws enforced by the U.S Department of Labor, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and their state equivalents. Violations of these laws or of any conditions contained in environmental permits can result in substantial fines or penalties, injunctive relief, requirements to install pollution controls or other equipment, and civil sanctions. We could be held liable for costs to investigate, remediate or otherwise address contamination at any real property we have ever owned, operated or used as a disposal site, or at other sites where we or predecessors may have released hazardous materials. We could incur fines, penalties or sanctions or be subject to third-party claims, including indemnification claims, for property damage, personal injury or otherwise as a result of violations of (or liabilities under) environmental, health and safety laws, or in connection with releases of hazardous or other materials.29Table of ContentsChanges in or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or enforcement policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of other environmental liabilities or obligations in the future including additional investigation, remediation or other obligations with respect to our products or business activities may lead to additional compliance costs or require us to change our manufacturing processes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.In Germany, we and all our activities are subject to various safety and environmental regulations of the federal state which are enforced by the local authorities, including the Federal Act on Emission Control (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz). The Federal Act on Emission Control permits are held by companies jointly owned by DynaEnergetics and the other companies that are located at the Troisdorf manufacturing site and are for an indefinite period of time. The Dillenburg, Germany facility is operated based on a specific permit granted by the local mountain authority and must be renewed every three years. Any failure to comply with current and future environmental and safety regulations could subject us to significant liabilities. Any actual or alleged violations of environmental, health or safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities or substantial civil or criminal sanctions. In addition, under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our facilities and at third party waste disposal sites, even when such contamination was caused by a predecessor and even when the actions resulting in the contamination were lawful at the time. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage. Failure to comply with applicable federal, state and local employment and labor laws and regulations could have a material, adverse impact on our business. Various federal, state and local employment and labor laws and regulations govern our relationships with our employees, and similar laws and regulations apply to our operations outside of the U.S. These laws and regulations relate to matters such as employment discrimination, wage and hour laws, requirements to provide and document meal and rest periods or other benefits, family leave mandates, requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements, insurance and workers’ compensation rules, healthcare laws and anti-discrimination and anti-harassment laws. We incur substantial costs to comply with these laws and regulations and non-compliance could expose us to significant liabilities. For example, Arcadia Products is currently defending a lawsuit in California alleging violations of wage and hour regulations with respect to certain temporary and permanent employees. We are incurring legal costs to defend this action and may in the future be required to defend similar actions, and we could incur losses from these and similar cases, and the amount of such losses or costs could be material. Several jurisdictions also have implemented sick pay and paid time off legislation, which requires employers to provide paid time off to employees, and “just cause” termination legislation, which restricts companies’ ability to terminate employees or reduce employees’ hours unless they can prove “just cause” or a “bona fide economic reason” for the termination or reduction in hours. All of these regulations impose additional obligations on us and our failure to comply with any of these regulations could subject us to penalties and other legal liabilities, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  The regulatory environment governing information, data security and privacy is increasingly demanding and evolving and a data security breach could result in litigation, enforcement actions and related penalties and fines.The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. We are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state laws and non-U.S. laws and regulations governing the protection of personal and confidential information of our customers and employees. The regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future.Several U.S. states have passed comprehensive privacy laws that have recently become effective. Of note among them is the California Consumer Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which amends and expands the California Consumer Privacy (CCPA). The CPRA, which went into effect on January 1, 2023, along with the CCPA, governs the transmission, security and privacy of California residents’ personal information. The CPRA has a twelve month look-back period for enforcement purposes. Among many new requirements, the CPRA creates a category for sensitive data including health and other personal information that requires additional safeguards and disclosures. In addition, the CPRA expands consumers’ rights and has enhanced enforcement mechanisms such as the creation of a California Privacy Protection Agency that will investigate and enforce the CPRA and its promulgating regulations. The states of Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut and Utah have also recently enacted omnibus data privacy laws.  In addition, many other proposals exist in states across the U.S. that could increase our potential liability and increase our compliance costs. Aspects of these state privacy statutes remain unclear, resulting in further legal uncertainty and potentially requiring us to modify our data practices and policies and to incur substantial additional compliance costs.30Table of ContentsIn addition, the recently adopted SEC final cybersecurity rule requires, among other things, comprehensive disclosure regarding oversight of cybersecurity risks and increased monitoring and reporting of data security incidents.Internationally, the European Data Protection Board has released guidelines on enforcement and fines related to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The guidelines suggest a tougher stance on enforcement and stiffer fines for companies that violate the GDPR. This is in addition to the continued complexities involving the transfer of personal data from Europe to the U.S. following the Schrems II decision. In July 2023, the European Commission announced a new Trans-Atlantic data privacy framework, Privacy Shield 2.0, which may require additional compliance efforts from our company.As international data privacy and protection laws continue to evolve, and as new regulations, interpretive guidance and enforcement information become available, we may incur incremental costs to modify our business practices to comply with these requirements. In addition, our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless, intentional or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents.Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could subject us to criminal or civil, monetary or non-monetary penalties, disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction, subject us to class action lawsuits and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, including proposals to restrict emissions of GHGs and other sustainability initiatives, could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business and results of operations.Various legislative, regulatory, and inter-governmental proposals to restrict emissions of GHGs, such as carbon dioxide (“CO2”), are under consideration by governmental legislative bodies and regulators in the jurisdictions where we operate.  Such regulatory and global initiatives may require us to modify our operating procedures, incur capital expenditures, change fuel sources, or take other actions that may adversely affect our financial results.  Increasing regulations to reduce GHG emissions, as proposed throughout many of our operating regions, would be expected to increase energy costs, reduce energy availability and increase price volatility for energy.The heightened stakeholder focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance, or “ESG,” issues related to our businesses requires the continuous monitoring of various and evolving laws, regulations, standards and expectations and the associated reporting requirements. Specifically, certain stakeholders are beginning to require that we provide information on our plans relating to certain climate-related matters such as greenhouse gas emissions, and we expect this trend to continue and be amplified by the potential adoption of the proposed SEC regulations relating to climate change disclosure. A failure to adequately or timely meet stakeholder expectations and reporting requirements may result in noncompliance with any imposed regulations, the loss of business, reputational impacts, diluted market valuation, an inability to attract and retain customers, and an inability to attract and retain top talent.  In addition, our adoption and the reporting of certain standards or mandated compliance to certain requirements could necessitate additional investments that could impact our profitability.  Further, we have established and publicly disclosed other ESG targets and goals and other sustainability commitments that are subject to a variety of assumptions, risks and uncertainties. If we are unable to meet these targets, goals or commitments on our projected timelines or at all, or if they are not perceived to be sufficiently robust, our reputation as well as our relationships with investors, customers and other stakeholders could be harmed, which could in turn adversely impact our business and results of operations. In addition, not all of our competitors may seek to establish climate or other ESG targets and goals, or at a comparable level to ours, which could result in our competitors achieving competitive advantages through lower supply chain or operating costs.Changes in or interpretation of tax law could impact the determination of our income tax liabilities for a tax year.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is subjective or uncertain. We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S and have significant intercompany transactions between our affiliates. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or disputes about intercompany transfer pricing arrangements may result in higher effective tax rates for the Company. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or their interpretation, both domestically and internationally. For example, regulations related to the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) are still being 31Table of Contentsdeveloped, some with retroactive application. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to tax law, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial condition or results of operations. The OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project (or BEPS Project) is developing an international framework to combat tax avoidance by multinational enterprises and countries where the Company is subject to taxes are independently evaluating their corporate tax policy. Tax legislation and enforcement could adversely impact the Company’s tax provision and the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities. We are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions from time to time. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. The final resolution of any audits or litigation may differ from the amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements and may materially affect our Consolidated Financial Statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made.Intellectual Property RisksOur failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position. The protection of our intellectual property rights is essential to maintaining our competitive position and recognizing the value of our investments in technology and intellectual property in our existing and future products. We rely on trade secret protection for certain aspects of our technology, in part through confidentiality and other written agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties. Through these and other written agreements, we attempt to control access to and distribution of our intellectual property documentation and other proprietary technology information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, former employees, consultants or third parties may, in an unauthorized manner, attempt to use, copy or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property rights or technology or otherwise develop a product with the same functionality as our technology. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights is difficult, and nearly impossible on a worldwide basis. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property rights.We also actively pursue patent protection for our proprietary technology and intellectual property where appropriate for protecting our competitive position. The process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and we cannot be certain that any currently pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents, or that, even if patents are issued, they will be respected by third parties. In addition, our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets, and this could have a similar effect on our competitive position.Intellectual property litigation and threats of litigation are becoming more common in the oilfield services industry. We are currently involved and may in the future be involved in litigation, in the United States or abroad, to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to protect our trade secrets and know-how. These actions can require multiple years to come to resolution or settlement, and even if we ultimately prevail, we may be unable to realize adequate protection of our competitive position. In addition, these actions commonly result in actions by the affected third parties to establish the invalidity of our patents. While we intend to prosecute these actions vigorously, there is no guarantee of success, and such effort takes significant financial and management resources from the Company. In the event that one or more of our patents are challenged, a court or the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) may invalidate the patent(s) or determine that the patent(s) is not enforceable, which could harm our competitive position. If our patents are invalidated, or if the scope of the claims in any of these patents is limited by a court or USPTO decision, we could be prevented from pursuing certain litigation matters or licensing the invalidated or limited portion of such patents. Such adverse decisions could negatively impact our future revenue. Patent litigation, if necessary or when instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources.We may incur substantial costs defending against third parties alleging that we infringe their proprietary rights.We are currently involved and may in the future be involved in litigation relating to alleged infringement by us of others’ patents or other intellectual property rights. We have an active ""freedom to operate"" review process for our technology, but there is no assurance that future infringement claims will not be asserted. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core businesses even if we are ultimately successful. In the event of any adverse ruling in any intellectual property litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacturing, use and sale of infringing products, discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain a license from the third-32Table of Contentsparty claiming infringement with royalty payment obligations by us. We also have certain indemnification obligations to customers with respect to the infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products, which may increase our costs. Any of these occurrences could significantly harm our competitive position, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Risks Related to AcquisitionsWe have incurred debt to finance the acquisition of 60% of Arcadia Products and may incur additional substantial financial obligations in connection with the acquisition of the remaining 40% of Arcadia Products.We financed a portion of the purchase price of the Arcadia Products acquisition with proceeds from our credit facility. Our ability to service the indebtedness under the credit facility and to maintain compliance with the covenants included in the credit facility will depend on our success in achieving the intended benefits of the acquisition, which is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as discussed above. We will have to devote a substantial portion of our cash flow to meet required payments of principal and interest on this indebtedness, and if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to do so, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the terms of the credit facility, we could be in default under the agreement. In addition, as early as three years after the closing of the Arcadia Products acquisition, we may be required to pay the Option Purchase Price for some or all of Munera’s interests in Arcadia Products if Munera exercises the Put Option. Even if we elect to pay 80% of the Option Purchase Price in preferred stock, we will need to fund the remaining portion in cash. We recently amended our credit facility, increasing the total facility amount to $300 million from our prior facility of $200 million. While the increase in the credit facility was intended to allow us to finance the Option Purchase Price, a potential exercise will depend on numerous factors, including the performance of our businesses, the status of any changes to our businesses and general market and economic conditions. If we fail to pay the Option Purchase Price when required under the Operating Agreement, we will be in default under the agreement. The Option Purchase Price is likely to be substantial relative to the current size of our business. In addition, the Option Purchase Price is subject to a defined “floor” value in the Operating Agreement, which is based primarily upon a contractually stated equity value. The floor value will apply even if Arcadia Products' performance fails to meet our expectations, and we may find it difficult to obtain additional financing, if needed, for the payment of the Option Purchase Price. In addition, debt or preferred equity financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include liens or restrictions on our assets and covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as paying dividends or making distributions, incurring additional debt, acquiring or disposing of assets or increasing expenses. Debt financing would also be required to be repaid regardless of our operating results. Obtaining financing through issuances of common stock would impose fewer restrictions on our future operations but would be dilutive to the interests of existing stockholders.DMC is the majority shareholder of Arcadia Products, and our interest in Arcadia Products is subject to the risks normally associated with the conduct of businesses with a minority shareholder.Pursuant to the Equity Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we acquired a 60% ownership stake in Arcadia Products, Munera continues to hold 40% of the outstanding equity interests of Arcadia Products.  Our Operating Agreement governs our relationship with Munera, and we believe the Operating Agreement provides us with effective and sufficient control of Arcadia Products to allow the business to be operated consistent with our goals and values and with sufficient opportunity for profitable growth. Nevertheless, conducting a business with minority owners may lead to certain risks and uncertainties, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to profitably grow the Arcadia Products business, which could have a material adverse impact on our future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition. These include:•our ability to effectively control certain strategic, operational and financial decisions;•the potential for disagreement over the direction of the company and costs and expenses involved; and•the risk of having economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with, or opposed to, those of Munera.There can be no assurance that the acquisition will be beneficial to us, whether due to the above-described risks, unfavorable economic conditions, integration challenges or other factors.To the extent that we seek to further expand our business through acquisitions, we may experience issues in executing acquisitions or integrating acquired operations. From time to time, we examine opportunities to make selective acquisitions in order to increase shareholder return by increasing our total available markets, expanding our existing operations and, potentially, generating synergies. The success of any acquisition depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: 33Table of Contents•identifying suitable candidates for acquisition and negotiating acceptable terms; •obtaining approval from regulatory authorities and potentially DMC’s shareholders; •maintaining our financial and strategic focus and avoiding distraction of management during the process of integrating the acquired business; •implementing our standards, controls, procedures and policies at the acquired business and addressing any pre-existing liabilities or claims involving the acquired business; •our ability to realize the expected tax treatment or tax benefits from the transaction; and •to the extent the acquired operations are in a country in which we have not operated historically, understanding the regulations and challenges of operating in that new jurisdiction.For example, our due diligence process may not reveal all liabilities associated with a potential acquisition, and this could result in us incurring unanticipated losses after the acquisition is completed. There can be no assurance that we will be able to conclude any acquisitions successfully or that any acquisition will achieve the anticipated synergies or other positive results. Any material problems that we encounter in connection with such an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Risk Factors

Risk Factors
 Related to ArcadiaNorth American and global economic and industry-related business conditions materially affect our sales and results of operations.Our Arcadia businesses are significantly influenced by North American economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the North American commercial and residential construction industry. The construction industry is impacted by macroeconomic trends, such as availability of credit, employment levels, consumer confidence, interest rates and commodity prices. In addition, changes in architectural design trends, demographic trends, and/or remote work trends could negatively impact demand for our products. To the extent changes in these factors negatively impact the overall commercial construction industry, our revenue and profits could be significantly reduced. The markets in which Arcadia operates are highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and better capitalized than we are. These competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within the industries and markets in which we operate and may have significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we have. Moreover, barriers to entry are low in certain product lines and new competitors may enter our industry, whether within the U.S. or internationally. An increase in competition, including in the form of aggressive pricing by new market entrants or offerings of alternative building materials, could cause us to lose customers and lead to decreases in net sales and profitability if we are not able to respond adequately to such challenges. The actions of our existing competitors or new competitors could result in loss of customers and/or market share. Changes in our competitors' products, prices or services could negatively impact our market share, net sales and/or margins.An inability to successfully develop new products or improve existing products could negatively impact our ability to attract new customers and/or retain existing customers.Our success depends on meeting consumer needs and anticipating changes in consumer preferences with successful new products and product improvements. We aim to introduce products and new or improved production processes proactively to offset obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products. While we devote significant focus to the development of new products, we may not be successful in product development and our new products may not be commercially successful. In addition, it is possible that competitors may improve their products more rapidly or effectively, which could adversely affect our sales. Furthermore, market demand may decline as a result of consumer preferences trending away from our categories or trending down within our brands or product categories, which could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.If we are unable to manage our supply chain effectively, including availability and price of materials used in our products, our results of operations will be negatively affected.We obtain a significant portion of our key raw materials, such as aluminum extrusions, from a few key suppliers. While we structure many of our supply arrangements to moderate the effects of fluctuations in the market for raw aluminum and we endeavor to adjust our pricing to offset potential impacts, operating results could be negatively impacted by price movements in the market for raw aluminum. In recent years, we have seen increased volatility in the price of aluminum that we purchase from our key suppliers. 17Table of ContentsOur suppliers are subject to fluctuations in general economic cycles. Global economic conditions and political and economic instability may impact their ability to operate their businesses, including continuing impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing military action between Russia and Ukraine and related government actions. Our suppliers may also be impacted by the increasing costs or availability of raw materials, labor and transportation. Some of our suppliers may not be able to handle commodity cost volatility or changing volumes while still performing up to our specifications. These factors may cause suppliers to be unable to meet their commitments or to negatively change the terms of the supply arrangements.The loss of, or substantial decrease in the availability of, products from our suppliers, or the loss of a key supplier, could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. If any of our key suppliers are unable to meet their commitments, or if those supply arrangements are terminated, we may not be able to obtain certain raw materials on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and may suffer a significant interruption in our ability to manufacture our products, including because it may be difficult to find substitute or alternate suppliers as the aluminum extrusions we use are customized. We could also be required to maintain higher inventory levels as we address supply uncertainties. Such developments would result in higher costs and ultimately a decrease in our revenues and profitability. If our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our delivery times are extended, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Product quality issues and product liability claims could adversely affect our operating results.We believe that future orders of our products will depend on our ability to maintain the performance, reliability, quality and timely delivery standards required by our customers. We have in the past been and currently are subject to product liability and warranty claims. If our products have performance, reliability or quality problems, or products are installed improperly, we may experience additional warranty expense; reduced or canceled orders; or delays in the collection of accounts receivable. Additionally, product liability and warranty claims could result in costly and time-consuming litigation that could require significant time and attention of management and involve significant monetary damages that could negatively impact our operating results. There is no assurance that the number and value of product liability and warranty claims will not increase as compared to historical claim rates, or that our warranty reserve at any particular time will be sufficient. No assurance can be given that coverage under insurance policies, if applicable, will be adequate to cover future product liability claims against us. If we are unable to recover on insurance claims, in whole or in part, or if we exhaust our available insurance coverage at some point in the future, then we might be forced to expend legal fees and settlement or judgment costs relating to product liability and warranty claims, which could negatively impact our profitability, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Risk Factors
 Related to DynaEnergeticsDemand for DynaEnergetics’ products is substantially dependent on the levels of capital expenditures by the oil and gas industry. Decreases or expected decreases in oil and gas prices and reduced expenditures in the oil and gas industry could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Demand for the majority of DynaEnergetics' products depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry’s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. Higher oil and gas prices have resulted in increasing North American completion activity and increased expenditures by the oil and gas industry. This has resulted in increased cash flows for E&P companies; however, E&P companies are still seeking to control their cost of operations and this has continued to result in downward pressure on prices for our products. In addition, the oil and gas industry has historically been cyclical, and to date in 2023, oil prices have declined significantly from their 2022 highs. When oil prices decline, we would expect an increased risk of reduced or delayed oil and gas exploration and production spending, project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us, all of which could result in reduced demand for our products, downward pressure on selling prices for our products and decreased revenues and profits. These effects would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and can be affected by a variety of factors, including:  •changes in the supply of and demand for hydrocarbons, which are affected by general economic, business and regulatory conditions;•the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and other oil producing companies to set and maintain production levels for oil;18Table of Contents•oil and gas production levels in the U.S. and in other non-OPEC countries;•the level of excess production capacity;•speculation as to the future price of oil and the speculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts;•government initiatives to restrict oil and gas drilling or development or promote the use of renewable energy sources and public sentiment regarding the same;•political and economic uncertainty, geopolitical unrest, and acts of war;•the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and production activity;•access to potential resources;•changes in governmental policies, subsidies, or sanctions;•the costs of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;•technological advances affecting energy consumption; and•weather conditions.Continued or worsening conditions in the oil and gas industry generally may have a further material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.Failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customer demands could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing, internal fabrication utilization and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customer requirements. Factors that can impact our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements include the short-term nature of many customers’ commitments, our customers’ ability to reschedule, cancel and modify orders with little or no notice and without significant penalty, the accuracy of our customers’ forecasts, and seasonal or cyclical trends in customers' industries. To ensure availability of our products, particularly for our largest customers, we may start manufacturing our relevant products based on our customers’ forecasts, which are not binding. As a result, we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales that may never materialize or which may be substantially lower than expected. If actual demand for our products is lower than forecast, we may also experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and product obsolescence. Because certain of our sales, research and development, and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income. Conversely, customers often require rapid increases in production on short notice. We may be unable to secure sufficient materials or contract manufacturing capacity to meet such increases in demand. This could damage our customer relationships, reduce revenue growth and margins, subject us to additional liabilities, harm our reputation, and prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities.Failure to manage periods of growth or contraction may seriously harm our business.Our industry frequently sees periods of expansion and contraction which require companies to adjust to customers’ needs and market demands. We regularly contend with these issues and must carefully manage our business to meet customer and market requirements. If we fail to manage these growth and contraction decisions effectively, we may find ourselves with either excess or insufficient resources and our business and our profitability could suffer as a result.Periods of contraction or reduced net sales, or other factors negatively affecting particular markets, require us to assess whether facilities remain viable, whether staffing levels need to be reduced, and how to respond to changing levels of customer demand. While maintaining excess capacity or higher levels of employment entails short-term costs, reductions in capacity or employment could impair our ability to respond to new opportunities and programs, market improvements or to maintain customer relationships. Our decisions to reduce costs and capacity can affect our short-term and long-term results and result in restructuring charges.Expansions, including the transfer of operations to other facilities, include the risk of additional costs and start-up inefficiencies. If we are unable to effectively manage our expansion projects or related anticipated net sales are not realized, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.19Table of ContentsWe may not be able to continue to compete successfully against other companies in our industry.The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. DynaEnergetics competes with a broad spectrum of companies that produce and market perforating services and products. Many of these companies are large national and multi-national companies, including the oil and natural gas industry’s largest oilfield service providers. These companies have longer operating histories, greater financial, technical, and other resources, and greater name recognition than we do. In addition, we compete with many smaller companies capable of competing effectively on a regional or local basis. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. To remain competitive, DynaEnergetics must continue to provide innovative products at competitive prices and maintain an excellent reputation for value, quality, on-time delivery, and safety. If we fail to compete successfully against our competition, we may be unable to maintain acceptable sales levels, prices and margins for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.If we are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, and technology trends, our business and consolidated results of operations and the value of our intellectual property could be materially and adversely affected. The market for our products is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better and more reliable performance and enhanced product offerings. If we are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, and technology trends, our business and consolidated results of operations and the value of our intellectual property could be materially and adversely affected. Likewise, if our proprietary technologies, equipment, facilities, or work processes become obsolete, we may no longer be competitive, and our business and consolidated results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Demand for DynaEnergetics products could be reduced by existing and future legislation, regulations and public sentiment. Regulatory agencies and environmental advocacy groups in the United States, the E.U., and other regions or countries have been focusing considerable attention on emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their role in climate change. There is also increased focus, including by governments and our customers, investors and other stakeholders, on these and other sustainability and energy transition matters. Existing or future legislation and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, as well as initiatives by governments, non-governmental organizations, and companies to conserve energy or promote the use of alternative energy sources, and negative attitudes toward or perceptions of fossil fuel products and their relationship to the environment, may significantly curtail demand for and production of oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and thus reduce future demand for DynaEnergetics products. In addition, some international, national, state and local governments and agencies have also adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on directly limiting the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing. These laws and regulations could limit oil and gas development, lead to operational delays and increased costs for our customers, and therefore reduce demand for DynaEnergetics' products. Such reductions in demand for our products may, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Increased negative investor sentiment toward oil and gas and preference for assets outside of traditional energy sectors could lead to higher capital costs for our customers and reduced investment in fossil fuels, thereby reducing demand for our products. Such preferences could also impact our ability to obtain acceptable debt or equity financing on attractive terms or at all and could negatively impact our stock price over time. Our business, reputation and demand for our stock could be negatively affected if we do not (or are perceived to not) act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters.Risk Factors
 Related to NobelCladNobelClad’s business is dependent on sales to a limited number of customers in cyclical markets and our results are affected by the price of metals. NobelClad revenues are affected both by the demand for NobelClad’s explosion-welded cladding services and the base price of metal used in explosion-welded cladding operations. The explosion-welded cladding market is dependent upon sales of products for use by customers in a limited number of heavy industries, including oil and gas, chemicals and petrochemicals, alternative energy, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, rail car manufacturing, power generation, and industrial refrigeration. These industries tend to be cyclical in nature and an economic slowdown in one or all of these 20Table of Contentsindustries-whether due to traditional cyclicality, general economic conditions or other factors-could impact capital expenditures within that industry. The COVID-19 pandemic, government actions taken in response, and resulting economic impacts, including inflationary conditions in many markets, have created uncertainty in our end markets, and we have seen continued delays in projects and capital expenditures. In addition, metals prices affect the demand for cladded products and our margins. Although higher metal prices increase demand for use of cladded materials over solid metals, lead to higher sales (in terms of dollars rather than square meters of cladding) and generally higher margins for NobelClad, metal pricing is volatile. We have  recently experienced several years of a low-metals-price environment, which significantly reduced demand for clad product and overall sales. In the last two years, the price of metals has increased substantially. However, there can be no assurance that prices will remain at these levels and supply chain difficulties and other uncertainties have disrupted projects and normal sales cycles. If demand or metals prices decline or if supply chain issues or similar disruptions persist, our sales would be adversely affected, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We are dependent on a relatively small number of large projects and customers for a significant portion of our net sales.A significant portion of our net sales is derived from a relatively small number of projects and customers; therefore, the failure to complete existing contracts on a timely basis, to receive payment for such services in a timely manner, or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect our ability to meet cash requirements exclusively through operating activities. We attempt to minimize the risk of losing customers or specific contracts by continually improving commercial execution and product quality, delivering product on time and competing aggressively on the basis of price. We expect to continue to depend upon our principal customers for a significant portion of our sales, although our principal customers may not continue to purchase products and services from us at current levels, if at all. The loss of one or more major customers or a change in their buying patterns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our backlog figures may not accurately predict future sales.We use backlog to predict our anticipated future sales. Our year-end backlog was $55.5 million, $41.2 million, and $39.9 million at the end of fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We define “backlog” at any given point in time to consist of all firm, unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time. We expect to fill most items in backlog within the following twelve months. However, since orders may be rescheduled or canceled and a significant portion of our net sales is derived from a small number of customers, backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels. Moreover, we cannot be sure of when during the future twelve-month period we will be able to recognize revenue corresponding to our backlog nor can we be certain that revenues corresponding to our backlog will not fall into periods beyond the twelve-month horizon. There is a limited availability of sites suitable for cladding operations.Our cladding process involves the detonation of large amounts of explosives. As a result, the sites where we perform cladding must meet certain criteria, including adequate distance from densely populated areas, specific geological characteristics, and the ability to comply with local noise and vibration abatement regulations in conducting the process. Our shooting sites in Pennsylvania and in Germany are located in mines. Our Pennsylvania shooting site is subleased under an arrangement pursuant to which we provide certain contractual services to the sub-landlord, and this sublease expires in 2029. In addition, we could experience difficulty in obtaining or renewing permits because of resistance from residents in the vicinity of existing or proposed sites. The failure to obtain required governmental approvals or permits could limit our ability to expand our cladding business in the future, and the failure to maintain such permits or satisfy other conditions to use the sites would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.There is no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully against other manufacturers of competitive products.Our explosion-welded clad products compete on a worldwide basis with explosion-welded clad products made by other manufacturers in the clad metal business and with products manufactured using other technologies. We see competition from one large well-known clad supplier and from a growing number of smaller companies with explosion welded clad manufacturing capability in China and India. Explosion-welded clad products also compete with products manufactured by roll bond and weld overlay cladding processes. The technical and commercial niches of each cladding process are well understood within the industry and vary from one market location to another and at different metal prices. We focus on reliability, product quality, on-time delivery performance, and low-cost manufacturing to minimize the potential of future competitive threats. However, there is no guarantee we will be able to maintain our competitive position.21Table of ContentsCustomers have the right to change orders until products are completed.Customers have some rights to change orders after they have been placed. If orders are changed, the extra expenses associated with the change usually will be passed on to the customer. However, because a change in an order may delay completion of the project, recognition of income for the project may also be delayed. Additionally, any errors or changes as to specifications or significant changes in pricing or availability of materials may cause cost overruns and delays in completion of projects. If we fail to meet delivery schedules, we may be required to pay damages or may risk loss of an order, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We do not maintain a reserve fund for warranty or defective products claims. Our costs could substantially increase if we experience a large claim or a significant number of warranty claims.Our product warranties against technical defects of our clad products vary depending on our purchase orders with customers. The warranties require us to repair or replace defective products and may require the payment of a certain percentage of the purchase price as liquidated damages for our failure to meet the specified product specifications and delivery requirements. In addition, our clad products are often used as part of larger projects or are used in potentially hazardous applications that can cause injury or loss of life and damage to property or equipment. In the event of an actual or alleged product defect, we may be named as a defendant in product liability or other lawsuits asserting potentially large claims. We cannot guarantee that insurance will be available or adequate to cover any or all liabilities incurred. We have not established any reserve funds for potential warranty claims since historically we have experienced few warranty claims for our products and the costs associated with our warranty claims have been low. If we experience an increase in warranty claims or if our repair and replacement costs associated with warranty claims increase significantly, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Risk Factors
 Related to our Businesses GenerallyOur operations are subject to political and economic instability and risk of government actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. We are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries in which we operate. Our operations are subject to various risks unique to each country that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. With respect to any particular country, these risks may include:•political, social and economic instability; •civil unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war, other armed conflict;•public health crises and catastrophic events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; •inflation;•currency fluctuations, devaluations, conversion, or repatriation restrictions;•expropriation and nationalization of our assets;•confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies;•theft of, or lack of sufficient legal protection for, proprietary technology and other intellectual property;•limitations on extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing;•limitations on or disruptions to our markets or operations, restrictions on payments, or limitations on the movement of funds;•increased tariffs;•trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions;•unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements, including changes in interpretation or enforcement of existing laws;•deprivation of contract rights; and•the inability to obtain or retain licenses required for operation.Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by disruptions in the global and European economies caused by the ongoing military action between Russia and Ukraine.In February of 2022, Russian military forces invaded Ukraine, resulting in conflict and disruption in the region. The length, impact and outcome of the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine is highly unpredictable. This conflict has led and may continue to lead to significant market and other disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices and supply of energy resources, instability in financial markets, higher inflation, supply chain interruptions, increased costs for transportation 22Table of Contentsand raw materials, political and social instability, as well as an increase in cyberattacks and espionage. Furthermore, governments in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and others have imposed financial and economic sanctions on certain industry segments and various parties in Russia. We continue to monitor the conflict including the potential impact of financial and economic sanctions on the global economy and particularly the economies of Europe. Increased trade barriers, sanctions and other restrictions on global or regional trade could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further escalation of geopolitical tensions related to this military conflict and/or its expansion could result in loss of property, expropriation, cyberattacks, supply disruptions, plant closures and an inability to obtain key supplies and materials, as well as adversely affect both our and our customers' supply chains and logistics, particularly in Europe.In many cases, both our German operations and those of European customers and suppliers depend on the availability of natural gas for use in their manufacturing operations. A significant proportion of Germany's natural gas supply has historically originated from Russia. Material disruptions of natural gas supply to Europe and in particular Germany, whether from sanctions, counter-measures by Russia, other restrictions, damage to infrastructure and logistics or otherwise from the destabilizing effects of military conflict could materially and adversely impact European and global natural gas and oil markets. We expect that shortages in supply and increases in costs of natural gas or other energy will adversely impact our ability to operate our German manufacturing facilities as efficiently and cost-effectively as previously, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter.We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in annual and quarterly operating results caused by various factors at our businesses. At NobelClad, quarterly sales and operating results depend on the volume and timing of the orders in our backlog as well as bookings during the quarter. At DynaEnergetics, the level of demand from our customers is impacted by oil and gas prices as well as a variety of other factors and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. At Arcadia, operating results can fluctuate due to price movements in the market for raw aluminum. Portions of our operating expenses are fixed, and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts and product development programs. If sales do not meet our expectations in any given period, the adverse impact on operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust operating expenses sufficiently or quickly enough to compensate for such a shortfall. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results for any future period. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”We are exposed to potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against the currencies of many of our operating subsidiaries. Many of our operating subsidiaries conduct business in euros, Canadian dollars, or other foreign currencies. Sales made in currencies other than U.S. dollars accounted for 6%, 16%, and 17% of total sales for the years ended 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of any of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience foreign currency translation (gains) losses with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. In addition, our company and our operating subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we or they enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or their respective functional currencies. For example, DynaEnergetics Europe's functional currency is euros, but its sales often occur in U.S. dollars. Changes in exchange rates with respect to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. In addition, we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to our operating subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities and to the financial results of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in other cumulative comprehensive loss as a separate component of equity. Our primary exposure to foreign currency risk is the euro, due to the percentage of our U.S. dollar revenue that is derived from countries where the euro is the functional currency. We use foreign currency forward contracts, generally with maturities of one month, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated asset and liability account balances. These hedge transactions relate to our operating entities with significant economic exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. Our primary economic exposures include the U.S. dollar to the euro, the U.S. dollar to the Canadian dollar, and the euro to the U.S. dollar. Since the underlying balance sheet account balances being hedged can fluctuate significantly throughout our monthly hedge periods, our hedging program cannot fully protect against foreign currency fluctuations.23Table of ContentsDisruptions or delays involving our suppliers or increases in prices for the components, raw materials and parts that we obtain from our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations. Our operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the components, raw materials and parts that we need to manufacture our products. In some instances, we purchase components, raw materials and parts that are ultimately derived from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. Any number of factors, including labor disruptions, acts of war or terrorism, military activity, trade sanctions, catastrophic weather events, the occurrence of a pandemic or other widespread illness (such as COVID-19), contractual or other disputes, unfavorable economic or industry conditions, transportation disruptions, delivery delays or other performance problems or financial difficulties or solvency problems, could disrupt our suppliers’ operations and performance, which could, in turn, lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions for us and disrupt our operations. Although we have been able to manage supply chain impacts through the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced longer lead times for certain materials and have in other cases had heightened difficulty in sourcing materials. Lockdown orders or a prolonged period of travel, commercial and other similar restrictions could cause additional global supply disruptions. If we experience further supply disruptions, we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly. Any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of components, raw materials or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules or suspend production entirely, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.The terms of our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants, the breach of any of which could result in acceleration of payment of our credit facilities.As of December 31, 2022, we had an outstanding balance of $135.0 million on our syndicated credit agreement. This agreement includes various covenants and restrictions and certain of these relate to the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the mortgaging, pledging or disposing of major assets. We are also required to maintain certain financial ratios on a quarterly basis. A breach of any of these covenants could impair our ability to borrow and could result in acceleration of our obligations to repay our debt if we are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment from our lenders. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and other provisions of the credit agreement, as amended, and our other loan agreements. Any failure to remain in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our credit agreement could result in a default, which would, absent a waiver or amendment, require immediate repayment of outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities. We may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to satisfy such a repayment obligation. If our customers delay paying or fail to pay a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. We depend on a limited number of significant customers in our DynaEnergetics and NobelClad businesses, and the loss of one or more significant customers or the failure of a customer to pay outstanding amounts due could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated results of operations. In most cases, we bill our customers for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to the risk that our customers will delay payment of or fail to pay our invoices. In weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers’ cash flow from operations and in their access to the credit markets and rising interest rates. If our customers delay paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.New or existing tariffs and other trade measures could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.New or existing tariffs and other trade measures could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows, either directly or indirectly through various adverse impacts on our significant customers. In 2018, the U.S. announced tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum imported from countries where we typically source metals. These tariffs were met with retaliatory tariffs from certain countries and increased, broader tariffs were levied by the U.S. on targeted countries, including China. Certain of these tariffs have been modified; however, impacts and uncertainties are continuing. The tariffs impacted the cost of the importation of steel, which we utilize in our steel plate and steel pipe, key materials in our NobelClad and DynaEnergetics businesses. Though in many cases we have been able to source metals from domestic suppliers, some materials are only available from sources subject to tariffs. The cost of domestic steel and aluminum has also increased, along with the price of delivery, and the availability of certain materials has been limited. These increased costs have increased the price of our products to our customers and, in some instances, affected our ability to be competitive. For our NobelClad business, this impacts our ability to compete on international projects and negatively impacts U.S. fabricators, which are the primary consumers of NobelClad products. Although some of these tariffs have been subsequently 24Table of Contentsreduced or eliminated, as occurred in connection with the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA), many tariffs continue to exist and new tariffs have been and may be imposed at any time. The prolonged duration of tariffs, the imposition of additional tariffs and the risk of potential broader global trade conflicts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Failure to attract and retain key personnel and source sufficient labor could adversely affect our current operating results.Our continued success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical employees, and our ability to secure sufficient manufacturing labor. In recent months, our management team has undergone significant changes, including the announced retirement of Michael Kuta, our Chief Financial Officer, and the departure of our President and Chief Executive Officer, followed by the appointment of Michael Kuta and David Aldous as interim co-Presidents and Chief Executive Officers and the appointment of Eric Walter as Chief Financial Officer. Our current and future success is dependent on recruitment of a new Chief Executive Officer and the retention of key personnel, including other executive officers and directors. The loss or unavailability of any key personnel could have an adverse effect on the Company’s leadership, ability to execute our strategy, financial condition and results of operations.  In order to meet the needs and expectations of our customers and to achieve our growth objectives, we must attract, train, and retain a large number of hourly associates, while at the same time controlling labor costs. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training, retention and other costs. In certain areas where we operate, there is significant competition for employees, and we must ensure that we continue to offer competitive wages, benefits and workplace conditions to retain qualified employees, which increases our labor costs. A shortage of qualified candidates who meet all legal work authorization requirements, failure to hire and retain new employees in a timely manner or higher than expected turnover levels could affect our ability to meet customer demand, grow our businesses and meet our labor cost objectives and could have impacts on employee satisfaction generally. Failure to adequately monitor and proactively respond to employee dissatisfaction could lead to higher turnover, litigation and unionization efforts, which could negatively impact our ability to meet our operating results.A failure in our information technology systems or those of third parties, including those caused by security breaches, cyber-attacks or data protection failures, could disrupt our business, result in significant legal costs and other losses and damage our reputation. We are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our operations. Our information technology systems are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and banking information and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. The risk of cybersecurity incidents may increase with the political and economic instability or warfare (including the ongoing hostilities between Russia and Ukraine). Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, theft, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, a data breach could result in negative publicity which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our stock price.We outsource certain technology and business process functions to third parties and may increasingly do so in the future. If we do not effectively develop, implement and monitor our outsourcing strategy, if third party providers do not perform as anticipated or if we experience technological or other problems with a transition, we may not realize productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and loss of business. Our outsourcing of certain technology and business processes functions to third parties may expose us to enhanced risks related to data security, which could result in monetary and reputational damages. In addition, our ability to receive services from third party providers may be impacted by cultural differences, political instability, and unanticipated regulatory requirements or policies. As a result, our ability to conduct our business may be adversely affected.25Table of ContentsFailure to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting could result in the inability to report our financial results in a timely and reliable manner, which could harm our business and impact the value of our securities.We depend on our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements in order to run our business. If we fail to do so, our business could be negatively affected and our independent registered public accounting firm may be unable to attest to the fair presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be harmed. Even effective internal controls have inherent limitations including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or a deterioration in the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures.If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls, including any failure to implement new or improved controls as may be required by acquisitions or other changes in our business, or if we experience difficulties in their execution, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In the event that our current internal control practices deteriorate, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and investor confidence and the market price of our stock may be adversely affected.Legal and Regulatory RisksOur operations require us to comply with numerous laws and regulations, violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.Our operations are subject to international, regional, national, and local laws and regulations in every place where we operate, relating to matters such as environmental protection, health and safety, labor and employment, import/export controls, currency exchange, bribery and corruption, data privacy and cybersecurity, intellectual property, immigration, and taxation. These laws and regulations are complex, frequently change, and have tended to become more stringent over time. In the event the scope of these laws and regulations expands in the future, the incremental cost of compliance could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations, or consolidated cash flows.Our international operations are subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations, such as the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other similar laws. We are also subject to trade control regulations and trade sanctions laws that restrict the movement of certain goods to, and certain operations in, various countries or with certain persons. These trade regulations and laws can include restrictions on selling or importing goods, services or technology in or from affected regions, travel bans and asset freezes impacting connected individuals and political, military, business and financial organizations and can change very quickly, such as has occurred in connection with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Our ability to transfer people, products and data among certain countries is subject to maintaining required licenses and complying with these laws and regulations.The internal controls, policies and procedures, and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or from material violations of applicable laws and regulations. Any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of anti-bribery, trade control, trade sanctions or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Violations of international and U.S. laws and regulations or the loss of any required licenses may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies or restrictions on business conduct, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. In addition, any major violations could have a significant effect on our reputation and consequently on our ability to win future business and maintain existing customer and supplier relationships.The use of explosives in our DynaEnergetics and NobelClad manufacturing processes and products subject us to additional environmental, health and safety laws and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities.DynaEnergetics uses explosive materials in its manufacturing processes and products. NobelClad’s manufacturing process involves the detonation of large quantities of explosives. The use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity. These activities subject us to extensive environmental and health and safety laws and regulations including guidelines and regulations for the purchase, manufacture, handling, transport, storage and use of explosives issued by the U.S. Bureau of 26Table of ContentsAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety regulations set forth by the U.S. Department of Transportation; the Safety Library Publications of the Institute of Makers of Explosive; and similar guidelines of their European counterparts. In Germany, the transport, storage and use of explosives is governed by a permit issued under the Explosives Act (Sprengstoffgesetz). Despite our use of specialized facilities to store and handle dangerous materials and our employee training programs, the storage and handling of explosive materials could result in explosive incidents that temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupt our or our customers’ operations or cause restrictions, delays or cancellations in the delivery of our services. It is possible that such an explosion could result in death or significant injuries to employees and other persons. Material property damage to us, our customers and third parties arising from an explosion or resulting fire could also occur. Any explosion could expose us to adverse publicity and liability for damages or cause production restrictions, delays or cancellations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable requirements or the occurrence of an explosive incident may also result in the loss of our license to store and handle explosives, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions.Demand for our products could be reduced by existing and future legislation, regulations and public sentiment. Regulatory agencies and environmental advocacy groups in the United States, the E.U., and other regions or countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their role in climate change. There is also increased focus, including by governments and our customers, investors and other stakeholders, on these and other sustainability and energy transition matters. Existing or future legislation and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, as well as initiatives by governments, non-governmental organizations, and companies to conserve energy or promote the use of alternative energy sources, and negative attitudes toward or perceptions of fossil fuel products and their relationship to the environment, may significantly curtail demand for and production of oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and thus reduce future demand for some of our products. In addition, some international, national, state and local governments and agencies have also adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on directly limiting the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing. These laws and regulations could limit oil and gas development, lead to operational delays and increased costs for our customers, and therefore reduce demand for our products. Such reductions in demand for our products may, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Increased negative investor sentiment toward oil and gas and preference for assets outside of traditional energy sectors could lead to higher capital costs for our customers and reduced investment in fossil fuels, thereby reducing demand for our products. Such preferences could also impact our ability to obtain acceptable debt or equity financing on attractive terms or at all and could negatively impact our stock price over time. Our business, reputation and demand for our stock could be negatively affected if we do not (or are perceived to not) act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters.We are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. We are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulation in the United States and the other countries where our manufacturing facilities are located. Among other things, these laws regulate the emissions or discharge of materials into the environment; govern the use, storage, treatment, disposal and management of hazardous substances and wastes; protect the health and safety of our employees; regulate the materials used in our products or manufacturing processes; and impose liability for the costs of investigating and remediating (as well as other damages resulting from) present and past releases of hazardous substances. Representative laws and regulations which we may be subject to the in the U.S. include: noise abatement and air emissions regulations, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state laws, and various regulations and laws enforced by the U.S Department of Labor, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and their state equivalents. Violations of these laws or of any conditions contained in environmental permits can result in substantial fines or penalties, injunctive relief, requirements to install pollution controls or other equipment, and civil sanctions. We could be held liable for costs to investigate, remediate or otherwise address contamination at any real property we have ever owned, operated or used as a disposal site, or at other sites where we or predecessors may have released hazardous materials. We could incur fines, penalties or sanctions or be subject to third-party claims, including indemnification claims, for property damage, personal injury or otherwise as a result of violations of (or liabilities under) environmental, health and safety laws, or in connection with releases of hazardous or other materials.27Table of ContentsChanges in or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or enforcement policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of other environmental liabilities or obligations in the future including additional investigation, remediation or other obligations with respect to our products or business activities may lead to additional compliance costs or require us to change our manufacturing processes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.In Germany, we and all our activities are subject to various safety and environmental regulations of the federal state which are enforced by the local authorities, including the Federal Act on Emission Control (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz). The Federal Act on Emission Control permits are held by companies jointly owned by DynaEnergetics and the other companies that are located at the Troisdorf manufacturing site and are for an indefinite period of time. The Dillenburg, Germany facility is operated based on a specific permit granted by the local mountain authority and must be renewed every three years. Any failure to comply with current and future environmental and safety regulations could subject us to significant liabilities. Any actual or alleged violations of environmental, health or safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities or substantial civil or criminal sanctions. In addition, under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our facilities and at third party waste disposal sites, even when such contamination was caused by a predecessor and even when the actions resulting in the contamination were lawful at the time. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage. Failure to comply with applicable federal, state and local employment and labor laws and regulations could have a material, adverse impact on our business. Various federal, state and local employment and labor laws and regulations govern our relationships with our employees, and similar laws and regulations apply to our operations outside of the U.S. These laws and regulations relate to matters such as employment discrimination, wage and hour laws, requirements to provide and document meal and rest periods or other benefits, family leave mandates, requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements, insurance and workers’ compensation rules, healthcare laws and anti-discrimination and anti-harassment laws. We incur substantial costs to comply with these laws and regulations and non-compliance could expose us to significant liabilities. For example, Arcadia is currently defending a lawsuit in California alleging violations of wage and hour regulations with respect to certain temporary and permanent employees. We are incurring legal costs to defend this action and may in the future be required to defend similar actions, and we could incur losses from these and similar cases, and the amount of such losses or costs could be material. Several jurisdictions also have implemented sick pay and paid time off legislation, which requires employers to provide paid time off to employees, and “just cause” termination legislation, which restricts companies’ ability to terminate employees or reduce employees’ hours unless they can prove “just cause” or a “bona fide economic reason” for the termination or reduction in hours. All of these regulations impose additional obligations on us and our failure to comply with any of these regulations could subject us to penalties and other legal liabilities, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  The regulatory environment governing information, data security and privacy is increasingly demanding and evolving and a data security breach could result in litigation, enforcement actions and related penalties and fines.The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. We are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state laws and non-U.S. laws and regulations governing the protection of personal and confidential information of our customers and employees. The regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future.Several U.S. states have passed comprehensive privacy laws that will go into effect in 2023. Of note among them is the California Consumer Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which amends and expands the California Consumer Privacy (CCPA). The CPRA, which went into effect on January 1, 2023, along with the CCPA, governs the transmission, security and privacy of California residents’ personal information. The CPRA has a twelve month look-back period for enforcement purposes. Among many new requirements, the CPRA creates a category for sensitive data including health and other personal information that requires additional safeguards and disclosures. In addition, the CPRA expands consumers’ rights and has enhanced enforcement mechanisms such as the creation of a California Privacy Protection Agency that will investigate and enforce the CPRA and its promulgating regulations. The states of Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut and Utah have also recently enacted omnibus data privacy laws.  In addition, many other proposals exist in states across the U.S. that could increase our potential liability and increase our compliance costs. Aspects of these state privacy statutes remain unclear, resulting in further legal uncertainty and potentially requiring us to modify our data practices and policies and to incur substantial additional compliance costs.28Table of ContentsMoreover, a comprehensive federal data privacy bill, the American Data Privacy and Protection Act, has been proposed and, if passed, will further change the privacy and data security compliance landscape. In addition, the SEC recently proposed a cybersecurity rule that may go into effect as early as the first half of 2023. The new cybersecurity rule will require, among other things, comprehensive disclosure regarding oversight of cybersecurity risks and increased monitoring and reporting of data security incidents.Internationally, the European Data Protection Board recently released new guidelines on enforcement and fines related to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The new guidelines suggest a tougher stance on enforcement and stiffer fines for companies that violate the GDPR. This is in addition to the continued complexities involving the transfer of personal data from Europe to the U.S. following the Schrems II decision. The U.S. and the European Commission have been in discussions for a new Trans-Atlantic data privacy framework, Privacy Shield 2.0, which is anticipated to go into effect in early 2023, which will require additional compliance efforts from our company. In March 2022, the U.S. and EU announced a new regulatory regime intended to replace the invalidated regulations; however, this new EU-US Data Privacy Framework has not yet been implemented beyond an executive order signed by President Biden on October 7, 2022 on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities.As international data privacy and protection laws continue to evolve, and as new regulations, interpretive guidance and enforcement information become available, we may incur incremental costs to modify our business practices to comply with these requirements. In addition, our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless, intentional or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents.Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could subject us to criminal or civil, monetary or and non-monetary penalties, disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction, subject us to class action lawsuits and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, including proposals to restrict emissions of GHGs and other sustainability initiatives, could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business and results of operations.Various legislative, regulatory, and inter-governmental proposals to restrict emissions of GHGs, such as carbon dioxide (“CO2”), are under consideration by governmental legislative bodies and regulators in the jurisdictions where we operate.  Such regulatory and global initiatives may require us to modify our operating procedures, incur capital expenditures, change fuel sources, or take other actions that may adversely affect our financial results. Increasing regulations to reduce GHG emissions, as proposed throughout many of our operating regions, would be expected to increase energy costs, reduce energy availability and increase price volatility for energy.The heightened stakeholder focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance, or “ESG,” issues related to our businesses requires the continuous monitoring of various and evolving laws, regulations, standards and expectations and the associated reporting requirements. Specifically, certain stakeholders are beginning to require that we provide information on our plans relating to certain climate-related matters such as greenhouse gas emissions, and we expect this trend to continue and be amplified by the potential adoption of the proposed SEC regulations relating to climate change disclosure.  A failure to adequately or timely meet stakeholder expectations and reporting requirements may result in noncompliance with any imposed regulations, the loss of business, reputational impacts, diluted market valuation, an inability to attract and retain customers, and an inability to attract and retain top talent.  In addition, our adoption and the reporting of certain standards or mandated compliance to certain requirements could necessitate additional investments that could impact our profitability. Further, we have established and publicly disclosed other ESG targets and goals and other sustainability commitments that are subject to a variety of assumptions, risks and uncertainties. If we are unable to meet these targets, goals or commitments on our projected timelines or at all, or if they are not perceived to be sufficiently robust, our reputation as well as our relationships with investors, customers and other stakeholders could be harmed, which could in turn adversely impact our business and results of operations. In addition, not all of our competitors may seek to establish climate or other ESG targets and goals, or at a comparable level to ours, which could result in our competitors achieving competitive advantages through lower supply chain or operating costs.29Table of ContentsChanges in or interpretation of tax law could impact the determination of our income tax liabilities for a tax year.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is subjective or uncertain. We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S and have significant intercompany transactions between our affiliates. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or disputes about intercompany transfer pricing arrangements may result in higher effective tax rates for the Company. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or their interpretation, both domestically and internationally. For example, regulations related to the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) are still being developed, some with retroactive application. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to tax law, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial condition or results of operations. The OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project (or BEPS Project) is developing an international framework to combat tax avoidance by multinational enterprises and countries where the Company is subject to taxes are independently evaluating their corporate tax policy. Tax legislation and enforcement could adversely impact the Company’s tax provision and the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities. We are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions from time to time. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. The final resolution of any audits or litigation may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made.We are subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future. We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to litigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings with other parties. Managing or defending such legal proceedings may result in substantial legal fees, expenses and costs and diversion of management resources. If material litigation is brought against us in the future, an adverse decision could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. For a more detailed discussion of pending litigation, refer to Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event of a dispute arising in connection with our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels, or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. Our inability to enforce our rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.Intellectual Property RisksOur failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position. The protection of our intellectual property rights is essential to maintaining our competitive position and recognizing the value of our investments in technology and intellectual property in our existing and future products. We rely on trade secret protection for certain aspects of our technology, in part through confidentiality and other written agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties. Through these and other written agreements, we attempt to control access to and distribution of our intellectual property documentation and other proprietary technology information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, former employees, consultants or third parties may, in an unauthorized manner, attempt to use, copy or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property rights or technology or otherwise develop a product with the same functionality as our technology. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights is difficult, and nearly impossible on a worldwide basis. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property rights.We also actively pursue patent protection for our proprietary technology and intellectual property where appropriate for protecting our competitive position. The process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and we cannot be certain that any currently pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents, or that, even if patents are issued, they will be respected by third parties. In addition, our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is 30Table of Contentssimilar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets, and this could have a similar effect on our competitive position.Intellectual property litigation and threats of litigation are becoming more common in the oilfield services industry. We are currently involved and may in the future be involved in litigation, in the United States or abroad, to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to protect our trade secrets and know-how. These actions can require multiple years to come to resolution or settlement, and even if we ultimately prevail, we may be unable to realize adequate protection of our competitive position. In addition, these actions commonly result in actions by the affected third parties to establish the invalidity of our patents. While we intend to prosecute these actions vigorously, there is no guarantee of success, and such effort takes significant financial and management resources from the Company. In the event that one or more of our patents are challenged, a court or the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) may invalidate the patent(s) or determine that the patent(s) is not enforceable, which could harm our competitive position. If our patents are invalidated, or if the scope of the claims in any of these patents is limited by a court or USPTO decision, we could be prevented from pursuing certain litigation matters or licensing the invalidated or limited portion of such patents. Such adverse decisions could negatively impact our future revenue. Patent litigation, if necessary or when instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources.We may incur substantial costs defending against third parties alleging that we infringe their proprietary rights.We are currently involved and may in the future be involved in litigation relating to alleged infringement by us of others’ patents or other intellectual property rights. We have an active ""freedom to operate"" review process for our technology, but there is no assurance that future infringement claims will not be asserted. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core businesses even if we are ultimately successful. In the event of any adverse ruling in any intellectual property litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacturing, use and sale of infringing products, discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain a license from the third-party claiming infringement with royalty payment obligations by us. We also have certain indemnification obligations to customers with respect to the infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products, which may increase our costs. Any of these occurrences could significantly harm our competitive position, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Risks Related to AcquisitionsWe have incurred debt to finance the acquisition of 60% of Arcadia and will incur additional substantial financial obligations in connection with the acquisition of the remaining 40% of Arcadia.We financed a portion of the purchase price of the Arcadia acquisition with proceeds from our credit facility. Our ability to service the indebtedness under the credit facility and to maintain compliance with the covenants included in the credit facility will depend on our success in achieving the intended benefits of the acquisition, which is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as discussed above. We will have to devote a substantial portion of our cash flow to meet required payments of principal and interest on this indebtedness, and if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to do so, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the terms of the credit facility, we could be in default under the agreement. In addition, as early as three years after the closing of the Arcadia acquisition, we may be required to pay the Option Purchase Price for some or all of Munera’s interests in Arcadia if Munera exercises the Put Option. Even if we elect to pay 80% of the Option Purchase Price in preferred stock, we will need to fund the remaining portion in cash. We do not currently have sufficient funds to pay the cash portion of the Option Purchase Price, and we may not be able to obtain such funds on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our ability to finance the Option Purchase Price will depend on numerous factors, including the performance of our businesses and general market and economic conditions. If we fail to pay the Option Purchase Price when required under the Operating Agreement, we will be in default under the agreement. The Option Purchase Price is likely to be substantial relative to the current size of our business. In addition, the Option Purchase Price is subject to a defined “floor” value in the Operating Agreement, which is based primarily upon a contractually stated equity value. The floor value will apply even if Arcadia’s performance fails to meet our expectations. This may make it more difficult for us to finance the payment of the Option Purchase Price. In addition, debt or preferred equity financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include liens or restrictions on our assets and covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as paying dividends or making distributions, incurring additional debt, acquiring or disposing of assets or increasing expenses. Debt financing would also be required to be repaid regardless of our operating results. Obtaining financing through issuances of common stock would impose fewer restrictions on our future operations but would be dilutive to the interests of existing stockholders.31Table of ContentsAfter the Arcadia acquisition, DMC is the majority shareholder of Arcadia, and our interest in Arcadia is subject to the risks normally associated with the conduct of businesses with a minority shareholder.Pursuant to the Equity Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we acquired a 60% ownership stake in Arcadia, Munera continues to hold 40% of the outstanding equity interests of Arcadia.  Our Operating Agreement governs our relationship with Munera, and we believe the Operating Agreement provides us with effective and sufficient control of Arcadia to allow the business to be operated consistent with our goals and values and with sufficient opportunity for profitable growth. Nevertheless, conducting a business with minority owners may lead to certain risks and uncertainties, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to profitably grow the Arcadia business, which could have a material adverse impact on our future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition. These include:•our ability to effectively control certain strategic, operational and financial decisions;•the potential for disagreement over the direction of the company and costs and expenses involved; and•the risk of having economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with, or opposed to, those of Munera.There can be no assurance that the acquisition will be beneficial to us, whether due to the above-described risks, unfavorable economic conditions, integration challenges or other factors.Fully integrating Arcadia’s business following the acquisition may be more difficult, costly and time-consuming than expected, which may adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our common stock.While the Company’s management has made significant progress in integrating Arcadia’s business into DMC, integration efforts will be substantial and continuing. The integration process is complex, costly and time-consuming, and the Company’s management may face significant, ongoing challenges in implementing such integration, many of which may be beyond the control of management, including, without limitation:•difficulties in achieving anticipated expansion and growth prospects;•the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process;•unanticipated issues in integrating accounting, information technology, communications programs, financial procedures and operations, and other systems, procedures and policies;•cybersecurity issues as we integrate Arcadia into our programs and systems;•failure to implement effective internal and disclosure controls;•difficulties in managing a larger corporation, addressing differences in business culture and retaining key personnel;•impacts on employee, supplier and customer relationships;•failure to address any pre-existing liabilities or claims involving the acquired business;•unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;•coordinating geographically separate organizations; and•unforeseen expenses or delays associated with integration efforts.Some of these factors are outside the control of the Company, and any one of them could result in increased costs and diversion of management’s time and energy, as well as decreases in revenue or increases in cost, which could materially impact the business, financial conditions and results of operations of the Company. The acquisition of Arcadia is expected to materially complicate the timely achievement of effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price. Prior to the acquisition, Arcadia operated as a closely-held, private company, which had no previous public reporting obligations and therefore, did not historically institute and evaluate its internal controls and procedures in compliance with Section 404. Implementing changes to our internal controls have been required following the acquisition and may take significant additional time to complete, and may require further significant effort and involvement of directors, officers and employees, as well as substantial costs in order to modify existing accounting systems. Further, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the internal controls, disclosure controls and information technology infrastructure of the Company and Arcadia. Our efforts to assimilate and integrate our internal controls with Arcadia’s may not be effective, and any failure to maintain effective controls could result in material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements or otherwise cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. This, in turn, could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and our stock price, and could result in stockholder litigation. 32Table of ContentsTo the extent that we seek to further expand our business through acquisitions, we may experience issues in executing acquisitions or integrating acquired operations. From time to time, we examine opportunities to make selective acquisitions in order to increase shareholder return by increasing our total available markets, expanding our existing operations and, potentially, generating synergies. The success of any acquisition depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: •identifying suitable candidates for acquisition and negotiating acceptable terms; •obtaining approval from regulatory authorities and potentially DMC’s shareholders; •maintaining our financial and strategic focus and avoiding distraction of management during the process of integrating the acquired business; •implementing our standards, controls, procedures and policies at the acquired business and addressing any pre-existing liabilities or claims involving the acquired business; •our ability to realize the expected tax treatment or tax benefits from the transaction; and •to the extent the acquired operations are in a country in which we have not operated historically, understanding the regulations and challenges of operating in that new jurisdiction.For example, our due diligence process may not reveal all liabilities associated with a potential acquisition, and this could result in us incurring unanticipated losses after the acquisition is completed. There can be no assurance that we will be able to conclude any acquisitions successfully or that any acquisition will achieve the anticipated synergies or other positive results. Any material problems that we encounter in connection with such an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Risk Factors
 Related to Our Common StockThe price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile, which may make it difficult for you to resell the common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive. The market price and trading volume of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations due to general stock market conditions and/or a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations, business prospects or liquidity. Among the factors that could affect the price of our common stock are: •changes in the architectural building products, oil and gas, industrial, or infrastructure markets; •operating and financial performance that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts or investors; •developments in our business or in our business sectors generally; •regulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations; •the operating and stock price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;•announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors;•our ability to integrate and operate the companies and the businesses that we acquire; •rumors and market speculation regarding our industries, business or trading activity;•significant amounts of short selling, the perception that short sales could occur and other speculative trading activity; •activism by any large stockholder or group of stockholders;•changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, including volatility in foreign exchange rates, tariffs and stock, commodity, credit or asset valuations, and government actions or shutdowns.The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has at times been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies, and these fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.Holders of our common stock do not currently receive dividends and our dividend may not be reinstated in the future.   Our Board of Directors suspended our dividend in April 2020 in order to preserve liquidity in light of the sharp reduction in demand for DynaEnergetics products and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors declares out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. In addition, dividends may not be permitted pursuant to the terms of debt or other agreements to which we are subject. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our 33Table of Contentscommon stock, we are not required to do so and there can be no assurance as to whether the Board will reinstate a dividend in the future"

Please carefully consider the following discussion of material factors, events, and uncertainties that make our business and an investment in our securities subject to risk. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations.Summary of Material Risk Factors
The following is a summary of the material risk factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations:Risk Factors
 Related to Arcadia•North American and global economic and industry-related business conditions materially affect our sales and results of operations.•An inability to successfully develop new products or improve existing products could negatively impact our ability to attract new customers and/or retain existing customers.•If we are unable to manage our supply chain effectively, including availability and price of materials used in our products, our results of operations will be negatively affected.•Product quality issues and product liability claims could adversely affect our operating results.Risk Factors
 Related to DynaEnergetics•Demand for DynaEnergetics’ products is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry. Decreases or expected decreases in oil and gas prices and reduced expenditures in the oil and gas industry could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.•Failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customers demand could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.•Failure to manage periods of growth or contraction may seriously harm our business.•We may not be able to continue to compete successfully against other companies in our industry.•If we are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, and technology trends, our business and consolidated results of operations and the value of our intellectual property could be materially and adversely affected. •Demand for DynaEnergetics products could be reduced by existing and future legislation, regulations and public sentiment.Risk Factors
 Related to NobelClad•NobelClad’s business is dependent on sales to a limited number of customers in cyclical markets and our results are affected by the price of metals.•We are dependent on a relatively small number of large projects and customers for a significant portion of our net sales.•Our backlog figures may not accurately predict future sales.•There is a limited availability of sites suitable for cladding operations.•There is no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully against other manufacturers of competitive products.•Customers have the right to change orders until products are completed.•We do not maintain a reserve fund for warranty or defective products claims. Our costs could substantially increase if we experience a large claim or a significant number of warranty claims.Risk Factors
 Related to our Businesses Generally14Table of Contents•The COVID-19 pandemic and related economic impacts have had, and are likely to continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.•Our operations are subject to political and economic instability and risk of government actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. •Our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter.•We are exposed to potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against the currencies of many of our operating subsidiaries. •Disruptions or delays involving our suppliers or increases in prices for the components, raw materials and parts that we obtain from our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations.•The terms of our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants, the breach of any of which could result in acceleration of payment of our credit facilities.•If our customers delay paying or fail to pay a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. •Tariffs imposed by the U.S. government and related counter tariffs have increased our costs, limited the availability of metals and may lead to further trade conflicts.•Failure to attract and retain key personnel and source sufficient labor could adversely affect our current operating results.•A failure in our information technology systems or those of third parties, including those caused by security breaches, cyber-attacks or data protection failures, could disrupt our business, damage our reputation, result in litigation or enforcement action, and cause losses. •If we fail to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results in a timely and reliable manner, which could harm our business and impact the value of our securities.•We are subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future. Legal and Regulatory Risks•Our operations require us to comply with numerous laws and regulations, violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition or cash flows.•The use of explosives in our DynaEnergetics and NobelClad manufacturing processes and products subject us to additional environmental, health and safety laws and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities.•Demand for our products could be reduced by existing and future legislation, regulations and public sentiment. •We are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. •Changes in or interpretation of tax law control could impact the determination of our income tax liabilities for a tax year.Intellectual Property Risks•Our failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position. •We may incur substantial costs defending against third parties alleging that we infringe their proprietary rights.Risks Related to Acquisitions•The acquisition of Arcadia may not achieve its intended results and may result in us assuming unanticipated liabilities.•We have and will incur substantial financial obligations in connection with the Acquisition.•After the Arcadia acquisition, DMC is the majority shareholder of Arcadia, and our interest in Arcadia is subject to the risks normally associated with the conduct of businesses with a minority shareholder.•Fully integrating Arcadia’s business following the acquisition may be more difficult, costly and time-consuming than expected, which may adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our Common Stock.•The acquisition of Arcadia is expected to materially complicate the timely achievement of effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.•To the extent that we seek to further expand our business through acquisitions, we may experience issues in executing acquisitions or integrating acquired operations.Risk Factors
 Related to Our Common Stock15Table of Contents•The price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile, which may make it difficult for you to resell the common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive. •Holders of our common stock do not currently receive dividends and our dividend may not be reinstated in the future.Risk Factors
 Related to ArcadiaNorth American and global economic and industry-related business conditions materially affect our sales and results of operationsOur Arcadia businesses are significantly influenced by North American economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the North American commercial and residential construction industry. The construction industry is impacted by macroeconomic trends, such as availability of credit, employment levels, consumer confidence, interest rates and commodity prices. In addition, changes in architectural design trends, demographic trends, and/or remote work trends could negatively impact demand for our products. To the extent changes in these factors negatively impact the overall commercial construction industry, our revenue and profits could be significantly reduced. The markets in which Arcadia operates are highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and better capitalized than we are. These competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within the industries and markets in which we operate and may have significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we have. Moreover, barriers to entry are low in certain product lines and new competitors may enter our industry, whether within the U.S. or internationally. An increase in competition, including in the form of aggressive pricing by new market entrants or offerings of alternative building materials, could cause us to lose customers and lead to decreases in net sales and profitability if we are not able to respond adequately to such challenges. The actions of our existing competitors or new competitors could result in loss of customers and/or market share. Changes in our competitors' products, prices or services could negatively impact our market share, net sales and/or margins.An inability to successfully develop new products or improve existing products could negatively impact our ability to attract new customers and/or retain existing customers.Our success depends on meeting consumer needs and anticipating changes in consumer preferences with successful new products and product improvements. We aim to introduce products and new or improved production processes proactively to offset obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products. While we devote significant focus to the development of new products, we may not be successful in product development and our new products may not be commercially successful. In addition, it is possible that competitors may improve their products more rapidly or effectively, which could adversely affect our sales. Furthermore, market demand may decline as a result of consumer preferences trending away from our categories or trending down within our brands or product categories, which could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.If we are unable to manage our supply chain effectively, including availability and price of materials used in our products, our results of operations will be negatively affectedWe obtain a significant portion of our key raw materials, such as aluminum extrusions, from a few key suppliers. While we structure many of our supply arrangements to moderate the effects of fluctuations in the market for raw aluminum and we endeavor to adjust our pricing to offset potential impacts, operating results could be negatively impacted by price movements in the market for raw aluminum. In recent years, and particularly in the past year, we have seen increased volatility in the price of aluminum that we purchase from our key suppliers. Our suppliers are subject to the fluctuations in general economic cycles. Global economic conditions may impact their ability to operate their businesses, including recent impacts from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions. Our suppliers may also be impacted by the increasing costs or availability of raw materials, labor and transportation. Some of our suppliers may not be able to handle commodity cost volatility or changing volumes while still performing up to our specifications. These factors may cause suppliers to be unable to meet their commitments or to negatively change the terms of the supply arrangements.The loss of, or substantial decrease in the availability of, products from our suppliers, or the loss of a key supplier, could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. If any of our key suppliers are unable to meet their commitments, or if those supply arrangements are terminated, we may not be able to obtain certain raw materials on 16Table of Contentscommercially reasonable terms or at all, and may suffer a significant interruption in our ability to manufacture our products, including because it may be difficult to find substitute or alternate suppliers as the aluminum extrusions we use are customized. We could also be required to maintain higher inventory levels as we address supply uncertainties. Such developments would result in higher costs and ultimately a decrease in our revenues and profitability. If our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our delivery times are extended, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Product quality issues and product liability claims could adversely affect our operating resultsWe believe that future orders of our products will depend on our ability to maintain the performance, reliability, quality and timely delivery standards required by our customers. We have in the past been and currently are subject to product liability and warranty claims. If our products have performance, reliability or quality problems, or products are installed improperly, we may experience additional warranty expense; reduced or canceled orders; or delays in the collection of accounts receivable. Additionally, product liability and warranty claims could result in costly and time-consuming litigation that could require significant time and attention of management and involve significant monetary damages that could negatively impact our operating results. There is no assurance that the number and value of product liability and warranty claims will not increase as compared to historical claim rates, or that our warranty reserve at any particular time will be sufficient. No assurance can be given that coverage under insurance policies, if applicable, will be adequate to cover future product liability claims against us. If we are unable to recover on an insurance claims, in whole or in part, or if we exhaust our available insurance coverage at some point in the future, then we might be forced to expend legal fees and settlement or judgment costs relating to product liability and warrant claims, which could negatively impact our profitability, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Risk Factors
 Related to DynaEnergeticsDemand for DynaEnergetics’ products is substantially dependent on the levels of capital expenditures by the oil and gas industry. Decreases or expected decreases in oil and gas prices and reduced expenditures in the oil and gas industry could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Demand for the majority of our products depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry’s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. Higher oil and gas prices have resulted in increasing North American completion activity and increased expenditures by the oil and gas industry. This has resulted in increased cash flows for E&P companies; however, E&P companies are still seeking to control their cost of operations and this has continued to result in downward pressure on prices for our products. In addition, the oil and gas industry has historically been cyclical, and higher oil prices could reverse at any time. If this occurs, we would expect an increased risk of reduced or delayed oil and gas exploration and production spending, project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us, all of which could result in reduced demand for our products, downward pressure on selling prices for our products and decreased revenues and profits. These effects would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and can be affected by a variety of factors, including:  •changes in the supply of and demand for hydrocarbons, which are affected by general economic, business and regulatory conditions;•the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and other oil producing companies to set and maintain production levels for oil;•oil and gas production levels in the U.S. and in other non-OPEC countries;•the level of excess production capacity;•speculation as to the future price of oil and the speculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts;•government initiatives to restrict oil and gas drilling or development or promote the use of renewable energy sources and public sentiment regarding the same;•political and economic uncertainty, geopolitical unrest, and acts of war;•the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and production activity;•access to potential resources;•changes in governmental policies, subsidies, or sanctions;•the costs of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;17Table of Contents•technological advances affecting energy consumption; and•weather conditions.Continued or worsening conditions in the oil and gas industry generally may have a further material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.Failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customer demands could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing, internal fabrication utilization and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customer requirements. Factors that can impact our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements include the short-term nature of many customers’ commitments, our customers’ ability to reschedule, cancel and modify orders with little or no notice and without significant penalty, the accuracy of our customers’ forecasts, and seasonal or cyclical trends in customers' industries. To ensure availability of our products, particularly for our largest customers, we may start manufacturing our relevant products based on our customers’ forecasts, which are not binding. As a result, we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales that may never materialize or which may be substantially lower than expected. If actual demand for our products is lower than forecast, we may also experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and product obsolescence. Because certain of our sales, research and development, and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income. Conversely, customers often require rapid increases in production on short notice. We may be unable to secure sufficient materials or contract manufacturing capacity to meet such increases in demand. This could damage our customer relationships, reduce revenue growth and margins, subject us to additional liabilities, harm our reputation, and prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities.Failure to manage periods of growth or contraction may seriously harm our business.Our industry frequently sees periods of expansion and contraction which require companies to adjust to customers’ needs and market demands. We regularly contend with these issues and must carefully manage our business to meet customer and market requirements. If we fail to manage these growth and contraction decisions effectively, we may find ourselves with either excess or insufficient resources and our business and our profitability could suffer as a result.Periods of contraction or reduced net sales, or other factors negatively affecting particular markets, require us to assess whether facilities remain viable, whether staffing levels need to be reduced, and how to respond to changing levels of customer demand. While maintaining excess capacity or higher levels of employment entails short-term costs, reductions in capacity or employment could impair our ability to respond to new opportunities and programs, market improvements or to maintain customer relationships. Our decisions to reduce costs and capacity can affect our short-term and long-term results and result in restructuring charges.Expansions, including the transfer of operations to other facilities or the construction of new manufacturing facilities, include the risk of additional costs and start-up inefficiencies. If we are unable to effectively manage our expansion projects or related anticipated net sales are not realized, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.We may not be able to continue to compete successfully against other companies in our industry.The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. DynaEnergetics competes with a broad spectrum of companies that produce and market perforating services and products. Many of these companies are large national and multi-national companies, including the oil and natural gas industry’s largest oilfield service providers. These companies have longer operating histories, greater financial, technical, and other resources, and greater name recognition than we do. In addition, we compete with many smaller companies capable of competing effectively on a regional or local basis. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. To remain competitive, DynaEnergetics must continue to provide innovative products at competitive prices and maintain an excellent reputation for value, quality, on-time delivery, and safety. If we fail to compete successfully against our competition, we may be unable to maintain acceptable sales levels, prices and margins for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.18Table of ContentsIf we are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, and technology trends, our business and consolidated results of operations and the value of our intellectual property could be materially and adversely affected. The market for our products is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better and more reliable performance and enhanced product offerings. If we are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, and technology trends, our business and consolidated results of operations and the value of our intellectual property could be materially and adversely affected. Likewise, if our proprietary technologies, equipment, facilities, or work processes become obsolete, we may no longer be competitive, and our business and consolidated results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Demand for DynaEnergetics products could be reduced by existing and future legislation, regulations and public sentiment. Regulatory agencies and environmental advocacy groups in the United States, the E.U., and other regions or countries have been focusing considerable attention on emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their role in climate change. There is also increased focus, including by governments and our customers, investors and other stakeholders, on these and other sustainability and energy transition matters. Existing or future legislation and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, as well as initiatives by governments, non-governmental organizations, and companies to conserve energy or promote the use of alternative energy sources, and negative attitudes toward or perceptions of fossil fuel products and their relationship to the environment, may significantly curtail demand for and production of oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and thus reduce future demand for DynaEnergetics products. In addition, some international, national, state and local governments and agencies have also adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on directly limiting the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing. These laws and regulations could limit oil and gas development, lead to operational delays and increased costs for our customers, and therefore reduce demand for DynaEnergetics' products. Such reductions in demand for our products may, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Increased negative investor sentiment toward oil and gas and preference for assets outside of traditional energy sectors could lead to higher capital costs for our customers and reduced investment in fossil fuels, thereby reducing demand for our products. Such preferences could also impact our ability to obtain acceptable debt or equity financing on attractive terms or at all and could negatively impact our stock price over time. Our business, reputation and demand for our stock could be negatively affected if we do not (or are perceived to not) act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters.Risk Factors
 Related to NobelCladNobelClad’s business is dependent on sales to a limited number of customers in cyclical markets and our results are affected by the price of metals. NobelClad revenues are affected both by the demand for NobelClad’s explosion-welded cladding services and the base price of metal used in explosion-welded cladding operations. The explosion-welded cladding market is dependent upon sales of products for use by customers in a limited number of heavy industries, including oil and gas, chemicals and petrochemicals, alternative energy, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, rail car manufacturing, power generation, and industrial refrigeration. These industries tend to be cyclical in nature and an economic slowdown in one or all of these industries-whether due to traditional cyclicality, general economic conditions or other factors-could impact capital expenditures within that industry. The COVID pandemic, government actions taken in response, and resulting economic impacts  have created a great deal of uncertainty in our end markets and we have seen continued delays in projects and capital expenditures. In addition, metals prices affect the demand for cladded products and our margins. Although higher metal prices increase demand for use of cladded materials over solid metals, lead to higher sales (in terms of dollars rather than square meters of cladding) and generally higher margins for NobelClad, metal pricing is volatile. We have  recently experienced several years of a low-metals-price environment, which significantly reduced demand for clad product and overall sales. In the last two years, the price of metals has increased substantially, there can be no assurance that prices will maintain at these levels and supply chain difficulties and other uncertainties have disrupted projects and normal sales cycles. If demand or metals prices decline or if supply chain issues or similar disruptions persist, our sales would be adversely affected, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We are dependent on a relatively small number of large projects and customers for a significant portion of our net sales.19Table of ContentsA significant portion of our net sales is derived from a relatively small number of projects and customers; therefore, the failure to complete existing contracts on a timely basis, to receive payment for such services in a timely manner, or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect our ability to meet cash requirements exclusively through operating activities. We attempt to minimize the risk of losing customers or specific contracts by continually improving commercial execution and product quality, delivering product on time and competing aggressively on the basis of price. We expect to continue to depend upon our principal customers for a significant portion of our sales, although our principal customers may not continue to purchase products and services from us at current levels, if at all. The loss of one or more major customers or a change in their buying patterns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our backlog figures may not accurately predict future sales.We use backlog to predict our anticipated future sales. Our year-end backlog was $41.2 million, $39.9 million, and $31.7 million at the end of fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We define “backlog” at any given point in time to consist of all firm, unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time. We expect to fill most items of backlog within the following 12 months. However, since orders may be rescheduled or canceled and a significant portion of our net sales is derived from a small number of customers, backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels. Moreover, we cannot be sure of when during the future 12-month period we will be able to recognize revenue corresponding to our backlog nor can we be certain that revenues corresponding to our backlog will not fall into periods beyond the 12-month horizon. There is a limited availability of sites suitable for cladding operations.Our cladding process involves the detonation of large amounts of explosives. As a result, the sites where we perform cladding must meet certain criteria, including adequate distance from densely populated areas, specific geological characteristics, and the ability to comply with local noise and vibration abatement regulations in conducting the process. Our shooting sites in Pennsylvania and in Germany are located in mines. Our Pennsylvania shooting site is subleased under an arrangement pursuant to which we provide certain contractual services to the sub-landlord, and this sublease expires in 2029. In addition, we could experience difficulty in obtaining or renewing permits because of resistance from residents in the vicinity of existing or proposed sites. The failure to obtain required governmental approvals or permits could limit our ability to expand our cladding business in the future, and the failure to maintain such permits or satisfy other conditions to use the sites would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.There is no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully against other manufacturers of competitive products.Our explosion-welded clad products compete on a worldwide basis with explosion-welded clad products made by other manufacturers in the clad metal business and with products manufactured using other technologies. We see competition from one large well-known clad supplier and from a growing number of smaller companies with explosion welded clad manufacturing capability in China and India. Explosion-welded clad products also compete with products manufactured by roll bond and weld overlay cladding processes. The technical and commercial niches of each cladding process are well understood within the industry and vary from one world market location to another and at different metal prices. We focus on reliability, product quality, on-time delivery performance, and low-cost manufacturing to minimize the potential of future competitive threats. However, there is no guarantee we will be able to maintain our competitive position.Customers have the right to change orders until products are completed.Customers have some rights to change orders after they have been placed. If orders are changed, the extra expenses associated with the change usually will be passed on to the customer. However, because a change in an order may delay completion of the project, recognition of income for the project may also be delayed. Additionally, any errors or changes as to specifications or significant changes in pricing or availability of materials may cause cost overruns and delays in completion of projects. If we fail to meet delivery schedules, we may be required to pay damages or may risk loss of an order, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We do not maintain a reserve fund for warranty or defective products claims. Our costs could substantially increase if we experience a large claim or a significant number of warranty claims. Our product warranties against technical defects of our clad products vary depending on our purchase orders with customers. The warranties require us to repair or replace defective products and may require the payment of a certain percentage of the 20Table of Contentspurchase price as liquidated damages for our failure to meet the specified product specifications and delivery requirements. In addition, our clad products are often used as part of larger projects or are used in potentially hazardous applications that can cause injury or loss of life and damage to property or equipment. In the event of an actual or alleged product defect, we may be named as a defendant in product liability or other lawsuits asserting potentially large claims. We cannot guarantee that insurance will be available or adequate to cover any or all liabilities incurred. We have not established any reserve funds for potential warranty claims since historically we have experienced few warranty claims for our products and the costs associated with our warranty claims have been low. If we experience an increase in warranty claims or if our repair and replacement costs associated with warranty claims increase significantly, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Risk Factors
 Related to our Businesses GenerallyThe COVID-19 pandemic and related economic impacts have had a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions taken by businesses and governments to contain the spread of the virus, have resulted in a significant disruption in international and US economic activity. In the oil and gas industry, geopolitical events that increased the supply of low priced oil to the global market occurred at the same time that demand weakened due to the worldwide effects of the pandemic, leading to a collapse in oil prices in March 2020. These events together adversely affected the demand for oil and natural gas and caused significant volatility and disruption of the global financial markets. These impacts affected the demand for DynaEnergetics’ products and significantly delayed certain NobelClad projects and orders, and many of these impacts have continued. Other effects of the pandemic have included, and may continue to include, adverse revenue and net income effects; customer shutdowns of oil and gas exploration and production activities; downward revisions to customer budgets; limitations on access to sources of liquidity; increased costs to address health and safety requirements, supply chain disruptions, transportation disruptions, inflationary impacts for raw materials and labor, employee impacts from illness and from changes in worker preferences; labor shortages, workforce fluctuations in response to activity declines and increases; and temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers and suppliers. This period of extreme economic disruption, volatile oil prices and demand for our products has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The extent to which our operating and financial results will continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or by the secondary impacts of the pandemic will depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control, such as the duration and scope of the pandemic or future outbreaks, additional actions by businesses and governments and economic impacts of those actions. COVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, could also aggravate our other risk factors described in this Form 10-K.Our operations are subject to political and economic instability and risk of government actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. We are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries in which we operate. Our operations are subject to various risks unique to each country that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. With respect to any particular country, these risks may include:•political, social and economic instability; •civil unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war, other armed conflict;•public health crises and catastrophic events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; •inflation;•currency fluctuations, devaluations, conversion, or repatriation restrictions;•expropriation and nationalization of our assets;•confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies;•theft of, or lack of sufficient legal protection for, proprietary technology and other intellectual property;•limitations on extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing;•limitations or disruptions to our markets or operations, restrictions on payments, or limitations on the movement of funds;•increased tariffs;•trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions;•unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements, including changes in interpretation or enforcement of existing laws;•deprivation of contract rights; and•the inability to obtain or retain licenses required for operation.21Table of ContentsOur operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter.We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in annual and quarterly operating results caused by various factors at our businesses. At NobelClad, quarterly sales and operating results depend on the volume and timing of the orders in our backlog as well as bookings during the quarter. At DynaEnergetics, the level of demand from our customers is impacted by oil and gas prices as well as a variety of other factors and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Arcadia’s results are similarly subject to factors that can change significantly in short periods of time. Significant portions of our operating expenses are fixed, and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts and product development programs. If sales do not meet our expectations in any given period, the adverse impact on operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust operating expenses sufficiently or quickly enough to compensate for such a shortfall. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results for any future period. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”We are exposed to potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against the currencies of many of our operating subsidiaries. Many of our operating subsidiaries conduct business in euros, Canadian dollars, or other foreign currencies. Sales made in currencies other than U.S. dollars accounted for 16%, 17%, and 12% of total sales for the years ended 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of any of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience foreign currency translation (gains) losses with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. In addition, our company and our operating subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we or they enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or their respective functional currencies. For example, DynaEnergetics Europe's functional currency is euros, but its sales often occur in U.S. dollars. Changes in exchange rates with respect to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. In addition, we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to our operating subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities and to the financial results of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of equity. Our primary exposure to foreign currency risk is the euro, due to the percentage of our U.S. dollar revenue that is derived from countries where the euro is the functional currency. We use foreign currency forward contracts, generally with maturities of one month, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated asset and liability account balances. These hedge transactions relate to our operating entities with significant economic exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. Our primary economic exposures include the U.S. dollar to the euro, the U.S. dollar to the Canadian dollar, and the euro to the U.S. Dollar. Since the underlying balance sheet account balances being hedged can fluctuate significantly throughout our monthly hedge periods, our hedging program cannot fully protect against foreign currency fluctuations.Disruptions or delays involving our suppliers or increases in prices for the components, raw materials and parts that we obtain from our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations.Our operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the components, raw materials and parts that we need to manufacture our products. In some instances, we purchase components, raw materials and parts that are ultimately derived from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. Any number of factors, including labor disruptions, acts of war or terrorism, military activity, trade sanctions, catastrophic weather events, the occurrence of a pandemic or other widespread illness (such as COVID-19), contractual or other disputes, unfavorable economic or industry conditions, transportation disruptions, delivery delays or other performance problems or financial difficulties or solvency problems, could disrupt our suppliers’ operations and performance, which could, in turn, lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions for us and disrupt our operations. Although we have been able to manage supply chain impacts through the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced longer lead times for certain materials and have in other cases had heightened difficulty in sourcing materials. Lockdown orders or a prolonged period of travel, commercial and other similar restrictions could cause additional global supply disruptions. If we experience further supply disruptions, we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly. Any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of components, raw materials or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules or suspend production entirely, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.The terms of our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants, the breach of any of which could result in acceleration of payment of our credit facilities.22Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2021, following the acquisition of Arcadia, we had an outstanding balance of approximately $150.0 million on our syndicated credit agreement. This agreement includes various covenants and restrictions and certain of these relate to the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the mortgaging, pledging or disposing of major assets. We are also required to maintain certain financial ratios on a quarterly basis. A breach of any of these covenants could impair our ability to borrow and could result in acceleration of our obligations to repay our debt, if we are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment from our lenders. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and other provisions of the credit agreement, as amended, and our other loan agreements. Any failure to remain in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our credit agreement could result in a default, which would, absent a waiver or amendment, require immediate repayment of outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities.If our customers delay paying or fail to pay a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. We depend on a limited number of significant customers in our DynaEnergetics and NobelClad businesses, and the loss of one or more significant customers or the failure of a customer to pay outstanding amounts due could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated results of operations. In most cases, we bill our customers for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to the risk that our customers will delay payment of or fail to pay our invoices. In weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers’ cash flow from operations and in their access to the credit markets and rising interest rates. If our customers delay paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.Tariffs imposed by the U.S. government and related counter tariffs have increased our costs, limited the availability of metals and may lead to further trade conflicts.In 2018, the U.S. announced tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum imported from countries where we typically source metals. These tariffs were met with retaliatory tariffs from certain countries and increased, broader tariffs were levied by the U.S. on targeted countries, including China. Certain of these tariffs have been modified, however, impacts and uncertainties are continuing. The tariffs impacted the cost of the importation of steel, which we utilize in our steel plate and steel pipe, key materials in our NobelClad and DynaEnergetics businesses. Though in many cases we have been able to source metals from domestic suppliers, some materials are only available from sources subject to tariffs. The cost of domestic steel and aluminum has also increased, along with the price of delivery, and the availability of certain materials has been limited. These increased costs have increased the price of our products to our customers and, in some instances, affected our ability to be competitive. For our NobelClad business, this impacts our ability to compete on international projects and negatively impacts U.S. fabricators, which are the primary consumers of NobelClad products. Although some of these tariffs have been subsequently reduced or eliminated, as occurred in connection with the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA), many tariffs continue to exist and new tariffs have been and may be imposed at any time. The prolonged duration of tariffs, the imposition of additional tariffs and the risk of potential broader global trade conflicts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Failure to attract and retain key personnel and source sufficient labor could adversely affect our current operating results.Our continued success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical employees, and our ability to secure sufficient manufacturing labor. In recent years, various factors have cause increased competition for employees. In order to meet the needs and expectations of our customers and to achieve our growth objectives, we must attract, train, and retain a large number of hourly associates, while at the same time controlling labor costs. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training, retention and other costs. In certain areas where we operate, there is significant competition for employees. The lack of availability of an adequate number of hourly employees, or our inability to attract and retain them, including due to us having to increase wages paid to new and/or to current employees to attract, hire and/or retain the labor resources necessary to conduct our operations, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We are subject to applicable rules and regulations relating to our relationship with our employees, including wage and hour regulations, health benefits, unemployment and payroll taxes, overtime and working conditions and immigration status. Accordingly, federal, state or locally legislated increases in the minimum wage, as well as increases in additional labor cost components such as employee benefit costs, workers’ compensation insurance rates, compliance costs and fines, would increase our labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.  If we are unable to retain existing employees, provide a safe and healthy working environment, and/or recruit and train additional employees with the requisite skills and experience, our operating results could be adversely impacted.23Table of ContentsA failure in our information technology systems or those of third parties, including those caused by security breaches, cyber-attacks or data protection failures, could disrupt our business, damage our reputation, result in litigation or enforcement action, and cause losses. We are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our operations. Our information technology systems are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and banking information and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. The risk of cybersecurity incidents may increase with the political and economic instability or warfare (including the recent outbreak of hostilities between Russia and Ukraine). Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, theft, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.We outsource certain technology and business process functions to third parties and may increasingly do so in the future. If we do not effectively develop, implement and monitor our outsourcing strategy, if third party providers do not perform as anticipated or if we experience technological or other problems with a transition, we may not realize productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and loss of business. Our outsourcing of certain technology and business processes functions to third parties may expose us to enhanced risks related to data security, which could result in monetary and reputational damages. In addition, our ability to receive services from third party providers may be impacted by cultural differences, political instability, and unanticipated regulatory requirements or policies. As a result, our ability to conduct our business may be adversely affected.The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. We are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state laws and non-U.S. laws and regulations governing the protection of personal and confidential information of our customers and employees. In particular, the European Union (“E.U.”) has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which contains numerous requirements that must be complied with when handling the personal data of E.U.-based data subjects. We are subject to the GDPR with respect to our E.U. operations and employees. The GDPR and similar laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and sometimes conflict. In particular, as the E.U. member states reframe their national legislation to harmonize with the GDPR, we will need to monitor compliance with all relevant E.U. member states' laws and regulations, including where permitted derogations from the GDPR are introduced. In addition, California has passed an omnibus data privacy law similar to GDPR, the California Consumer Protection Privacy Act (“CCPA”), and with our 2021 acquisition of Arcadia, we will be subject to compliance obligations under this law. The states of Virginia and Colorado have recently enacted omnibus data privacy laws, and California has enacted more expensive data privacy and security laws (including a provision applying data obligations to employees), all of which will begin enforcement in 2023. The U.S. Congress and legislatures in several states are actively considering data privacy and security legislation.The evolving government-imposed data obligations would potentially subject us to civil penalties or litigation damages. The GDPR, any resultant changes in E.U. member states' national laws and regulations, and existing or new U.S. state or federal data privacy laws and regulations may increase our compliance obligations and may necessitate the review and implementation of policies and processes relating to our collection and use of data. This increase in compliance obligations could also lead to an increase in compliance costs which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any person, including any of our employees or those with whom we share such information, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to our client or employee data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. For example, under the GDPR penalties for noncompliance can be imposed up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of a firm's global annual revenue. Current California law supports class action litigation and statutory damages for data exposure incidents. In addition, a data breach could result in negative publicity which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.If we fail to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results in a timely and reliable manner, which could harm our business and impact the value of our securities.24Table of ContentsWe depend on our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements in order to run our business. If we fail to do so, our business could be negatively affected and our independent registered public accounting firm may be unable to attest to the fair presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be harmed. Even effective internal controls have inherent limitations including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or a deterioration in the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures.If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls, including any failure to implement new or improved controls as may be required by acquisitions or other changes in our business, or if we experience difficulties in their execution, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In the event that our current internal control practices deteriorate, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and investor confidence and the market price of our stock may be adversely affected.We are subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future. We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to litigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings with other parties. Managing or defending such legal proceedings may result in substantial legal fees, expenses and costs and diversion of management resources. If material litigation is brought against us in the future, a decision adverse to DMC could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. For a more detailed discussion of pending litigation, see Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event of a dispute arising at our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels, or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. Our inability to enforce our rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.Legal and Regulatory RisksOur operations require us to comply with numerous laws and regulations, violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition or cash flows.Our operations are subject to international, regional, national, and local laws and regulations in every place where we operate, relating to matters such as environmental protection, health and safety, labor and employment, import/export controls, currency exchange, bribery and corruption, data privacy and cybersecurity, intellectual property, immigration, and taxation. These laws and regulations are complex, frequently change, and have tended to become more stringent over time. In the event the scope of these laws and regulations expands in the future, the incremental cost of compliance could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.Our international operations are subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations, such as the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other similar laws. We are also subject to trade control regulations and trade sanctions laws that restrict the movement of certain goods to, and certain operations in, various countries or with certain persons. These trade regulations and laws can include restrictions on selling or importing goods, services or technology in or from affected regions, travel bans and asset freezes impacting connected individuals and political, military, business and financial organizations and can change very quickly, such as has occurred in connection with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Our ability to transfer people, products and data among certain countries is subject to maintaining required licenses and complying with these laws and regulations.The internal controls, policies and procedures, and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or from material violations of applicable laws and regulations. Any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of anti-bribery, trade control, trade sanctions or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Violations of international and US laws and regulations or the loss of any required licenses may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies or restrictions on business conduct, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. In addition, any major violations could have 25Table of Contentsa significant effect on our reputation and consequently on our ability to win future business and maintain existing customer and supplier relationships.The use of explosives in our DynaEnergetics and NobelClad manufacturing processes and products subject us to additional environmental, health and safety laws and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities.DynaEnergetics uses explosive materials in its manufacturing processes and products. NobelClad’s manufacturing process involves the detonation of large quantities of explosives. The use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity. These activities subject us to extensive environmental and health and safety laws and regulations including guidelines and regulations for the purchase, manufacture, handling, transport, storage and use of explosives issued by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety regulations set forth by the U.S. Department of Transportation; the Safety Library Publications of the Institute of Makers of Explosive; and similar guidelines of their European counterparts. In Germany, the transport, storage and use of explosives is governed by a permit issued under the Explosives Act (Sprengstoffgesetz). Despite our use of specialized facilities to store and handle dangerous materials and our employee training programs, the storage and handling of explosive materials could result in explosive incidents that temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupt our or our customers’ operations or cause restrictions, delays or cancellations in the delivery of our services. It is possible that such an explosion could result in death or significant injuries to employees and other persons. Material property damage to us, our customers and third parties arising from an explosion or resulting fire could also occur. Any explosion could expose us to adverse publicity and liability for damages or cause production restrictions, delays or cancellations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable requirements or the occurrence of an explosive incident may also result in the loss of our license to store and handle explosives, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions.Demand for our products could be reduced by existing and future legislation, regulations and public sentiment. Regulatory agencies and environmental advocacy groups in the United States, the E.U., and other regions or countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their role in climate change. There is also increased focus, including by governments and our customers, investors and other stakeholders, on these and other sustainability and energy transition matters. Existing or future legislation and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, as well as initiatives by governments, non-governmental organizations, and companies to conserve energy or promote the use of alternative energy sources, and negative attitudes toward or perceptions of fossil fuel products and their relationship to the environment, may significantly curtail demand for and production of oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and thus reduce future demand for some of our products. In addition, some international, national, state and local governments and agencies have also adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on directly limiting the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing. These laws and regulations could limit oil and gas development, lead to operational delays and increased costs for our customers, and therefore reduce demand for our products. Such reductions in demand for our products may, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Increased negative investor sentiment toward oil and gas and preference for assets outside of traditional energy sectors could lead to higher capital costs for our customers and reduced investment in fossil fuels, thereby reducing demand for our products. Such preferences could also impact our ability to obtain acceptable debt or equity financing on attractive terms or at all and could negatively impact our stock price over time. Our business, reputation and demand for our stock could be negatively affected if we do not (or are perceived to not) act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters.We are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. We are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulation in the United States and the other countries where our manufacturing facilities are located. Among other things, these laws regulate the emissions or discharge of materials into the environment; govern the use, storage, treatment, disposal and management of hazardous substances and wastes; protect the health and safety of our employees; regulate the materials used in our products or manufacturing processes; and impose liability for the costs of investigating and remediating (as well as other damages resulting from) present and past releases of hazardous substances. Representative laws and regulations which we may be subject to the in the U.S. include: noise abatement 26Table of Contentsand air emissions regulations, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state laws, and various regulations and laws enforced by the U.S Department of Labor, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and their state equivalents. Violations of these laws or of any conditions contained in environmental permits can result in substantial fines or penalties, injunctive relief, requirements to install pollution controls or other equipment, and civil sanctions. We could be held liable for costs to investigate, remediate or otherwise address contamination at any real property we have ever owned, operated or used as a disposal site, or at other sites where we or predecessors may have released hazardous materials. We could incur fines, penalties or sanctions or be subject to third-party claims, including indemnification claims, for property damage, personal injury or otherwise as a result of violations of (or liabilities under) environmental, health and safety laws, or in connection with releases of hazardous or other materials.Changes in or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or enforcement policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of other environmental liabilities or obligations in the future including additional investigation, remediation or other obligations with respect to our products or business activities may lead to additional compliance costs or require us to change our manufacturing processes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.In Germany, we and all our activities are subject to various safety and environmental regulations of the federal state which are enforced by the local authorities, including the Federal Act on Emission Control (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz). The Federal Act on Emission Control permits are held by companies jointly owned by DynaEnergetics and the other companies that are located at the Troisdorf manufacturing site and are for an indefinite period of time. The Dillenburg, Germany facility is operated based on a specific permit granted by the local mountain authority and must be renewed every three years. Any failure to comply with current and future environmental and safety regulations could subject us to significant liabilities. Any actual or alleged violations of environmental, health or safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities or substantial civil or criminal sanctions. In addition, under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our facilities and at third party waste disposal sites, even when such contamination was caused by a predecessor and even when the actions resulting in the contamination were lawful at the time. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage. Changes in or interpretation of tax law control could impact the determination of our income tax liabilities for a tax year.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S and have significant intercompany transactions between our affiliates. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about intercompany transfer pricing arrangements may result in higher effective tax rates for the Company. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or their interpretation, both domestically and internationally. For example, regulations related to the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) are still being developed, some with retroactive application. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to tax law, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, countries where the Company is subject to taxes are independently evaluating their corporate tax policy, which could result in tax legislation and enforcement that adversely impacts the Company’s tax provision and value of deferred tax assets and liabilities. For instance, tax reform proposals in the U.S. includes changes to the corporate tax rate, changes to taxation of foreign-derived income, limitations on interest deductions of international financial reporting groups, and increases to the tax rate applied to profits earned outside the U.S.We are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions from time to time. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. The final resolution of any audits or litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made.Intellectual Property Risks27Table of ContentsOur failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position. The protection of our intellectual property rights is essential to maintaining our competitive position and recognizing the value of our investments in technology and intellectual property in our existing and future products. We rely on trade secret protection for certain aspects of our technology, in part through confidentiality and other written agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties. Through these and other written agreements, we attempt to control access to and distribution of our intellectual property documentation and other proprietary technology information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, former employees, consultants or third parties may, in an unauthorized manner, attempt to use, copy or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property rights or technology or otherwise develop a product with the same functionality as our technology. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights is difficult, and nearly impossible on a worldwide basis. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property rights.We also actively pursue patent protection for our proprietary technology and intellectual property. The process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and we cannot be certain that any currently pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents, or that, even if patents are issued, they will be respected by third parties. In addition, our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets, and this could have a similar effect on our competitive position.Intellectual property litigation and threats of litigation are becoming more common in the oilfield services industry. We are currently involved and may in the future be involved in litigation, in the United States or abroad, to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to protect our trade secrets and know-how. These actions can require multiple years to come to resolution or settlement, and even if we ultimately prevail, we may be unable to realize adequate protection of our competitive position. In addition, these actions commonly result in actions by the affected third parties to establish the invalidity of our patents. While we intend to prosecute these actions vigorously, there is no guarantee of success, and such effort takes significant financial and management resources from the Company. In the event that one or more of our patents are challenged, a court or the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) may invalidate the patent(s) or determine that the patent(s) is not enforceable, which could harm our competitive position. If our patents are invalidated, or if the scope of the claims in any of these patents is limited by a court or USPTO decision, we could be prevented from pursuing certain litigation matters or licensing the invalidated or limited portion of such patents. Such adverse decisions could negatively impact our future, expected revenue. Patent litigation, if necessary or when instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources.We may incur substantial costs defending against third parties alleging that we infringe their proprietary rights.We are currently involved and may in the future be involved in litigation relating to alleged infringement by us of others’ patents or other intellectual property rights. We have an active ""freedom to operate"" review process for our technology, but there is no assurance that future infringement claims will not be asserted. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core businesses even if we are ultimately successful. In the event of any adverse ruling in any intellectual property litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacturing, use and sale of infringing products, discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain a license from the third party claiming infringement with royalty payment obligations by us. We also have certain indemnification obligations to customers with respect to the infringement of third party intellectual property rights by our products, which may increase our costs. Any of these occurrences could significantly harm our competitive position, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Risks Related to AcquisitionsThe acquisition of Arcadia may not achieve its intended results and may result in us assuming unanticipated liabilities.Achieving the anticipated benefits of the recent acquisition of a 60% ownership stake in Arcadia is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. For example, the due diligence we have conducted on Arcadia may have failed to uncover issues that result in the acquisition being less beneficial than we expect or in us assuming environmental or other liabilities that are larger than we expect. Under the Equity Purchase Agreement, we have only limited recourse to the sellers for any such issues. We cannot assure you that such potential recourse will be available or adequate for any liabilities we incur, and such liabilities could be significant.28Table of ContentsAs a result of our acquisition of Arcadia, we have significantly more sales, assets and employees than we did prior to the transaction, which may require our management to devote a significant amount of time, resources and attention to the new product offerings or novel challenges, and/or away from the operations of our historical businesses. These potential diversions and distractions may result in, or involve activities that cause, increased expenses and unanticipated liabilities.The success of the acquisition will depend on numerous factors, many of which are outside of our control, including general market and economic conditions, particularly those affecting the construction and related industries in the western United States. The regulatory environment, our ability to manage Arcadia’s business effectively and integrate it within our overall management structure, and our success in pursuing growth opportunities are also subject to risks and uncertainties. Arcadia’s large size relative to our existing businesses exacerbates some of these risks, as does the fact that the industries in which it operates are different than those of our existing businesses. In addition, under the Operating Agreement, we will not have exclusive control over Arcadia’s operations, and this may result in us being unable to manage it effectively. For these or other reasons, we may not be able to obtain the benefits we anticipate from the Acquisition.We have and will incur substantial financial obligations in connection with the Acquisition.As described above, we financed a portion of the purchase price of the Arcadia acquisition with proceeds from the Credit Facility. Our ability to service the indebtedness under the Credit Facility and to maintain compliance with the covenants included in the Credit Facility will depend on our success in achieving the intended benefits of the acquisition, which is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as discussed above. We will have to devote a substantial portion of our cash flow to meet required payments of principal and interest on this indebtedness, and if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to do so, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the terms of the Credit Facility, we could be in default under the agreement. In the event of such default, the lenders could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets. In that event, we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If the performance of Arcadia and our existing businesses decline or fail to meet our expectations, we may in the future need to seek waivers from the lenders under the Credit Facility to avoid being in default. If we breach, or are at risk of breaching, our covenants under the agreement, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs, we would be in default under the agreement and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to the Credit Facility if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements, or that we will be able to refinance the Credit Facility on terms acceptable to us, or at all.In addition, as early as three years after the closing of the Arcadia acquisition, we may be required to pay the Option Purchase Price for some or all of Munera’s interests in Arcadia if Munera exercises the Put Option. Even if we elect to pay 80% of the Option Purchase Price in preferred stock, we will need to fund the remaining portion in cash. We do not currently have sufficient funds to pay the cash portion of the Option Purchase Price, and we may not be able to obtain such funds on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our ability to finance the Option Purchase Price will depend on numerous factors, including our and Arcadia’s performance and general market and economic conditions. If we fail to pay the Option Purchase Price when required under the Operating Agreement, we will be in default under the agreement. The Option Purchase Price is not currently determinable and is likely to be substantial relative to the current size of our business. In addition, the Option Purchase Price is subject to a “floor” that will apply even if Arcadia’s performance fails to meet our expectations. This may make it more difficult for us to finance the payment of the Option Purchase Price. In addition, debt or preferred equity financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include liens or restrictions on our assets and covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as paying dividends or making distributions, incurring additional debt, acquiring or disposing of assets or increasing expenses. Debt financing would also be required to be repaid regardless of our operating results. Obtaining financing through issuances of common stock would impose fewer restrictions on our future operations but would be dilutive to the interests of existing stockholders.After the Arcadia acquisition, DMC is the majority shareholder of Arcadia, and our interest in Arcadia is subject to the risks normally associated with the conduct of businesses with a minority shareholder.Pursuant to the Equity Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we acquired a 60% ownership stake in Arcadia, Munera continues to hold 40% of the outstanding equity interests of Arcadia.  Our Operating Agreement governs our relationship with Munera, and we believe the Operating Agreement provides us with effective and sufficient control of Arcadia to allow the business to be operated consistent with our goals and values and with sufficient opportunity for profitable growth. Nevertheless, conducting a business with minority owners may lead to certain risks and uncertainties, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to profitably grow the Arcadia business, which could have a material adverse impact on our future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition. These include:•our ability to effectively control certain strategic, operational and financial decisions;29Table of Contents•the potential for disagreement over the direction of the company and costs and expenses involved; and•the risk of having economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with, or opposed to, those of Munera.There can be no assurance that the acquisition will be beneficial to us, whether due to the above-described risks, unfavorable economic conditions, integration challenges or other factors.Fully integrating Arcadia’s business following the acquisition may be more difficult, costly and time-consuming than expected, which may adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our common stock.While the Company’s management has begun the progress in integrating Arcadia’s business into DMC, integration efforts will be substantial and continuing. The integration process is complex, costly and time-consuming, and the Company’s management may face significant, ongoing challenges in implementing such integration, many of which may be beyond the control of management, including, without limitation:•difficulties in achieving anticipated expansion and growth prospects;•the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process;•unanticipated issues in integrating accounting, information technology, communications programs, financial procedures and operations, and other systems, procedures and policies;•cybersecurity issues as we integrate Arcadia into our programs and systems;•failure to implement effective internal and disclosure controls;•difficulties in managing a larger corporation, addressing differences in business culture and retaining key personnel;•impacts on employee, supplier and customer relationships;•failure to address any pre-existing liabilities or claims involving the acquired business;•unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;•coordinating geographically separate organizations; and•unforeseen expenses or delays associated with integration efforts.Some of these factors are outside the control of the Company, and any one of them could result in increased costs and diversion of management’s time and energy, as well as decreases in revenue or increases in cost, which could materially impact the business, financial conditions and results of operations of the Company. The acquisition of Arcadia is expected to materially complicate the timely achievement of effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price. Prior to the acquisition, Arcadia operated as a closely-held, private company, which had no previous public reporting obligations and therefore, did not historically institute and evaluate its internal controls and procedures in compliance with Section 404. Implementing changes to our internal controls will be required following the acquisition and may take a significant period of time to complete, and may require significant effort and involvement of directors, officers and employees, and may entail substantial costs in order to modify existing accounting systems. Further, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the internal controls, disclosure controls and information technology infrastructure of the Company and Arcadia. Our efforts to assimilate and integrate our internal controls with Arcadia’s may not be effective, and any failure to maintain effective controls could result in material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements or otherwise cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. This, in turn, could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and our stock price, and we could be subject to stockholder litigation. To the extent that we seek to further expand our business through acquisitions, we may experience issues in executing acquisitions or integrating acquired operations. From time to time, we examine opportunities to make selective acquisitions in order to increase shareholder return by increasing our total available markets, expanding our existing operations and, potentially, generating synergies. The success of any acquisition depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: •identifying suitable candidates for acquisition and negotiating acceptable terms; •obtaining approval from regulatory authorities and potentially DMC’s shareholders; •maintaining our financial and strategic focus and avoiding distraction of management during the process of integrating the acquired business; 30Table of Contents•implementing our standards, controls, procedures and policies at the acquired business and addressing any pre-existing liabilities or claims involving the acquired business; •our ability to realize the expected tax treatment or tax benefits from the transaction; and •to the extent the acquired operations are in a country in which we have not operated historically, understanding the regulations and challenges of operating in that new jurisdiction.For example, our due diligence process may not reveal all liabilities associated with a potential acquisition, and this could result in us incurring unanticipated losses after the acquisition is completed. There can be no assurance that we will be able to conclude any acquisitions successfully or that any acquisition will achieve the anticipated synergies or other positive results. Any material problems that we encounter in connection with such an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Risk Factors
 Related to Our Common StockThe price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile, which may make it difficult for you to resell the common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive. The market price and trading volume of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations due to general stock market conditions and/or a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations, business prospects or liquidity. Among the factors that could affect the price of our common stock are: •changes in the architectural building products, oil and gas, industrial, or infrastructure markets; •operating and financial performance that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts or investors; •developments in our business or in our business sectors generally; •regulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations; •the operating and stock price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;•announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors;•our ability to integrate and operate the companies and the businesses that we acquire; •rumors and market speculation regarding our industries, business or trading activity;•significant amounts of short selling, the perception that short sales could occur and other speculative trading activity; •activism by any large stockholder or group of stockholders;•changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, including volatility in foreign exchange rates, tariffs and stock, commodity, credit or asset valuations, and federal government actions or shutdowns.The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has at times been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies, and these fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.Holders of our common stock do not currently receive dividends and our dividend may not be reinstated in the future.   Our Board of Directors suspended our dividend in April 2020 in order to preserve liquidity in light of the sharp reduction in demand for DynaEnergetics products and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors declares out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. In addition, dividends may not be permitted pursuant to the terms of debt or other agreements to which we are subject. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and there can be no assurance as to whether the Board will reinstate a dividend in the future"

Please carefully consider the following discussion of material factors, events, and uncertainties that make our business and an investment in our securities subject to risk. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in 12Table of Contentscircumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations.Risk Factors
 Related to DynaEnergeticsDemand for DynaEnergetics’ products is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry. Decreases or expected decreases in oil and gas prices and reduced expenditures in the oil and gas industry could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Demand for the majority of our products depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry’s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. Continued low oil and gas prices have resulted in reduced North American completion activity and lower expenditures by the oil and gas industry.  This has resulted in reduced cash flows for our customers, which are further exacerbated by the increasing pressure being placed on E&P companies by investors to reduce their cost of operations. If these trends continue or worsen, we would expect continued reduced or delayed oil and gas exploration and production spending, project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us, all of which could result in reduced demand for our products, downward pressure on selling prices for our products and decreased revenues and profits. These effects have had, and will likely continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and can be affected by a variety of factors, including:  •changes in the supply of and demand for hydrocarbons, which are affected by general economic, business and regulatory conditions;•the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and other oil producing companies to set and maintain production levels for oil;•oil and gas production levels in the U.S. and by other non-OPEC countries;•the level of excess production capacity;•speculation as to the future price of oil and the speculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts;•government initiatives to restrict oil and gas drilling or development or promote the use of renewable energy sources and public sentiment regarding the same;•political and economic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest;•the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and production activity;•access to potential resources;•changes in governmental policies and subsidies;•the costs of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;•technological advances affecting energy consumption; and•weather conditions.The oil and gas industry has historically been extremely cyclical. However, there can be no assurance that the demand or pricing for oil and natural gas or for our products and services will follow historic patterns or recover meaningfully in the near or medium term. Continued or worsening conditions in the oil and gas industry generally may have a further material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.Failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customers demand could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing, internal fabrication utilization and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customer requirements. Factors that can impact our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements include the short-term nature of many customers’ commitments, our customers’ ability to reschedule, cancel and modify orders with little or no notice and without significant penalty, the accuracy of our customers’ forecasts, and seasonal or cyclical trends in customers' industries. 13Table of ContentsTo ensure availability of our products, particularly for our largest customers, we may start manufacturing our relevant products based on our customers’ forecasts, which are not binding. As a result, we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales that may never materialize or which may be substantially lower than expected. If actual demand for our products is lower than forecast, we may also experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and product obsolescence. Because certain of our sales, research and development, and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income. Conversely, customers often require rapid increases in production on short notice. We may be unable to secure sufficient materials or contract manufacturing capacity to meet such increases in demand. This could damage our customer relationships, reduce revenue growth and margins, subject us to additional liabilities, harm our reputation, and prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities.Failure to manage periods of growth or contraction may seriously harm our business.Our industry frequently sees periods of expansion and contraction which require companies to adjust to customers’ needs and market demands.  We regularly contend with these issues and must carefully manage our business to meet customer and market requirements. If we fail to manage these growth and contraction decisions effectively, we may find ourselves with either excess or insufficient resources and our business and our profitability could suffer as a result.Periods of contraction or reduced net sales, or other factors negatively affecting particular markets require us to assess whether facilities remain viable, whether staffing levels need to be reduced, and how to respond to changing levels of customer demand. While maintaining excess capacity or higher levels of employment entails short-term costs, reductions in capacity or employment could impair our ability to respond to new opportunities and programs, market improvements or to maintain customer relationships. Our decisions to reduce costs and capacity can affect our short-term and long-term results and result in restructuring charges.Expansions, including the transfer of operations to other facilities or the construction of new manufacturing facilities, include the risk of additional costs and start-up inefficiencies. If we are unable to effectively manage our expansion projects or related anticipated net sales are not realized, our operating results could be materially adversely affected. Risks of future expansions include:•difficulties in the timing of expansions, including delays in the implementation of construction and manufacturing plans;•the inability to successfully integrate additional facilities or incremental capacity and to realize anticipated efficiencies, economies of scale or other value;•challenges faced as a result of transitioning programs;•additional fixed or other costs, or selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses, which may not be fully absorbed by the new business;•a reduction of our return on invested capital, including as a result of excess inventory or excess capacity at new facilities;•diversion of management’s attention from other business areas during the planning and implementation of expansions;•increased debt levels and borrowing costs;•strain placed on our operational, financial and other systems and resources; and•inability to locate sufficient employees or management talent to support the expansion.Consolidation of our customers and competitors may impact our results of operations.The oil and gas industry has experienced periods of consolidation in the past, and we expect consolidations to increase as the industry deals with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting impacts on oil and gas supply and demand. Industry consolidation may result in reduced capital spending by some of our customers, the loss of customers, or consolidated entities using size and purchasing power to seek pricing or other concessions, which may lead to decreased demand for our products. In addition, recent, pending and future mergers, combinations and consolidations amongst our competitors could result in existing competitors increasing their market share or improving their relative financial strength, which may result in stronger competitors. As a result, industry consolidation may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.We may not be able to continue to compete successfully against other companies in our industry.14Table of ContentsThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive. DynaEnergetics competes with a broad spectrum of companies that produce and market perforating services and products. Many of these companies are large national and multi-national companies, including the oil and natural gas industry’s largest oilfield service providers. These companies have longer operating histories, greater financial, technical, and other resources, and greater name recognition than we do. In addition, we compete with many smaller companies capable of competing effectively on a regional or local basis. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. To remain competitive, DynaEnergetics must continue to provide innovative products and maintain an excellent reputation for value, quality, on-time delivery, and safety. If we fail to compete successfully against our competition, we may be unable to maintain acceptable sales levels, prices and margins for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.If we are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, and technology trends, our business and consolidated results of operations and the value of our intellectual property could be materially and adversely affected. The market for our products is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better and more reliable performance and enhanced product offerings. If we are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, and technology trends, our business and consolidated results of operations and the value of our intellectual property could be materially and adversely affected. Likewise, if our proprietary technologies, equipment, facilities, or work processes become obsolete, we may no longer be competitive, and our business and consolidated results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Risk Factors
 Related to NobelCladNobelClad’s business is dependent on sales to a limited number of customers in cyclical markets and our results are affected by the price of metals. NobelClad revenues are affected both by the demand for NobelClad’s explosion-welded cladding services and the base price of metal used in explosion-welded cladding operations. The explosion-welded cladding market is dependent upon sales of products for use by customers in a limited number of heavy industries, including oil and gas, chemicals and petrochemicals, alternative energy, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, rail car manufacturing, power generation, and industrial refrigeration. These industries tend to be cyclical in nature and an economic slowdown in one or all of these industries-whether due to traditional cyclicality, general economic conditions or other factors-could impact capital expenditures within that industry. In addition, metals prices affect the demand for cladded products and our margins. Higher metal prices increase demand by making it more economical for customers to use cladding on less-expensive metal than using solid metal plates. Higher metal prices also lead to higher sales (in terms of dollars rather than square meters of cladding) and generally higher margins for NobelClad. We have experienced a significant decline in the demand for clad products in recent years due in part to a low-metals price environment. If demand or metals prices do not increase or decline further, our sales would be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our backlog figures may not accurately predict future sales.We use backlog to predict our anticipated future sales. Our year-end backlog was $39.9 million, $31.7 million, and $29.9 million at the end of fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We define “backlog” at any given point in time to consist of all firm, unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time. We expect to fill most items of backlog within the following 12 months. However, since orders may be rescheduled or canceled and a significant portion of our net sales is derived from a small number of customers, backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels. Moreover, we cannot be sure of when during the future 12-month period we will be able to recognize revenue corresponding to our backlog nor can we be certain that revenues corresponding to our backlog will not fall into periods beyond the 12-month horizon. There is a limited availability of sites suitable for cladding operations.Our cladding process involves the detonation of large amounts of explosives. As a result, the sites where we perform cladding must meet certain criteria, including adequate distance from densely populated areas, specific geological characteristics, and the ability to comply with local noise and vibration abatement regulations in conducting the process. Our shooting sites in Pennsylvania and in Dillenburg, Germany are located in mines. Access to our Dillenburg mine is subject to a lease that expires in 2022, and if we are unable to negotiate a suitable extension of the lease, this could impact our operations. If a mine were seriously damaged, we might not be able to locate a suitable replacement site in a timely manner to continue our 15Table of Contentsoperations. In addition, our Pennsylvania shooting site is subleased under an arrangement pursuant to which we provide certain contractual services to the sub-landlord. The efforts to identify alternative suitable sites and obtain permits for using the sites from local government agencies can be time-consuming and may not be successful. In addition, we could experience difficulty in obtaining or renewing permits because of resistance from residents in the vicinity of existing or proposed sites. The failure to obtain required governmental approvals or permits could limit our ability to expand our cladding business in the future, and the failure to maintain such permits or satisfy other conditions to use the sites would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.There is no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully against other manufacturers of competitive products.Our explosion-welded clad products compete on a worldwide basis with explosion-welded clad products made by other manufacturers in the clad metal business and with products manufactured using other technologies. We see competition from one large well-known clad supplier and from a growing number of smaller companies with explosion welded clad manufacturing capability in China and India. Explosion-welded clad products also compete with products manufactured by roll bond and weld overlay cladding processes. The technical and commercial niches of each cladding process are well understood within the industry and vary from one world market location to another and at different metal prices. We focus on reliability, product quality, on-time delivery performance, and low-cost manufacturing to minimize the potential of future competitive threats. However, there is no guarantee we will be able to maintain our competitive position.Customers have the right to change orders until products are completed.Customers have the right to change orders after they have been placed. If orders are changed, the extra expenses associated with the change usually will be passed on to the customer. However, because a change in an order may delay completion of the project, recognition of income for the project may also be delayed. Additionally, any errors or changes as to specifications or significant changes in pricing or availability of materials may cause cost overruns and delays in completion of projects. If we fail to meet delivery schedules, we may be required to pay damages or may risk loss of an order, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We do not maintain a reserve fund for warranty or defective products claims. Our costs could substantially increase if we experience a large claim or a significant number of warranty claims. Our product warranties against technical defects of our clad products vary depending on our purchase orders with customers. The warranties require us to repair or replace defective products and may require the payment of a certain percentage of the purchase price as liquidated damages for our failure to meet the specified product specifications and delivery requirements. In addition, our clad products are often used as part of larger projects or are used in potentially hazardous applications that can cause injury or loss of life and damage to property or equipment. In the event of an actual or alleged product defect, we may be named as a defendant in product liability or other lawsuits asserting potentially large claims. We cannot guarantee that insurance will be available or adequate to cover any or all liabilities incurred. We have not established any reserve funds for potential warranty claims since historically we have experienced few warranty claims for our products and the costs associated with our warranty claims have been low. If we experience an increase in warranty claims or if our repair and replacement costs associated with warranty claims increase significantly, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Risk Factors
 Related to our Businesses GenerallyThe COVID-19 pandemic and related economic impacts have had, and are likely to continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions taken by businesses and governments to contain the spread of the virus, have resulted in a significant reduction in international and US economic activity.  In the oil and gas industry, geopolitical events that increased the supply of low priced oil to the global market occurred at the same time that demand weakened due to the worldwide effects of the pandemic, leading to a collapse in oil prices in March 2020. These events together adversely affected the demand for oil and natural gas and caused significant volatility and disruption of the global financial markets. These impacts affected the demand for DynaEnergetics’ products and significantly delayed certain NobelClad projects and orders.  Other effects of the pandemic have included, and may continue to include, adverse revenue and net income effects; customer shutdowns of oil and gas exploration and production activities; downward revisions to customer budgets; limitations on access to sources of liquidity; supply chain disruptions, employee impacts from illness, school closures and other community response measures; workforce fluctuations in response to activity declines and increases; and temporary closures of our 16Table of Contentsfacilities or the facilities of our customers and suppliers. This period of extreme economic disruption, low oil prices and reduced demand for our products has had, and is likely to continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The extent to which our operating and financial results will continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control, such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; additional actions by businesses and governments in response to the pandemic; and the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat the virus, including vaccine distribution. COVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, could also aggravate our other risk factors described in this Form 10-K.Our operations are subject to political and economic instability and risk of government actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. We are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries in which we operate. Our operations are subject to various risks unique to each country that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. With respect to any particular country, these risks may include:•political, social and economic instability; •civil unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war, other armed conflict, and sanctions;•public health crises and catastrophic events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; •inflation;•currency fluctuations, devaluations, conversion, or repatriation restrictions; and•expropriation and nationalization of our assets;•confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies;•theft of, or lack of sufficient legal protection for, proprietary technology and other intellectual property;•limitations on extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing;•limitations or disruptions to our markets or operations, restrictions on payments, or limitations on the movement of funds;•increased tariffs;•trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions;•unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements, including changes in interpretation or enforcement of existing laws;•deprivation of contract rights; and•the inability to obtain or retain licenses required for operation.Our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter.We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in annual and quarterly operating results caused by various factors at both NobelClad and DynaEnergetics. At NobelClad, quarterly sales and operating results depend on the volume and timing of the orders in our backlog as well as bookings during the quarter. At DynaEnergetics, the level of demand from our customers is impacted by oil and gas prices as well as a variety of other factors and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Significant portions of our operating expenses are fixed, and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts and product development programs. If sales do not meet our expectations in any given period, the adverse impact on operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust operating expenses sufficiently or quickly enough to compensate for such a shortfall. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results for any future period. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock.  We are exposed to potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against the currencies of many of our operating subsidiaries. Many of our operating subsidiaries conduct business in euros, Canadian dollars, or other foreign currencies. Sales made in currencies other than U.S. dollars accounted for 17%, 12%, and 21% of total sales for the years ended 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of any of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience foreign currency translation (gains) losses with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. In addition, our company and our operating subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we or they enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or their respective functional currencies. For example, DynaEnergetics Europe's functional currency is euros, but its sales often occur in U.S. dollars. Changes in exchange rates with respect to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. In addition, we are exposed 17Table of Contentsto foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to our operating subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities and to the financial results of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of equity. Our primary exposure to foreign currency risk is the euro, due to the percentage of our U.S. dollar revenue that is derived from countries where the euro is the functional currency. We use foreign currency forward contracts, generally with maturities of one month, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated asset and liability account balances. These hedge transactions relate to our operating entities with significant economic exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. Our primary economic exposures include the U.S. dollar to the euro, the U.S. dollar to the Canadian dollar, and the euro to the U.S. Dollar. Since the underlying balance sheet account balances being hedged can fluctuate significantly throughout our monthly hedge periods, our hedging program cannot fully protect against foreign currency fluctuations.Disruptions or delays involving our suppliers or increases in prices for the components, raw materials and parts that we obtain from our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations.Our operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the components, raw materials and parts that we need to manufacture our products.  In some instances, we purchase components, raw materials and parts that are ultimately derived from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. Any number of factors, including labor disruptions, military activity, catastrophic weather events, the occurrence of a pandemic or other widespread illness (such as COVID-19), contractual or other disputes, unfavorable economic or industry conditions, transportation disruptions, delivery delays or other performance problems or financial difficulties or solvency problems, could disrupt our suppliers’ operations and performance, which could, in turn, lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions for us and disrupt our operations. Although we have been able to manage supply chain impacts through the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been experiencing longer lead times for certain materials. Continued or increasing lockdown orders or a prolonged period of travel, commercial and other similar restrictions could cause additional global supply disruptions.  If we experience further supply disruptions, we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly. Any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of components, raw materials or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules or suspend production entirely, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.The terms of our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants, the breach of any of which could result in acceleration of payment of our credit facilities.As of December 31, 2020, we had an outstanding balance of approximately $11.8 million on our syndicated credit agreement. This agreement includes various covenants and restrictions and certain of these relate to the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the mortgaging, pledging or disposing of major assets. We are also required to maintain certain financial ratios on a quarterly basis. A breach of any of these covenants could impair our ability to borrow and could result in acceleration of our obligations to repay our debt, if we are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment from our lenders. In June 2020, we entered into an amendment to our credit facility that, among other things, waived our debt service coverage ratio for the quarters ending September 30, 2020, December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and other provisions of the credit agreement, as amended, and our other loan agreements. Any failure to remain in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our credit agreement could result in a default, which would, absent a waiver or amendment, require immediate repayment of outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities.We are dependent on a relatively small number of large projects and customers for a significant portion of our net sales.A significant portion of our net sales is derived from a relatively small number of projects and customers; therefore, the failure to complete existing contracts on a timely basis, to receive payment for such services in a timely manner, or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect our ability to meet cash requirements exclusively through operating activities. We attempt to minimize the risk of losing customers or specific contracts by continually improving commercial execution and product quality, delivering product on time and competing aggressively on the basis of price. We expect to continue to depend upon our principal customers for a significant portion of our sales, although our principal customers may not continue to purchase products and services from us at current levels, if at all. The loss of one or more major customers or a change in their buying patterns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.If our customers delay paying or fail to pay a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. 18Table of ContentsWe depend on a limited number of significant customers, and the loss of one or more significant customers or the failure of a customer to pay outstanding amounts due could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated results of operations.  In most cases, we bill our customers for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to the risk that our customers will delay payment of or fail to pay our invoices. In weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers’ cash flow from operations and their access to the credit markets and rising interest rates. If our customers delay paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.We are susceptible to the cyclicality of the steel industry. Steel plate and steel pipe are key materials used our NobelClad and DynaEnergetics’ businesses. The steel industry is very cyclical and is affected significantly by supply and demand factors, general economic conditions and other factors such as worldwide production capacity, fluctuations in steel imports/exports, tariffs and quotas. Continued low metals prices over the last ten years have had an adverse effect on the U.S. steel industry and on our NobelClad business, and future economic uncertainty or a prolonged period of stagnation in the economy could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Tariffs imposed by the U.S. government and related counter tariffs have increased our costs, limited the availability of metals and may lead to further trade conflicts.In 2018, the U.S. announced tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum imported from countries where we typically source metals. These tariffs were met with retaliatory tariffs from certain countries and increased, broader tariffs were levied by the U.S. on targeted countries, including China. The tariffs impacted the cost of the importation of steel, which we utilize in our steel plate and steel pipe, key materials in our NobelClad and DynaEnergetics businesses. Though in many cases we have been able to source metals from domestic suppliers, some materials are only available from sources subject to tariffs.  The cost of domestic steel and aluminum has also increased, along with the price of delivery, and the availability of certain materials has been limited. These increased costs have increased the price of our products to our customers and, in some instances, affected our ability to be competitive. For our NobelClad business, this impacts our ability to compete on international projects and negatively impacts U.S. fabricators, which are the primary consumers of NobelClad products. Although some of these tariffs have been subsequently reduced or eliminated, as occurred in connection with the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA), many tariffs continue to exist and new tariffs have been and may be imposed at any time. The prolonged duration of tariffs, the imposition of additional tariffs and the risk of potential broader global trade conflicts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Failure to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our current operations.Our continued success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical employees. The loss of services of certain of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such individuals on acceptable terms, if at all, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.A failure in our information technology systems or those of third parties, including those caused by security breaches, cyber-attacks or data protection failures, could disrupt our business, damage our reputation and cause losses.We are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our operations. Our information technology systems are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and banking information and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, theft, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.19Table of ContentsWe outsource certain technology and business process functions to third parties and may increasingly do so in the future. If we do not effectively develop, implement and monitor our outsourcing strategy, third party providers do not perform as anticipated or we experience technological or other problems with a transition, we may not realize productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and loss of business. Our outsourcing of certain technology and business processes functions to third parties may expose us to enhanced risks related to data security, which could result in monetary and reputational damages. In addition, our ability to receive services from third party providers may be impacted by cultural differences, political instability, and unanticipated regulatory requirements or policies. As a result, our ability to conduct our business may be adversely affected.The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. We are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state laws and non-U.S. laws and regulations governing the protection of personal and confidential information of our customers and employees. In particular, the European Union (“E.U.”) has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which contains numerous requirements that must be complied with when handling the personal data of E.U.-based data subjects. We are subject to the GDPR with respect to our E.U. operations and employees. The GDPR and similar laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and sometimes conflict. In particular, as the E.U. member states reframe their national legislation to harmonize with the GDPR, we will need to monitor compliance with all relevant E.U. member states' laws and regulations, including where permitted derogations from the GDPR are introduced. In addition, the states of California and Colorado have recently enacted data privacy laws, and such laws may be enacted in other states or at the U.S. federal level.The GDPR, any resultant changes in E.U. member states' national laws and regulations, and existing or new U.S. state or federal data privacy laws and regulations may increase our compliance obligations and may necessitate the review and implementation of policies and processes relating to our collection and use of data. This increase in compliance obligations could also lead to an increase in compliance costs which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any person, including any of our employees or those with whom we share such information, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to our client or employee data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. For example, under the GDPR penalties for noncompliance can be imposed up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of a firm's global annual revenue. In addition, a data breach could result in negative publicity which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.To the extent that we seek to expand our business through acquisitions, we may experience issues in executing acquisitions or integrating acquired operations. From time to time, we examine opportunities to make selective acquisitions in order to increase shareholder return by increasing our total available markets, expanding our existing operations and, potentially, generating synergies. The success of any acquisition depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: •identifying suitable candidates for acquisition and negotiating acceptable terms; •obtaining approval from regulatory authorities and potentially DMC’s shareholders; •maintaining our financial and strategic focus and avoiding distraction of management during the process of integrating the acquired business; •implementing our standards, controls, procedures and policies at the acquired business and addressing any pre-existing liabilities or claims involving the acquired business; and •to the extent the acquired operations are in a country in which we have not operated historically, understanding the regulations and challenges of operating in that new jurisdiction.For example, our due diligence process may not reveal all liabilities associated with a potential acquisition, and this could result in us incurring unanticipated losses after the acquisition is completed. There can be no assurance that we will be able to conclude any acquisitions successfully or that any acquisition will achieve the anticipated synergies or other positive results. Any material problems that we encounter in connection with such an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. If we fail to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results in a timely and reliable manner, which could harm our business and impact the value of our securities.We depend on our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements in order to run our business. If we fail to do so, our business could be negatively affected and our independent registered public accounting firm may be unable to attest to 20Table of Contentsthe fair presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be harmed. Even effective internal controls have inherent limitations including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or a deterioration in the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures.If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls, including any failure to implement new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their execution, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In the event that our current internal control practices deteriorate, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and investor confidence and the market price of our stock may be adversely affected.We are subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future. We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to litigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings with other parties. Managing or defending such legal proceedings may result in substantial legal fees, expenses and costs and diversion of management resources. If material litigation is brought against us in the future, a decision adverse to DMC could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. For a more detailed discussion of pending litigation, see Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event of a dispute arising at our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels, or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. Our inability to enforce our rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.Legal and Regulatory RisksOur operations require us to comply with numerous laws and regulations, violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition or cash flows.Our operations are subject to international, regional, national, and local laws and regulations in every place where we operate, relating to matters such as environmental protection, health and safety, labor and employment, import/export controls, currency exchange, bribery and corruption, data privacy and cybersecurity, intellectual property, immigration, and taxation. These laws and regulations are complex, frequently change, and have tended to become more stringent over time. In the event the scope of these laws and regulations expands in the future, the incremental cost of compliance could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.Our international operations are subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations, such as the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other similar laws. We are also subject to trade control regulations and trade sanctions laws that restrict the movement of certain goods to, and certain operations in, various countries or with certain persons. Our ability to transfer people, products and data among certain countries is subject to maintaining required licenses and complying with these laws and regulations.The internal controls, policies and procedures, and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or from material violations of applicable laws and regulations. Any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of anti-bribery, trade control, trade sanctions or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Violations of international and US laws and regulations or the loss of any required licenses may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies or restrictions on business conduct, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. In addition, any major violations could have a significant effect on our reputation and consequently on our ability to win future business and maintain existing customer and supplier relationships.The use of explosives in our manufacturing processes and products subject us to additional environmental, health and safety laws and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities.21Table of ContentsDynaEnergetics’ uses explosive materials in its manufacturing processes and products.  NobelClad’s manufacturing process involves the detonation of large quantities of explosives.  The use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity.  These activities subject us to extensive environmental and health and safety laws and regulations including guidelines and regulations for the purchase, manufacture, handling, transport, storage and use of explosives issued by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety regulations set forth by the U.S. Department of Transportation; the Safety Library Publications of the Institute of Makers of Explosive; and similar guidelines of their European counterparts.  In Germany, the transport, storage and use of explosives is governed by a permit issued under the Explosives Act (Sprengstoffgesetz). Despite our use of specialized facilities to store and handle dangerous materials and our employee training programs, the storage and handling of explosive materials could result in explosive incidents that temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupt our or our customers’ operations or could cause restrictions, delays or cancellations in the delivery of our services. It is possible that such an explosion could result in death or significant injuries to employees and other persons. Material property damage to us, our customers and third parties arising from an explosion or resulting fire could also occur. Any explosion could expose us to adverse publicity and liability for damages or cause production restrictions, delays or cancellations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable requirements or the occurrence of an explosive incident may also result in the loss of our license to store and handle explosives, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions.Demand for our products could be reduced by existing and future legislation, regulations and public sentiment. Regulatory agencies and environmental advocacy groups in the United States, the E.U., and other regions or countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their role in climate change. There is also increased focus, including by governments and our customers, investors and other stakeholders, on these and other sustainability and energy transition matters. Existing or future legislation and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, as well as initiatives by governments, non-governmental organizations, and companies to conserve energy or promote the use of alternative energy sources, and negative attitudes toward or perceptions of fossil fuel products and their relationship to the environment, may significantly curtail demand for and production of oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and thus reduce future demand for our products. In addition, some international, national, state and local governments and agencies have also adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on directly limiting the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing. The U.S. federal government has also recently taken significant actions to restrict or suspend the issuance of oil and gas leases on federal lands, which could have a significant impact on future drilling, completion activity and production. These or similar legislation or regulatory changes could limit oil and gas development, lead to operational delays and increased costs for our customers, and therefore reduce demand for our products. Such reductions in demand for our products may, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Increased negative investor sentiment toward oil and gas and preference for assets outside of traditional energy sectors could lead to higher capital costs for our customers and reduced investment in fossil fuels, thereby reducing demand for our products. Such preferences could also impact our ability to obtain acceptable debt or equity financing on attractive terms or at all and could negatively impact our stock price over time. Our business, reputation and demand for our stock could be negatively affected if we do not (or are perceived to not) act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters.Liabilities for natural resource damages, cleanup costs, and other damages under environmental, health and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. We are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulation in the United States and the other countries where our manufacturing facilities are located including those covering hazardous materials. We and all of our activities in the United States are subject to noise abatement and air emissions regulations, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, regulations issued and laws enforced by the labor and employment departments of the U.S. and the states in which we conduct business, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In Germany, we and all our activities are subject to various safety and environmental regulations of the federal state which are enforced by the local authorities, including the Federal Act on Emission Control (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz). The Federal Act on Emission Control permits are held by companies jointly owned by DynaEnergetics and the other companies that are located at the Troisdorf manufacturing site and are for an indefinite period of time. The Dillenburg, Germany facility is 22Table of Contentsoperated based on a specific permit granted by the local mountain authority and must be renewed every three years. Any failure to comply with current and future environmental and safety regulations could subject us to significant liabilities. Any actual or alleged violations of environmental, health or safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities or substantial civil or criminal sanctions. In addition, under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our facilities and at third party waste disposal sites, even when such contamination was caused by a predecessor and even when the actions resulting in the contamination were lawful at the time. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage. Accordingly, environmental, health or safety matters may result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.Changes in or interpretation of tax law control could impact the determination of our income tax liabilities for a tax year.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company, the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the TCJA, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements.We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S and have significant intercompany transactions between our affiliates. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the Company. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S., and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial statements.We are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions from time to time. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. The final resolution of any audits or litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made.Intellectual Property RisksOur failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position. The protection of our intellectual property rights is essential to maintaining our competitive position and recognizing the value of our investments in technology and intellectual property in our existing and future products. We rely on trade secret protection for certain aspects of our technology, in part through confidentiality and other written agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties. Through these and other written agreements, we attempt to control access to and distribution of our intellectual property documentation and other proprietary technology information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, former employees, consultants or third parties may, in an unauthorized manner, attempt to use, copy or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property rights or technology or otherwise develop a product with the same functionality as our technology. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights is difficult, and nearly impossible on a worldwide basis. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property rights.We also actively pursue patent protection for our proprietary technology and intellectual property.  The process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and we cannot be certain that any currently pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents, or that, even if patents are issued, they will be respected by third parties.  In addition, our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets, and this could have a similar effect on our competitive position.23Table of ContentsIntellectual property litigation and threats of litigation are becoming more common in the oilfield services industry. We are currently involved and may in the future be involved in litigation, in the United States or abroad, to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to protect our trade secrets and know-how.  These actions commonly result in actions by the affected third parties to establish the invalidity of our patents.  While we intend to prosecute these actions vigorously, there is no guarantee of success, and such effort takes significant financial and time resources from the Company. In the event that one or more of our patents are challenged, a court or the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) may invalidate the patent(s) or determine that the patent(s) is not enforceable, which could harm our competitive position. If our patents are invalidated, or if the scope of the claims in any of these patents is limited by a court or USPTO decision, we could be prevented from pursuing certain litigation matters or licensing the invalidated or limited portion of such patents. Such adverse decisions could negatively impact our future, expected revenue. Patent litigation, if necessary or when instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources.We may incur substantial costs defending against third parties alleging that we infringe their proprietary rights.We are currently involved and may in the future be involved in litigation relating to alleged infringement by us of others’ patents or other intellectual property rights. We have an active ""freedom to operate"" review process for our technology, but there is no assurance that future infringement claims will not be asserted. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core businesses even if we are ultimately successful. In the event of any adverse ruling in any intellectual property litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacturing, use and sale of infringing products, discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain a license from the third party claiming infringement with royalty payment obligations by us. We also have certain indemnification obligations to customers with respect to the infringement of third party intellectual property rights by our products, which may increase our costs. Any of these occurrences could significantly harm our competitive position, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Risk Factors
 Related to Our Common StockThe price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile, which may make it difficult for you to resell the common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive. The market price and trading volume of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations due to general stock market conditions and/or a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations, business prospects or liquidity. Among the factors that could affect the price of our common stock are: •changes in the oil and gas, industrial, or infrastructure markets; •operating and financial performance that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts or investors; •developments in our business or in our business sectors generally; •regulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations; •the operating and stock price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;•announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors;•our ability to integrate and operate the companies and the businesses that we acquire; •rumors and market speculation regarding our industries, business or trading activity;•significant amounts of short selling, the perception that short sales could occur and other speculative trading activity; •activism by any large stockholder or group of stockholders;•changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, including volatility in foreign exchange rates, tariffs and stock, commodity, credit or asset valuations, and federal government actions or shutdowns.The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has at times been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies, and these fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the trading prices of some companies’ stock have recently exhibited significant volatility, including rapid price and daily volume increases as a result of strong and atypical interest from retail investors, reportedly due in part to a high volume of social media posts, followed by significant declines in the trading prices of the stock. Our stock is historically subject to significant fluctuations, which can be caused by a myriad of known or unknown reasons. While an increase in our stock price may be attributable, in whole or in part, to market developments such as increased commodity prices and/or improving conditions in our core markets, we cannot rule out the possibility that it resulted in whole or in part from market phenomena such as a surge in investor interest or a “short squeeze”, in which investors are driving up our share price in hopes that other investors holding short positions are required to buy shares at higher prices to cover their positions. In this case, those market phenomena could reverse themselves at any time, leading to a rapid and substantial decline in the price of our stock.24Table of ContentsHolders of our common stock do not currently receive dividends and our dividend may not be reinstated in the future.   Our Board of Directors suspended our dividend in April 2020 in order to preserve liquidity in light of the sharp reduction in demand for DynaEnergetics products and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors declares out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and there can be no assurance as to whether the Board will reinstate a dividend in the future"
15,BOOM,DMC GLOBAL INC,2020-02-24,"ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
 Please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make our business and an investment in our securities subject to risk. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. In addition, the global economic climate amplifies many of these risks.Risk Factors
 Related to DynaEnergeticsDemand for DynaEnergetics’ products is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry. Decreases or expected decreases in oil and gas prices and reduced expenditures in the oil and gas industry could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.11Table of ContentsDemand for the majority of our products depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry’s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. In the fourth quarter of 2019, there was a steep decline in North American completion activity and lower expenditures by the oil and gas industry, and E&P companies are under increasing pressure from investors to reduce their cost of operations. If these trends continue or result in a more marked downturn, we would expect continued reduced or delayed oil and gas exploration and production spending, project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us, all of which could result in reduced demand for our products, downward pressure on selling prices for our products and decreased revenues and profits. These effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and can be affected by a variety of factors, including:  • demand for hydrocarbons, which is affected by general economic, business and regulatory conditions;• the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels for oil;• oil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries;• the level of excess production capacity;• political and economic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest;• the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and production activity;• access to potential resources;• governmental policies and subsidies;• the costs of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;• technological advances affecting energy consumption; and• weather conditions.Failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customers demand could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing, internal fabrication utilization and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customer requirements. Factors that can impact our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements include the short-term nature of many customers’ commitments, our customers’ ability to reschedule, cancel and modify orders with little or no notice and without significant penalty, the accuracy of our customers’ forecasts, and seasonal or cyclical trends in customers' industries. To ensure availability of our products, particularly for our largest customers, we may start manufacturing our relevant products based on our customers’ forecasts, which are not binding. As a result, we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales that may never materialize or which may be substantially lower than expected. If actual demand for our products is lower than forecast, we may also experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and product obsolescence. Because certain of our sales, research and development, and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income. Conversely, customers often require rapid increases in production on short notice. We may be unable to secure sufficient materials or contract manufacturing capacity to meet such increases in demand. This could damage our customer relationships, reduce revenue growth and margins, subject us to additional liabilities, harm our reputation, and prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities.Failure to manage periods of growth or contraction may seriously harm our business.Our industry frequently sees periods of expansion and contraction to adjust to customers’ needs and market demands. We regularly contend with these issues and must carefully manage our business to meet customer and market requirements. If we fail to manage these growth and contraction decisions effectively, we may find ourselves with either excess or insufficient resources and our business and our profitability could suffer as a result.Periods of contraction or reduced net sales, or other factors affecting particular markets, create other challenges. We must determine whether facilities remain viable, whether staffing levels need to be reduced, and how to respond to changing levels 12Table of Contentsof customer demand. While maintaining excess capacity or higher levels of employment entails short-term costs, reductions in capacity or employment could impair our ability to respond to new opportunities and programs, market improvements or to maintain customer relationships. Our decisions to reduce costs and capacity can affect our short-term and long-term results and result in restructuring charges.Expansions, including the transfer of operations to other facilities or the construction of new manufacturing facilities such as the recently completed Blum expansion, include the risk of additional costs and start-up inefficiencies. If we are unable to effectively manage our expansion projects or related anticipated net sales are not realized, our operating results could be materially adversely affected. Risks of future expansions include:    •difficulties in the timing of expansions, including delays in the implementation of construction and manufacturing plans;•the inability to successfully integrate additional facilities or incremental capacity and to realize anticipated efficiencies, economies of scale or other value;•challenges faced as a result of transitioning programs;•additional fixed or other costs, or selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses, which may not be fully absorbed by the new business;•a reduction of our return on invested capital, including as a result of excess inventory or excess capacity at new facilities;•diversion of management’s attention from other business areas during the planning and implementation of expansions;•increased debt levels and borrowing costs;•strain placed on our operational, financial and other systems and resources; and•inability to locate sufficient employees or management talent to support the expansion.If we are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, and technology trends, our business and consolidated results of operations and the value of our intellectual property could be materially and adversely affected. The market for our products is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better and more reliable performance and enhanced product offerings. If we are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, and technology trends, our business and consolidated results of operations and the value of our intellectual property could be materially and adversely affected. Likewise, if our proprietary technologies, equipment, facilities, or work processes become obsolete, we may no longer be competitive, and our business and consolidated results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.The manufacturing of explosives subjects DynaEnergetics to various environmental, health and safety laws and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities.DynaEnergetics’ operations include the licensing, storage and handling of explosive materials. Despite our use of specialized facilities to store and handle dangerous materials and our employee training programs, the storage and handling of explosive materials could result in explosive incidents that temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupt our or our customers’ operations or could cause restrictions, delays or cancellations in the delivery of our services. It is possible that such an explosion could result in death or significant injuries to employees and other persons. Material property damage to us, our customers and third parties arising from an explosion or resulting fire could also occur. Any explosion could expose us to adverse publicity and liability for damages or cause production restrictions, delays or cancellations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable requirements or the occurrence of an explosive incident may also result in the loss of our license to store and handle explosives, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions.Consolidation of our customers and competitors may impact our results of operations.The oil and gas industry has experienced periods of consolidation in the past. Industry consolidation may result in reduced capital spending by some of our customers, the acquisition of one or more of our primary customers or competitors or consolidated entities using size and purchasing power to seek pricing or other concessions, which may lead to decreased demand for our products and services. In addition, recent, ongoing and future mergers, combinations and consolidations in our industry could result in existing competitors increasing their market share and may result in stronger competitors. As a result, industry consolidation may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.13Table of ContentsWe may not be able to continue to compete successfully against other companies in our industry.The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. DynaEnergetics competes with a broad spectrum of companies that produce and market perforating services and products. Many of these companies are large national and multi-national companies, including the oil and natural gas industry’s largest oilfield service providers. These companies have longer operating histories, greater financial, technical, and other resources, and greater name recognition than we do. In addition, we compete with many smaller companies capable of competing effectively on a regional or local basis. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. To remain competitive, DynaEnergetics must continue to provide innovative products and maintain an excellent reputation for value, quality, on-time delivery, and safety. If we fail to compete successfully against our competition, we may be unable to maintain acceptable sales levels, prices and margins for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Risk Factors
 Related to NobelCladNobelClad’s business is dependent on sales to a limited number of customers in cyclical markets and our results are affected by the price of metals. NobelClad revenues are affected both by the demand for NobelClad’s explosion-welded cladding services and the base price of metal used in explosion-welded cladding operations. The explosion-welded cladding market is dependent upon sales of products for use by customers in a limited number of heavy industries, including oil and gas, chemicals and petrochemicals, alternative energy, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, rail car manufacturing, power generation, and industrial refrigeration. These industries tend to be cyclical in nature and an economic slowdown in one or all of these industries-whether due to traditional cyclicality, general economic conditions or other factors-could impact capital expenditures within that industry. In addition, metals prices affect the demand for cladded products and our margins. Higher metal prices increase demand by making it more economical for customers to use cladding on less-expensive metal than using solid metal plates. Higher metal prices also lead to higher sales (in terms of dollars rather than square meters of cladding) and generally higher margins for NobelClad. We have experienced a significant decline in the demand for clad products in recent years due in part to a low-metals price environment. If demand or metals prices do not increase or decline further, our sales would be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our backlog figures may not accurately predict future sales.We use backlog to predict our anticipated future sales. Our year-end backlog was $31.7 million, $29.9 million, and $37.5 million at the end of fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We define “backlog” at any given point in time to consist of all firm, unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time. We expect to fill most items of backlog within the following 12 months. However, since orders may be rescheduled or canceled and a significant portion of our net sales is derived from a small number of customers, backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels. Moreover, we cannot be sure of when during the future 12-month period we will be able to recognize revenue corresponding to our backlog nor can we be certain that revenues corresponding to our backlog will not fall into periods beyond the 12-month horizon. There is a limited availability of sites suitable for cladding operations.Our cladding process involves the detonation of large amounts of explosives. As a result, the sites where we perform cladding must meet certain criteria, including adequate distance from densely populated areas, specific geological characteristics, and the ability to comply with local noise and vibration abatement regulations in conducting the process. Our shooting sites in Pennsylvania and in Dillenburg, Germany are located in mines. Access to our Dillenburg mine is subject to a lease that expires in 2022, and if we are unable to negotiate a suitable extension of the lease, this could impact our operations. If a mine were seriously damaged, we might not be able to locate a suitable replacement site in a timely manner to continue our operations. In addition, our Pennsylvania shooting site is subleased under an arrangement pursuant to which we provide certain contractual services to the sub-landlord. The efforts to identify alternative suitable sites and obtain permits for using the sites from local government agencies can be time-consuming and may not be successful. In addition, we could experience difficulty in obtaining or renewing permits because of resistance from residents in the vicinity of existing or proposed sites. The failure to obtain required governmental approvals or permits could limit our ability to expand our cladding business in the future, and the failure to maintain such permits or satisfy other conditions to use the sites would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.There is no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully against other manufacturers of competitive products.14Table of ContentsOur explosion-welded clad products compete on a worldwide basis with explosion-welded clad products made by other manufacturers in the clad metal business and with products manufactured using other technologies. We see competition from one large well-known clad supplier and from a growing number of smaller companies with explosion welded clad manufacturing capability in China and India. Explosion-welded clad products also compete with products manufactured by roll bond and weld overlay cladding processes. The technical and commercial niches of each cladding process are well understood within the industry and vary from one world market location to another and at different metal prices. We focus on reliability, product quality, on-time delivery performance, and low-cost manufacturing to minimize the potential of future competitive threats. However, there is no guarantee we will be able to maintain our competitive position.We do not maintain a reserve fund for warranty or defective products claims. Our costs could substantially increase if we experience a large claim or a significant number of warranty claims.  Our product warranties against technical defects of our clad products vary depending on our purchase orders with customers. The warranties require us to repair or replace defective products and may require the payment of a certain percentage of the purchase price as liquidated damages for our failure to meet the specified product specifications and delivery requirements. In addition, our clad products are often used as part of larger projects or are used in potentially hazardous applications that can cause injury or loss of life and damage to property or equipment. In the event of a product defect, we may be named as a defendant in product liability or other lawsuits asserting potentially large claims. We cannot guarantee that insurance will be available or adequate to cover any or all liabilities incurred. We have not established any reserve funds for potential warranty claims since historically we have experienced few warranty claims for our products so that the costs associated with our warranty claims have been low. If we experience an increase in warranty claims or if our repair and replacement costs associated with warranty claims increase significantly, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.The use of explosives subjects us to additional regulation, and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities.Our operations involve the detonation of large amounts of explosives. The use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity. As a result, we are required to use specific safety precautions under U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration guidelines and guidelines of similar entities in Germany. These include precautions which must be taken to protect employees from exposure to sound and ground vibration, falling debris associated with the detonation of explosives, and emissions resulting from the detonation of explosives. There is a risk that an accident or death could occur in one of our facilities.  Explosions, even if occurring as intended, can lead to damage to the shooting site or manufacturing facility or to equipment used at the facility or injury or death to persons at the facility. Any accident could result in significant manufacturing delays, disruption of operations or claims for damages resulting from death or injuries, which could result in decreased sales and increased expenses. To date, we have not incurred any significant delays, disruptions or claims resulting from accidents at our facilities. If an accident occurred, we might be required to suspend our operations for a period of time while an investigation is undertaken or repairs are made. Such a delay might impact our ability to meet the demand for our products.NobelClad’s customers use some of its products in potentially hazardous applications that can cause injury or loss of life and damage to property or equipment. We cannot be certain that our products will be completely free from defects, and we could be named as a defendant in product liability or other lawsuits asserting potentially large claims if an accident involving our product occurs, whether or not any defect in our products exists. In addition, we cannot guarantee that insurance will be available or adequate to cover any or all liabilities incurred. Customers have the right to change orders until products are completed.Customers have the right to change orders after they have been placed. If orders are changed, the extra expenses associated with the change usually will be passed on to the customer. However, because a change in an order may delay completion of the project, recognition of income for the project may also be delayed. Additionally, any errors or changes as to specifications or significant changes in pricing or availability of materials may cause cost overruns and delays in completion of projects. If we fail to meet delivery schedules, we may be required to pay damages or may risk loss of an order, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Risk Factors
 Related to our Businesses Generally15Table of ContentsOur operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter.We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in annual and quarterly operating results caused by various factors at both NobelClad and DynaEnergetics. At NobelClad, quarterly sales and operating results depend on the volume and timing of the orders in our backlog as well as bookings during the quarter. At DynaEnergetics, the level of demand from our customers is impacted by oil and gas prices as well as a variety of other factors and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Significant portions of our operating expenses are fixed, and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts and product development programs. If sales do not meet our expectations in any given period, the adverse impact on operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust operating expenses sufficiently or quickly enough to compensate for such a shortfall. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results for any future period. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock.  We are exposed to potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against the currencies of many of our operating subsidiaries. Many of our operating subsidiaries conduct business in euros, Canadian dollars, or other foreign currencies. Sales made in currencies other than U.S. dollars accounted for 12%, 21%, and 28% of total sales for the years ended 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of any of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience foreign currency translation (gains) losses with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. In addition, our company and our operating subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we or they enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or their respective functional currencies. For example, DynaEnergetics Europe's functional currency is euros, but its sales often occur in U.S. dollars. Changes in exchange rates with respect to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. In addition, we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to our operating subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities and to the financial results of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of equity. Our primary exposure to foreign currency risk is the euro, due to the percentage of our U.S. dollar revenue that is derived from countries where the euro is the functional currency. We use foreign currency forward contracts, generally with maturities of one month, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated asset and liability account balances. These hedge transactions relate to our operating entities with significant economic exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. Our primary economic exposures include the U.S. dollar to the euro, the U.S. dollar to the Canadian dollar, and the euro to the U.S. Dollar. Since the underlying balance sheet account balances being hedged can fluctuate significantly throughout our monthly hedge periods, our hedging program cannot fully protect against foreign currency fluctuations.Disruptions or delays involving our suppliers or increases in prices for the components, raw materials and parts that we obtain from our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations.Our operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the components, raw materials and parts that we need to manufacture our products.  In some instances, we purchase components, raw materials and parts that are ultimately derived from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. Any number of factors, including labor disruptions, military activity, catastrophic weather events, the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness,(such as the coronavirus), contractual or other disputes, unfavorable economic or industry conditions, delivery delays or other performance problems or financial difficulties or solvency problems, could disrupt our suppliers’ operations and lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions for us, which could, in turn, disrupt our operations.  In particular, if the current coronavirus outbreak continues and results in a prolonged period of travel, commercial and other similar restrictions, we could experience global supply disruptions.  If we experience supply disruptions, we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly. Any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of components, raw materials or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules or suspend production entirely, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.The terms of our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants, the breach of any of which could result in acceleration of payment of our credit facilities.As of December 31, 2019, we had an outstanding balance of approximately $14.9 million on our syndicated credit agreement. This agreement includes various covenants and restrictions and certain of these relate to the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the mortgaging, pledging or disposing of major assets. We are also required to maintain certain financial 16Table of Contentsratios on a quarterly basis. A breach of any of these covenants could impair our ability to borrow and could result in acceleration of our obligations to repay our debt, if we are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment from our lenders. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and other provisions of the credit agreement and our other loan agreements. Any failure to remain in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our credit agreement could result in a default, which would, absent a waiver or amendment, require immediate repayment of outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities.We are dependent on a relatively small number of large projects and customers for a significant portion of our net sales.A significant portion of our net sales is derived from a relatively small number of projects and customers; therefore, the failure to complete existing contracts on a timely basis, to receive payment for such services in a timely manner, or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect our ability to meet cash requirements exclusively through operating activities. We attempt to minimize the risk of losing customers or specific contracts by continually improving commercial execution, product quality, delivering product on time and competing aggressively on the basis of price. We expect to continue to depend upon our principal customers for a significant portion of our sales, although our principal customers may not continue to purchase products and services from us at current levels, if at all. The loss of one or more major customers or a change in their buying patterns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We are susceptible to the cyclicality of the steel industry. Steel plate and steel pipe are key materials used our NobelClad and DynaEnergetics’ businesses. The steel industry is very cyclical and is affected significantly by supply and demand factors, general economic conditions and other factors such as worldwide production capacity, fluctuations in steel imports/exports, tariffs and quotas. The downturn in the U.S. economy in fiscal 2010 and the continued low metals prices since that time have had an adverse effect on the U.S. steel industry and on our NobelClad business, and any future economic downturn or a prolonged period of stagnation in the economy could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Tariffs imposed by the U.S. government and related counter tariffs have increased our costs, limited the availability of metals and may lead to further trade conflicts.In 2018, the U.S. announced tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum imported from countries where we typically source metals. These tariffs were met with retaliatory tariffs from certain countries and increased, broader tariffs were levied by the U.S. on targeted countries, including China. The tariffs impacted the cost of the importation of steel, which we utilize in our steel plate and steel pipe, key materials in our NobelClad and DynaEnergetics businesses. Though in many cases we have been able to source metals from domestic suppliers, some materials are only available from sources subject to tariffs.  The cost of domestic steel and aluminum has also increased, along with the price of delivery, and the availability of certain materials has been limited. These increased costs have increased the price of our products to our customers and, in some instances, our ability to be competitive. For our NobelClad business, this impacts our ability to compete on international projects and negatively impacts U.S. fabricators, which are strong consumers of NobelClad products. Although some of these tariffs have been subsequently reduced or eliminated, as occurred in connection with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico and with NAFTA's proposed replacement, the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA), many tariffs continue to exist and new tariffs have been and may be imposed at any time. The prolonged duration of tariffs, the imposition of additional tariffs and the risk of potential broader global trade conflicts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.If our customers delay paying or fail to pay a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. We depend on a limited number of significant customers, and the loss of one or more significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated results of operations.In most cases, we bill our customers for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to the risk that our customers will delay payment of or fail to pay our invoices. In weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers’ cash flow from operations and their access to the credit markets and rising interest rates. If our customers delay paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.17Table of ContentsFailure to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our current operations.Our continued success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical employees. The loss of services of certain of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such individuals on acceptable terms, if at all, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We are subject to extensive government regulation and failure to comply could subject us to future liabilities and could adversely affect our ability to conduct or to expand our business.We are subject to extensive government regulation in the United States, Germany, and Canada, including guidelines and regulations for the purchase, manufacture, handling, transport, storage and use of explosives issued by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety regulations set forth by the U.S. Department of Transportation; the Safety Library Publications of the Institute of Makers of Explosive; and similar guidelines of their European counterparts. In Germany, the transport, storage and use of explosives is governed by a permit issued under the Explosives Act (Sprengstoffgesetz). Our shooting sites located in Pennsylvania and in Dillenburg, Germany are located in mines, which subject us to certain regulations and oversight of governmental agencies that oversee mines.We are also subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulation, as described below under “Liabilities for natural resource damages, cleanup costs, and other damages under environmental, health and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition” and above under “The use of explosives subjects us to additional regulation, and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities.”In addition, the shipment of goods, services, and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Our import activities are governed by the unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate. Moreover, many countries, including the United States, control the export and re-export of certain goods, services and technology and impose related export recordkeeping and reporting obligations. Governments may also impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons, and entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities, which may limit or prevent our conduct of business in certain jurisdictions. The laws and regulations concerning import activity, export recordkeeping and reporting, export control, and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing. Changes in these laws and regulations or in related banking compliance programs and practices can cause delays in shipments or require us to cancel orders or restrict our ability to receive payments on certain orders. Moreover, any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory trading obligations could result in criminal and civil penalties and sanctions, such as fines, imprisonment, debarment from governmental contracts, seizure of shipments and loss of import and export privileges. Any failure to comply with current and future regulations in the countries where we operate could subject us to future liabilities. In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities, construct new facilities, or compete in certain markets or could require us to incur significant expenses in order to maintain compliance. Accordingly, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected by our non-compliance with applicable regulations, by any significant limitations on our business as a result of our inability to comply with applicable regulations, or by any requirement that we spend substantial amounts of capital to comply with such regulations.Demand for our products and services could be reduced by existing and future legislation or regulations.Environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the United States and other countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their potential role in climate change. Existing or future legislation and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, as well as government initiatives to conserve energy or promote the use of alternative energy sources, may significantly curtail demand for and production of fossil fuels such as oil and gas and, thus, adversely affect future demand for our products. This may, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Some international, national, state and local governments and agencies have also adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing. For example, in November 2018, voters in Colorado defeated a ""setback"" initiative, Proposition 112. Proposition 112 would have amended the Oil and Gas Conservation Act and prohibited the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission from 18Table of Contentspermitting new oil and gas development closer than 2,500 feet from occupied structures or other areas such as playgrounds, parks, public open space and certain bodies of water. If Proposition 112 had passed, it would have significantly impacted the oil and gas industry in Colorado. Since Proposition 112’s defeat, new oil and gas legislation has been adopted (Colorado SB-181) by the state legislature which could significantly impact new projects in Colorado and multiple additional ballot initiatives similar to Proposition 112 are being threatened. Future hydraulic fracturing-related legislation or regulations could limit or ban hydraulic fracturing, or lead to operational delays and increased costs, and therefore reduce demand for our products. If such additional international, national, state or local legislation or regulations are enacted, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our operations are subject to political and economic instability and risk of government actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. We are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries in which we operate. Our operations are subject to various risks unique to each country that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. With respect to any particular country, these risks may include:•political and economic instability, including:    ◦civil unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war, other armed conflict, and sanctions;◦inflation; and◦currency fluctuations, devaluations, conversion, or repatriation restrictions; and•governmental actions that may:    ◦result in expropriation and nationalization of our assets in that country;◦result in confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies;◦limit extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing;◦limit or disrupt markets or our operations, restrict payments, or limit the movement of funds;◦result in increased tariffs;◦impose trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions;◦increase borrowing costs;◦result in the deprivation of contract rights; and◦result in the inability to obtain or retain licenses required for operation.Liabilities for natural resource damages, cleanup costs, and other damages under environmental, health and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. We are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulation in the United States and the other countries where our manufacturing facilities are located including those covering hazardous materials. We and all of our activities in the United States are subject noise abatement and air emissions regulations, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, regulations issued and laws enforced by the labor and employment departments of the U.S. and the states in which we conduct business, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In Germany, we and all our activities are subject to various safety and environmental regulations of the federal state which are enforced by the local authorities, including the Federal Act on Emission Control (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz). The Federal Act on Emission Control permits are held by companies jointly owned by DynaEnergetics and the other companies that are located at the Troisdorf manufacturing site and are for an indefinite period of time. The Dillenburg, Germany facility is operated based on a specific permit granted by the local mountain authority and must be renewed every three years. Any failure to comply with current and future environmental and safety regulations could subject us to significant liabilities. Any actual or alleged violations of environmental, health or safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities or substantial civil or criminal sanctions. In addition, under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our facilities and at third party waste disposal sites, even when such contamination was caused by a predecessor and even when the actions resulting in the contamination were lawful at the time. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage. Accordingly, environmental, health or safety matters may result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.Our failure to comply with Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other laws could have a negative impact on our ongoing operations.We are subject to complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, and various other anti-bribery and anticorruption laws. The internal controls, policies and procedures, and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees, 19Table of Contentscontractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations. Any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Violations of international and U.S. laws and regulations may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, and restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business, operating results and financial condition.Changes in or interpretation of tax law and currency/repatriation control could impact the determination of our income tax liabilities for a tax year. We have worldwide operations. Consequently, we are subject to the jurisdiction of a significant number of taxing authorities. The income earned in these various jurisdictions is taxed on differing bases, including net income actually earned, net income deemed earned, and revenue-based tax withholding. The final determination of our income tax liabilities involves the interpretation of local tax laws, tax treaties, and related authorities in each jurisdiction, as well as the use of estimates and assumptions regarding the scope of future operations and results achieved and the timing and nature of income earned and expenditures incurred. Changes in the operating environment, including changes in or interpretation of tax law and currency/repatriation controls, could impact the determination of our income tax liabilities for a tax year in a manner that is adverse to us.The enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities, the adoption of other corporate tax reform policies, or changes in tax legislation or policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.Corporate tax reform, base-erosion prevention efforts and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many tax jurisdictions where we have business operations. As a result, policies regarding corporate income and other taxes in numerous jurisdictions are under heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation is being proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions. For example, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""TCJA""), among other things, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate and imposed base-erosion prevention measures on non-U.S. earnings of U.S. entities as well as a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated non-U.S. earnings of U.S. entities. The TCJA will affect the tax position reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and our obligations for cash taxes of our U.S. entities and has had a corresponding impact on our consolidated financial results starting in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018.In addition, many countries are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including through changes to cross-border tax, transfer-pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. As a result of the heightened scrutiny of corporate taxation policies, prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities, and legislative investigation and inquiry, which could also result in changes to tax policies or prior tax rulings. Any such changes in policies or rulings may also result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change.Due to the large scale of our international business activities any substantial changes in international corporate tax policies, enforcement activities or legislative initiatives may materially and adversely affect our business, the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our financial condition and results of operations generally.Work stoppages and other labor relations matters may make it substantially more difficult or expensive for us to produce our products, which could result in decreased sales or increased costs, either of which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to the risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters, particularly in Germany and France, where some of our employees are unionized. The employees at our U.S. manufacturing facilities are not unionized. Any prolonged work stoppage or strike at any one of our principal facilities could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future.   We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to litigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings with other parties. Managing or defending such legal proceedings may result in substantial legal fees, expenses and costs and diversion of management resources. If material litigation is brought against us in the future, a decision adverse to DMC could have a 20Table of Contentsmaterial adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. For a more detailed discussion of pending litigation, see Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.   In the event of a dispute arising at our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels, or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. Our inability to enforce our rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Our failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position. We rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our products and services. We may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future, and these rights could be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our products and services may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Our failure to protect our proprietary information could materially and adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets, and this could have a similar effect on our competitive position.We may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights.Tools, techniques, methodologies, technology, programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe, or be alleged to infringe, upon the intellectual property rights of others. We have an active ""freedom to operate"" review process for our technology, but there is no assurance that future infringement claims will not be asserted. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core businesses even if we are ultimately successful. In the event of any adverse ruling in any intellectual property litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacturing, use and sale of infringing products, discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain a license from the third party claiming infringement with royalty payment obligations by us. We also have certain indemnification obligations to customers with respect to the infringement of third party intellectual property rights by our products, which may increase our costs. A failure in our information technology systems or those of third parties, including those caused by security breaches, cyber-attacks or data protection failures, could disrupt our business, damage our reputation and cause losses.We are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our operations. Our information technology systems are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, theft, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.We outsource certain technology and business process functions to third parties and may increasingly do so in the future. If we do not effectively develop, implement and monitor our outsourcing strategy, third party providers do not perform as anticipated or we experience technological or other problems with a transition, we may not realize productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and loss of business. Our outsourcing of certain technology and business processes functions to third parties may expose us to enhanced risks related to data security, which could result in monetary and reputational damages. In addition, our ability to receive services from third party providers may be impacted by cultural differences, political instability, and unanticipated regulatory requirements or policies. As a result, our ability to conduct our business may be adversely affected.The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. We are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state laws and non-U.S. laws and regulations governing the protection of personal and confidential information of our customers and employees. In particular, the European Union (“E.U.”) has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which contains numerous requirements that must be complied with when handling the 21Table of Contentspersonal data of E.U.-based data subjects. We are subject to the GDPR with respect to our E.U. operations and employees. The GDPR and similar laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and sometimes conflict. In particular, as the E.U. states reframe their national legislation to harmonize with the GDPR, we will need to monitor compliance with all relevant E.U. member states' laws and regulations, including where permitted derogations from the GDPR are introduced. In addition, the states of California and Colorado have recently enacted data privacy laws, and such laws may be enacted in other states or at the U.S. federal level.The GDPR, any resultant changes in E.U. member states' national laws and regulations, and existing or new U.S. state or federal data privacy laws and regulations may increase our compliance obligations and may necessitate the review and implementation of policies and processes relating to our collection and use of data. This increase in compliance obligations could also lead to an increase in compliance costs which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any person, including any of our employees or those with whom we share such information, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to our client or employee data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. For example, under the GDPR penalties for noncompliance can be imposed up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of a firm's global annual revenue. In addition, a data breach could result in negative publicity which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.To the extent that we seek to expand our business through acquisitions, we may experience issues in executing acquisitions or integrating acquired operations.   From time to time, we examine opportunities to make selective acquisitions in order to increase shareholder return by increasing our total available markets, expanding our existing operations and, potentially, generating synergies. The success of any acquisition depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:   •identifying suitable candidates for acquisition and negotiating acceptable terms; •obtaining approval from regulatory authorities and potentially DMC’s shareholders; •maintaining our financial and strategic focus and avoiding distraction of management during the process of integrating the acquired business; •implementing our standards, controls, procedures and policies at the acquired business and addressing any pre-existing liabilities or claims involving the acquired business; and •to the extent the acquired operations are in a country in which we have not operated historically, understanding the regulations and challenges of operating in that new jurisdiction.  For example, our due diligence process may not reveal all liabilities associated with a potential acquisition, and this could result in us incurring unanticipated losses after the acquisition is completed. There can be no assurance that we will be able to conclude any acquisitions successfully or that any acquisition will achieve the anticipated synergies or other positive results. Any material problems that we encounter in connection with such an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. If we fail to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results in a timely and reliable manner, which could harm our business and impact the value of our securities.We depend on our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements in order to run our business. If we fail to do so, our business could be negatively affected and our independent registered public accounting firm may be unable to attest to the fair presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be harmed. Even effective internal controls have inherent limitations including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or a deterioration in the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures.If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls, including any failure to implement new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their execution, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse 22Table of Contentseffect on our business and financial results. In the event that our current control practices deteriorate, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and investor confidence and the market price of our stock may be adversely affected.Risk Factors
 Related to Our Common StockThe price of our common stock may be volatile, which may make it difficult for you to resell the common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive.   The market price and volume of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations due to general stock market conditions and/or a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations, business prospects or liquidity. Among the factors that could affect the price of our common stock are: •changes in the oil and gas, industrial, or infrastructure markets; •operating and financial performance that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts or investors; •developments in our business or in our business sectors generally; •regulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations; •the operating and stock price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;•announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors;•our ability to integrate and operate the companies and the businesses that we acquire; and•changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, including volatility in foreign exchange rates, tariffs and stock, commodity, credit or asset valuations, and federal government actions or shutdowns.  The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has at times been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Holders of our common stock may not receive dividends.   Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Under Delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be impaired. Our ability to pay dividends will be subject to our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as our compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future indebtedness. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and our Board of Directors may modify the dividend policy or reduce, defer or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future"

 Risk Factors
 Related to DynaEnergeticsDemand for DynaEnergetics’ products is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry. Decreased oil and gas prices and reduced expenditures in the oil and gas industry could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Demand for the majority of our products depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry’s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. From 2014 through mid-2017, oil and gas prices declined significantly, resulting in lower expenditures by the oil and gas industry during this period. As a result, many of our customers reduced or delayed their oil and gas exploration and production spending, reducing the demand for our products and causing downward pressure on the prices that we charged and the revenues and profits we earned during this period. This resulted in DynaEnergetics’ revenues declined 12.5% in 2016 compared with 2015 and declined 27.0% in 2015 compared with 2014. Although we experienced increased exploration and production spending in 2017 and 2018, including improved revenues and profitability in DynaEnergetics over the past two years, there is no assurance such conditions will continue, particularly because oil prices again declined substantially in late 2018.There can be no assurance that the demand or pricing for oil and natural gas will continue at current levels or follow historic patterns. A decline in oil and gas prices could cause reductions in cash flows for our customers, which could have material adverse effects on the financial condition of our customers. This could result in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us. These effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and can be affected by a variety of factors, including:  • demand for hydrocarbons, which is affected by general economic, business and regulatory conditions;• the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels for oil;• oil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries;• the level of excess production capacity;• political and economic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest;• the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and production activity;• access to potential resources;• governmental policies and subsidies;• the costs of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;• technological advances affecting energy consumption; and• weather conditions.Constraints in the supply of, prices for, and availability of transportation of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations. Our business requires a continuous supply of raw materials, such as explosives, steel, metal powder, and electronics, which normally are readily available. However, shortages of raw materials or long-lead times in receiving such materials, as a result of high levels of demand or loss of suppliers during market challenges, could trigger constraints in the supply chain of 11Table of Contentsthose raw materials, particularly, where we have a relationship with a single supplier for a particular resource. An increase in military activity in certain parts of the world could impact the availability of explosives as capacity could potentially be diverted to supply military requirements. These delays and constraints could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations. In addition, price increases imposed by our vendors for raw materials used in our business and the inability to pass these increases on to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations.Failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customers demand could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing, internal fabrication utilization and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customer requirements. Factors that can impact our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements include the short-term nature of many customers’ commitments, our customers’ ability to reschedule, cancel and modify orders with little or no notice and without significant penalty, the accuracy of our customers’ forecasts, and seasonal or cyclical trends in customers' industries. To ensure availability of our products, particularly for our largest customers, we may start manufacturing our relevant products based on our customers’ forecasts, which are not binding. As a result, we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales that may never materialize or which may be substantially lower than expected. If actual demand for our products is lower than forecast, we may also experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and product obsolescence. Because certain of our sales, research and development, and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income. Conversely, customers often require rapid increases in production on short notice. We may be unable to secure sufficient materials or contract manufacturing capacity to meet such increases in demand. This could damage our customer relationships, reduce revenue growth and margins, subject us to additional liabilities, harm our reputation, and prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities.Failure to manage periods of growth or contraction may seriously harm our business.Our industry frequently sees periods of expansion and contraction to adjust to customers’ needs and market demands. We regularly contend with these issues and must carefully manage our business to meet customer and market requirements. If we fail to manage these growth and contraction decisions effectively, we may find ourselves with either excess or insufficient resources and our business and our profitability could suffer as a result.Expansions, including the transfer of operations to other facilities or the construction of new manufacturing facilities, such as the recently completed Blum expansion, include the risk of additional costs and start-up inefficiencies. If we are unable to effectively manage our expansion projects or related anticipated net sales are not realized, our operating results could be materially adversely affected. Risks of the Blum expansion project and future expansions include:    •increased costs associated with opening new facilities, including the ability to meet budget constraints on construction projects;•difficulties in the timing of expansions, including delays in the implementation of construction and manufacturing plans;•the inability to successfully integrate additional facilities or incremental capacity and to realize anticipated efficiencies, economies of scale or other value;•challenges faced as a result of transitioning programs;•additional fixed or other costs, or selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses, which may not be fully absorbed by the new business;•a reduction of our return on invested capital, including as a result of excess inventory or excess capacity at new facilities;•diversion of management’s attention from other business areas during the planning and implementation of expansions;•increased debt levels and borrowing costs;•strain placed on our operational, financial and other systems and resources; and•inability to locate sufficient employees or management talent to support the expansion.Periods of contraction or reduced net sales, or other factors affecting particular sites, create other challenges. We must determine whether facilities remain viable, whether staffing levels need to be reduced, and how to respond to changing levels 12Table of Contentsof customer demand. While maintaining excess capacity or higher levels of employment entails short-term costs, reductions in capacity or employment could impair our ability to respond to new opportunities and programs, market improvements or to maintain customer relationships. Our decisions to reduce costs and capacity can affect our short-term and long-term results and result in restructuring charges. If we are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, and technology trends, our business and consolidated results of operations and the value of our intellectual property could be materially and adversely affected. The market for our products is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better and more reliable performance. If we are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, and technology trends, our business and consolidated results of operations and the value of our intellectual property could be materially and adversely affected. Likewise, if our proprietary technologies, equipment, facilities, or work processes become obsolete, we may no longer be competitive, and our business and consolidated results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.The manufacturing of explosives subjects DynaEnergetics to various environmental, health and safety laws and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities.The use of explosives is inherently dangerous. DynaEnergetics is subject to a number of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations covering all aspects of the business including general operating licenses, transportation domestically and internationally, storage requirements, waste disposal, manufacturing regulations, employee training and certification requirements, and labor regulations. Violation of these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties or in interruption of our business activities. DynaEnergetics’ success depends on continued compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, new environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could be passed that could create costly compliance issues. While DynaEnergetics endeavors to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, compliance with future laws and regulations may not be economically feasible or even possible. Even with compliance with applicable health and safety laws, it is possible that accidents may occur, potentially resulting in injury to our employees, equipment, facilities, and customers. Any accident could result in significant manufacturing delays, disruption of operations or legal claims for damages resulting from death or injuries, which could result in decreased sales and increased expenses.We may not be able to continue to compete successfully against other perforating companies.DynaEnergetics competes principally with perforating companies based in North America, South America, and Russia, which produce and market perforating services and products. DynaEnergetics also competes with oil and gas service companies that are able to satisfy a portion of their perforating needs through in-house production. To remain competitive, DynaEnergetics must continue to provide innovative products and maintain an excellent reputation for safety, quality, on-time delivery, and value. There can be no assurances that we will continue to compete successfully against these companies.Risk Factors
 Related to NobelCladNobelClad’s business is dependent on sales to a limited number of customers in cyclical markets and our results are affected by the price of metals. NobelClad revenues are affected both by the demand for NobelClad’s explosion-welded cladding services and the base price of metal used in explosion-welded cladding operations. The explosion-welded cladding market is dependent upon sales of products for use by customers in a limited number of heavy industries, including oil and gas, chemicals and petrochemicals, alternative energy, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, rail car manufacturing, power generation, and industrial refrigeration. These industries tend to be cyclical in nature and an economic slowdown in one or all of these industries-whether due to traditional cyclicality, general economic conditions or other factors-could impact capital expenditures within that industry. In addition, metals prices affect the demand for cladded products and our margins. Higher metal prices increase demand by making it more economical for customers to use cladding on less-expensive metal than using solid metal plates. Higher metal prices also lead to higher sales (in terms of dollars rather than square meters of cladding) and generally higher margins for NobelClad. We have experienced a significant decline in the demand for clad products in recent years due in part to a low-metals price environment. If demand or metals prices do not increase or decline further, our sales would be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our backlog figures may not accurately predict future sales.13Table of ContentsWe use backlog to predict our anticipated future sales. Our year-end backlog was $29.9 million, $37.5 million, and $31.6 million at the end of fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We define “backlog” at any given point in time to consist of all firm, unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time. We expect to fill most items of backlog within the following 12 months. However, since orders may be rescheduled or canceled and a significant portion of our net sales is derived from a small number of customers, backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels. Moreover, we cannot be sure of when during the future 12-month period we will be able to recognize revenue corresponding to our backlog nor can we be certain that revenues corresponding to our backlog will not fall into periods beyond the 12-month horizon. There is a limited availability of sites suitable for cladding operations.Our cladding process involves the detonation of large amounts of explosives. As a result, the sites where we perform cladding must meet certain criteria, including adequate distance from densely populated areas, specific geological characteristics, and the ability to comply with local noise and vibration abatement regulations in conducting the process. Our shooting sites in Pennsylvania and in Dillenburg, Germany are located in mines. We terminated the lease to our secondary shooting site in Tautavel, France in late 2018 associated with the closure of manufacturing operations in France, and we moved all European shooting operations to Dillenburg. This will increase the demands on the Dillenburg mine. Access to our Dillenburg mine is subject to a lease that expires in 2022, and if we are unable to negotiate a suitable extension of the lease, this could impact our operations. If a mine were seriously damaged, we might not be able to locate a suitable replacement site in a timely manner to continue our operations. In addition, our primary U.S. shooting site is subleased under an arrangement pursuant to which we provide certain contractual services to the sub-landlord. The efforts to identify alternative suitable sites and obtain permits for using the sites from local government agencies can be time-consuming and may not be successful. In addition, we could experience difficulty in obtaining or renewing permits because of resistance from residents in the vicinity of existing or proposed sites. The failure to obtain required governmental approvals or permits could limit our ability to expand our cladding business in the future, and the failure to maintain such permits or satisfy other conditions to use the sites would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.There is no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully against other manufacturers of competitive products.Our explosion-welded clad products compete with explosion-welded clad products made by other manufacturers in the clad metal business located throughout the world and with clad products manufactured using other technologies. Our combined North American and European operations typically supply explosion-welded clad to the worldwide market. There is one other well-known explosion-welded clad supplier worldwide - a division of Asahi-Kasei Corporation of Japan. There are also a number of smaller companies worldwide with explosion-welded clad manufacturing capability, including several companies in China and India that appear to be growing significantly in their domestic markets. Explosion-welded clad products also compete with those manufactured by rollbond and weld overlay cladding processes. The technical and commercial niches of each cladding process are well understood within the industry and vary from one world market location to another. We focus on reliability, product quality, on-time delivery performance, and low-cost manufacturing to minimize the potential of future competitive threats. However, there is no guarantee we will be able to maintain our competitive position.We do not maintain a reserve fund for warranty or defective products claims. Our costs could substantially increase if we experience a large claim or a significant number of warranty claims.  Our product warranties against technical defects of our clad products vary depending on our purchase orders with customers. The warranties require us to repair or replace defective products and may require the payment of a certain percentage of the purchase price as liquidated damages for our failure to meet the specified product specifications and delivery requirements. In addition, our clad products are often used as part of larger projects or are used in potentially hazardous applications that can cause injury or loss of life and damage to property or equipment. In the event of a product defect, we may be named as a defendant in product liability or other lawsuits asserting potentially large claims. We cannot guarantee that insurance will be available or adequate to cover any or all liabilities incurred. We have not established any reserve funds for potential warranty claims since historically we have experienced few warranty claims for our products so that the costs associated with our warranty claims have been low. If we experience an increase in warranty claims or if our repair and replacement costs associated with warranty claims increase significantly, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.The use of explosives subjects us to additional regulation, and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities.14Table of ContentsOur operations involve the detonation of large amounts of explosives. The use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity. As a result, we are required to use specific safety precautions under U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration guidelines and guidelines of similar entities in Germany. These include precautions which must be taken to protect employees from exposure to sound and ground vibration or falling debris associated with the detonation of explosives. There is a risk that an accident or death could occur in one of our facilities.  Explosions, even if occurring as intended, can lead to damage to the shooting site or manufacturing facility or to equipment used at the facility or injury or death to persons at the facility. Any accident could result in significant manufacturing delays, disruption of operations or claims for damages resulting from death or injuries, which could result in decreased sales and increased expenses. To date, we have not incurred any significant delays, disruptions or claims resulting from accidents at our facilities. If an accident occurred, we might be required to suspend our operations for a period of time while an investigation is undertaken or repairs are made. Such a delay might impact our ability to meet the demand for our products.The Company’s customers use some of its products in potentially hazardous applications that can cause injury or loss of life and damage to property or equipment. The Company cannot be certain that its products will be completely free from defects. The Company may be named as a defendant in product liability or other lawsuits asserting potentially large claims. In addition, the Company cannot guarantee that insurance will be available or adequate to cover any or all liabilities incurred. Customers have the right to change orders until products are completed.Customers have the right to change orders after they have been placed. If orders are changed, the extra expenses associated with the change usually will be passed on to the customer. However, because a change in an order may delay completion of the project, recognition of income for the project may also be delayed. Additionally, any errors or changes as to specifications or significant changes in pricing or availability of materials may cause cost overruns and delays in completion of projects. If we fail to meet delivery schedules, we may be required to pay damages or may risk loss of an order, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Risk Factors
 Related to our Businesses GenerallyOur operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter.We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in annual and quarterly operating results caused by various factors at both NobelClad and DynaEnergetics. At NobelClad, quarterly sales and operating results depend on the volume and timing of the orders in our backlog as well as bookings during the quarter. At DynaEnergetics, the level of demand from our customers is impacted by oil and gas prices as well as a variety of other factors and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Significant portions of our operating expenses are fixed, and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts and product development programs. If sales do not meet our expectations in any given period, the adverse impact on operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust operating expenses sufficiently or quickly enough to compensate for such a shortfall. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results for any future period. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock.  We are exposed to potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against the currencies of many of our operating subsidiaries. Many of our operating subsidiaries conduct business in euros, Canadian dollars, Russian rubles or other foreign currencies. Sales made in currencies other than U.S. dollars accounted for 21%, 28%, and 23% of total sales for the years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of any of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience foreign currency translation (gains) losses with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. In addition, our company and our operating subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we or they enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or their respective functional currencies. For example, DynaEnergetics KG’s functional currency is euros, but its sales often occur in U.S. dollars. Changes in exchange rates with respect to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. In addition, we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to our operating subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities and to the financial results of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of equity. Our primary exposure to foreign currency risk is the euro, due to the percentage of our U.S. dollar revenue that is derived from countries where the euro is the functional 15Table of Contentscurrency, and the Russian ruble due to our operations in Tyumen, Siberia. During the third quarter of 2017, we began using foreign currency forward contracts, generally with maturities of one month, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated asset and liability account balances. These hedge transactions relate to our operating entities with significant economic exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. Our primary economic exposures include the U.S. dollar to the euro, the U.S. dollar to the Canadian dollar, the euro to the U.S. Dollar and the euro to the Russian ruble. Since the underlying balance sheet account balances being hedged can fluctuate significantly throughout our monthly hedge periods, our hedging program cannot fully protect against foreign currency fluctuations.The terms of our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants, the breach of any of which could result in acceleration of payment of our credit facilities.As of December 31, 2018, we had an outstanding balance of approximately $42.1 million on our syndicated credit agreement. This agreement includes various covenants and restrictions and certain of these relate to the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the mortgaging, pledging or disposing of major assets. We are also required to maintain certain financial ratios on a quarterly basis. A breach of any of these covenants could impair our ability to borrow and could result in acceleration of our obligations to repay our debt, if we are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment from our lenders. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and other provisions of the credit agreement and our other loan agreements. Any failure to remain in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our credit agreement could result in a default, which would, absent a waiver or amendment, require immediate repayment of outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities.We are dependent on a relatively small number of large projects and customers for a significant portion of our net sales.A significant portion of our net sales is derived from a relatively small number of projects and customers; therefore, the failure to complete existing contracts on a timely basis, to receive payment for such services in a timely manner, or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect our ability to meet cash requirements exclusively through operating activities. We attempt to minimize the risk of losing customers or specific contracts by continually improving commercial execution, product quality, delivering product on time and competing aggressively on the basis of price. We expect to continue to depend upon our principal customers for a significant portion of our sales, although our principal customers may not continue to purchase products and services from us at current levels, if at all. The loss of one or more major customers or a change in their buying patterns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We are susceptible to the cyclicality of the steel industry. Steel plate and steel pipe are key materials used our NobelClad and DynaEnergetics’ businesses. The steel industry is very cyclical and is affected significantly by supply and demand factors, general economic conditions and other factors such as worldwide production capacity, fluctuations in steel imports/exports, tariffs and quotas. The downturn in the U.S. economy in fiscal 2010 and the continued low metals prices since that time have had an adverse effect on the U.S. steel industry and on our NobelClad business and any future economic downturn or a prolonged period of stagnation in the economy could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Tariffs imposed by the U.S. government and related counter tariffs have increased our costs, limited the availability of metals and may lead to further trade conflicts.In 2018, the U.S. announced tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum imported from countries where we typically source metals. These tariffs were met with retaliatory tariffs from certain countries and increased, broader tariffs were levied by the U.S. on targeted countries, including China. The tariffs impacted the cost of the importation of steel, which we utilize in our steel plate and steel pipe, a key material in our NobelClad and DynaEnergetics’ businesses. Though in many cases we have been able to source metals from domestic suppliers, some materials are only available from sources subject to tariffs.  The cost of domestic steel and aluminum has also increased, along with the price of delivery, and the availability of certain materials has been limited. These increased costs have increased the price of our products to our customers and, in some instances, our ability to be competitive. For our NobelClad business, this impacts our ability to compete on international projects and negatively impacts U.S. fabricators, which are strong consumers of NobelClad products. Additionally, there is a risk that the U.S. tariffs on imports and retaliatory tariffs on U.S.-produced exports will trigger a broader global trade conflict. The risk of a broader global trade conflict or the prolonged duration of tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.16Table of ContentsIf our customers delay paying or fail to pay a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. We depend on a limited number of significant customers, and the loss of one or more significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated results of operations.In most cases, we bill our customers for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to the risk that our customers will delay payment of or fail to pay our invoices. In weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers’ cash flow from operations and their access to the credit markets and rising interest rates. If our customers delay paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.Failure to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our current operations.Our continued success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical employees. The loss of services of certain of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such individuals on acceptable terms, if at all, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We are subject to extensive government regulation and failure to comply could subject us to future liabilities and could adversely affect our ability to conduct or to expand our business.We are subject to extensive government regulation in the United States, Germany, Canada and Russia, including guidelines and regulations for the purchase, manufacture, handling, transport, storage and use of explosives issued by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety regulations set forth by the U.S. Department of Transportation; the Safety Library Publications of the Institute of Makers of Explosive; and similar guidelines of their European counterparts. In Germany, the transport, storage and use of explosives is governed by a permit issued under the Explosives Act (Sprengstoffgesetz). Our shooting sites located in Pennsylvania and in Dillenburg, Germany are located in mines, which subject us to certain regulations and oversight of governmental agencies that oversee mines.We are also subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulation, as described below under “Liabilities for natural resource damages, cleanup costs, and other damages under environmental, health and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.” and above under “The use of explosives subjects us to additional regulation, and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities.”In addition, the shipment of goods, services, and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Our import activities are governed by the unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate. Moreover, many countries, including the United States, control the export and re-export of certain goods, services and technology and impose related export recordkeeping and reporting obligations. Governments may also impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons, and entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities, which may limit or prevent our conduct of business in certain jurisdictions. The laws and regulations concerning import activity, export recordkeeping and reporting, export control, and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing. Changes in these laws and regulations or in related banking compliance programs and practices can cause delays in shipments or require us to cancel orders or restrict our ability to receive payments on certain orders. Moreover, any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory trading obligations could result in criminal and civil penalties and sanctions, such as fines, imprisonment, debarment from governmental contracts, seizure of shipments and loss of import and export privileges. Any failure to comply with current and future regulations in the countries where we operate could subject us to future liabilities. In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities, construct new facilities, or compete in certain markets or could require us to incur significant expenses in order to maintain compliance. Accordingly, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected by our non-compliance with applicable regulations, by any significant limitations on our business as a result of our inability to comply with applicable regulations, or by any requirement that we spend substantial amounts of capital to comply with such regulations.17Table of ContentsDemand for our products and services could be reduced by existing and future legislation or regulations.Environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the United States and other countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their potential role in climate change. Existing or future legislation and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, as well as government initiatives to conserve energy or promote the use of alternative energy sources, may significantly curtail demand for and production of fossil fuels such as oil and gas and, thus, adversely affect future demand for our products. This may, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Some international, national, state and local governments and agencies have also adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is a stimulation treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in low-permeability reservoirs. Specially engineered fluids are pumped at high pressure and rate into the reservoir interval to be treated, causing cracks in the target formation. Proppant, such as sand of a particular size, is mixed with the treatment fluid to keep the cracks open when the treatment is complete. Future hydraulic fracturing-related legislation or regulations could limit or ban hydraulic fracturing, or lead to operational delays and increased costs, and therefore reduce demand for our products. If such additional international, national, state or local legislation or regulations are enacted, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.In November 2018, voters in Colorado defeated a ""setback"" initiative, Proposition 112. Proposition 112 would have amended the Oil and Gas Conservation Act and prohibited the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission from permitting new oil and gas development closer than 2,500 feet from occupied structures or other areas such as playgrounds, parks, public open space and certain bodies of water. If Proposition 112 had passed, it would have significantly impacted the oil and gas industry in Colorado. Although Proposition 112 was defeated, similar legislation may be introduced in Colorado and other states to address public concerns about oil and gas development, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our operations are subject to political and economic instability and risk of government actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. We are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries in which we operate. Our operations are subject to various risks unique to each country that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. With respect to any particular country, these risks may include:•political and economic instability, including:    ◦civil unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war, other armed conflict, and sanctions;◦inflation; and◦currency fluctuations, devaluations, conversion, or repatriation restrictions; and•governmental actions that may:    ◦result in expropriation and nationalization of our assets in that country;◦result in confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies;◦limit extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing;◦limit or disrupt markets or our operations, restrict payments, or limit the movement of funds;◦result in increased tariffs;◦impose trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions;◦increase borrowing costs;◦result in the deprivation of contract rights; and◦result in the inability to obtain or retain licenses required for operation.Liabilities for natural resource damages, cleanup costs, and other damages under environmental, health and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. We are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulation in the United States and the other countries where our manufacturing facilities are located including those covering hazardous materials. We and all of our activities in the United States are subject noise abatement and air emissions regulations, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, regulations issued and laws enforced by the labor and employment departments of the U.S. and the states in which we conduct business, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In Germany, we and all our activities are subject to various safety and environmental regulations of the federal state which are enforced by the local authorities, including the Federal Act on Emission Control (Bundes-18Table of ContentsImmissionsschutzgesetz). The Federal Act on Emission Control permits are held by companies jointly owned by DynaEnergetics and the other companies that are located at the Troisdorf manufacturing site and are for an indefinite period of time. The Dillenburg, Germany facility is operated based on a specific permit granted by the local mountain authority and must be renewed every three years. Any failure to comply with current and future environmental and safety regulations could subject us to significant liabilities. Any actual or alleged violations of environmental, health or safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities or substantial civil or criminal sanctions. In addition, under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our facilities and at third party waste disposal sites, even when such contamination was caused by a predecessor and even when the actions resulting in the contamination were lawful at the time. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage. Accordingly, environmental, health or safety matters may result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.Our failure to comply with Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other laws could have a negative impact on our ongoing operations.We are subject to complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, and various other anti-bribery and anticorruption laws. The internal controls, policies and procedures, and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations. Any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Violations of international and U.S. laws and regulations may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, and restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business, operating results and financial condition.Changes in or interpretation of tax law and currency/repatriation control could impact the determination of our income tax liabilities for a tax year. We have worldwide operations. Consequently, we are subject to the jurisdiction of a significant number of taxing authorities. The income earned in these various jurisdictions is taxed on differing bases, including net income actually earned, net income deemed earned, and revenue-based tax withholding. The final determination of our income tax liabilities involves the interpretation of local tax laws, tax treaties, and related authorities in each jurisdiction, as well as the use of estimates and assumptions regarding the scope of future operations and results achieved and the timing and nature of income earned and expenditures incurred. Changes in the operating environment, including changes in or interpretation of tax law and currency/repatriation controls, could impact the determination of our income tax liabilities for a tax year in a manner that is adverse to us.The enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities, the adoption of other corporate tax reform policies, or changes in tax legislation or policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. Corporate tax reform, base-erosion prevention efforts and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many tax jurisdictions where we have business operations. As a result, policies regarding corporate income and other taxes in numerous jurisdictions are under heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation is being proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions. For example, the 2017 Tax Reform Act, among other things, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate and imposed base-erosion prevention measures on non-U.S. earnings of U.S. entities as well as a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated non-U.S. earnings of U.S. entities. The 2017 Tax Reform Act will affect the tax position reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and our obligations for cash taxes of our U.S. entities and has had a corresponding impact on our consolidated financial results starting in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018.In addition, many countries are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including through changes to cross-border tax, transfer-pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. As a result of the heightened scrutiny of corporate taxation policies, prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities, and legislative investigation and inquiry, which could also result in changes to tax policies or prior tax rulings. Any such changes in policies or rulings may also result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change.19Table of ContentsDue to the large scale of our international business activities any substantial changes in international corporate tax policies, enforcement activities or legislative initiatives may materially and adversely affect our business, the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our financial condition and results of operations generally.Work stoppages and other labor relations matters may make it substantially more difficult or expensive for us to produce our products, which could result in decreased sales or increased costs, either of which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to the risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters, particularly in Germany and France, where some of our employees are unionized. The employees at our U.S. manufacturing facilities are not unionized. Any prolonged work stoppage or strike at any one of our principal facilities could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future.   We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to litigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings with other parties. Managing or defending such legal proceedings may result in substantial legal fees, expenses and costs and diversion of management resources. If decided adversely to DMC, these legal proceedings, or others that could be brought against us in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. For a more detailed discussion of pending litigation, see Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.   In the event of a dispute arising at our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels, or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. Our inability to enforce our rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Our failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position. We rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our products and services. We may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future, and these rights could be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our products and services may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Our failure to protect our proprietary information could materially and adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets, and this could have a similar effect on our competitive position.We may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights.Moreover, the tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. We have an active ""freedom to operate"" review process for our technology, but there is no assurance that future infringement claims will not be asserted. Infringement claims, such as those raised in the recent GEODynamics litigation, generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business even if we are ultimately successful. In the event of any adverse ruling in any intellectual property litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacturing, use and sale of infringing products, discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain a license from the third party claiming infringement with royalty payment obligations by us. We also have certain indemnification obligations to customers with respect to the infringement of third party intellectual property rights by our products, which may increase our costs. A failure in our information technology systems or those of third parties, including those caused by security breaches, cyber-attacks or data protection failures, could disrupt our business, damage our reputation and cause losses.We are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our operations. Our information technology systems are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology 20Table of Contentsdisruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, theft, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.We outsource certain technology and business process functions to third parties and may increasingly do so in the future. If we do not effectively develop, implement and monitor our outsourcing strategy, third party providers do not perform as anticipated or we experience technological or other problems with a transition, we may not realize productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and loss of business. Our outsourcing of certain technology and business processes functions to third parties may expose us to enhanced risks related to data security, which could result in monetary and reputational damages. In addition, our ability to receive services from third party providers may be impacted by cultural differences, political instability, and unanticipated regulatory requirements or policies. As a result, our ability to conduct our business may be adversely affected.The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. We are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state laws and non-U.S. laws and regulations governing the protection of personal and confidential information of our customers and employees. In particular, the European Union (“E.U.”) has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which contains numerous requirements that must be complied with when handling the personal data of E.U.-based data subjects. We are subject to the GDPR with respect to our E.U. operations and employees. The GDPR and similar laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and sometimes conflict. In particular, as the E.U. states reframe their national legislation to harmonize with the GDPR, we will need to monitor compliance with all relevant E.U. member states' laws and regulations, including where permitted derogations from the GDPR are introduced. In addition, the states of California and Colorado have recently enacted data privacy laws, and such laws may be enacted in other states or at the U.S. federal level.The GDPR, any resultant changes in E.U. member states' national laws and regulations, and existing or new U.S. state or federal data privacy laws and regulations may increase our compliance obligations and may necessitate the review and implementation of policies and processes relating to our collection and use of data. This increase in compliance obligations could also lead to an increase in compliance costs which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any person, including any of our employees or those with whom we share such information, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to our client or employee data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. For example, under the GDPR there are significant new punishments for noncompliance which could result in a penalty of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of a firm's global annual revenue. In addition, a data breach could result in negative publicity which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.To the extent that we seek to expand our business through acquisitions, we may experience issues in executing acquisitions or integrating acquired operations.   From time to time, we examine opportunities to make selective acquisitions in order to increase shareholder return by increasing our total available markets, expanding our existing operations and, potentially, generating synergies. The success of any acquisition depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:   •identifying suitable candidates for acquisition and negotiating acceptable terms; •obtaining approval from regulatory authorities and potentially DMC’s shareholders; •maintaining our financial and strategic focus and avoiding distraction of management during the process of integrating the acquired business; •implementing our standards, controls, procedures and policies at the acquired business and addressing any pre-existing liabilities or claims involving the acquired business; and •to the extent the acquired operations are in a country in which we have not operated historically, understanding the regulations and challenges of operating in that new jurisdiction.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to conclude any acquisitions successfully or that any acquisition will achieve the anticipated synergies or other positive results. Any material problems that we encounter in connection with such an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. 21Table of ContentsIf we fail to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results in a timely and reliable manner, which could harm our business and impact the value of our securities.We depend on our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements in order to run our business. If we fail to do so, our business could be negatively affected and our independent registered public accounting firm may be unable to attest to the fair presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be harmed. Even effective internal controls have inherent limitations including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or a deterioration in the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures.If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls, including any failure to implement new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their execution, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In the event that our current control practices deteriorate, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and investor confidence and the market price of our stock may be adversely affected.Risk Factors
 Related to Our Common StockThe price of our common stock may be volatile, which may make it difficult for you to resell the common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive.   The market price and volume of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations due to general stock market conditions and/or a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations, business prospects or liquidity. Among the factors that could affect the price of our common stock are: •changes in the oil and gas, industrial, or infrastructure markets; •operating and financial performance that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts or investors; •developments in our business or in our business sectors generally; •regulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations; •the operating and stock price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;•announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors;•our ability to integrate and operate the companies and the businesses that we acquire; and•changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, including volatility in foreign exchange rates, tariffs and stock, commodity, credit or asset valuations, and federal government actions or shutdowns.  The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has at times been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Holders of our common stock may not receive dividends.   Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Under Delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be impaired. Our ability to pay dividends will be subject to our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as our compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future indebtedness. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and our Board of Directors may modify the dividend policy or reduce, defer or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future"

Risk Factors
 Related to our NobelClad SegmentNobelClad’s business is dependent on sales to a limited number of customers in cyclical markets and our results are affected by the price of metals. 13Table of ContentsNobelClad revenues are affected both by the demand for NobelClad’s explosion-welded cladding services and the base price of metal used in explosion-welded cladding operations. The explosion-welded cladding market is dependent upon sales of products for use by customers in a limited number of heavy industries, including oil and gas, chemicals and petrochemicals, alternative energy, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, rail car manufacturing, power generation, and industrial refrigeration. These industries tend to be cyclical in nature and an economic slowdown in one or all of these industries-whether due to traditional cyclicality, general economic conditions or other factors-could impact capital expenditures within that industry. In addition, metals prices affect the demand for cladded products and our margins. Higher metal prices increase demand by making it more economical for customers to use cladding on less-expensive metal than using solid metal plates. Higher metal prices also lead to higher sales (in terms of dollars rather than square meters of cladding) and generally higher margins for NobelClad. We have experienced a significant decline in the demand for clad products in recent years due in part to a low-metals price environment. If demand or metals prices do not increase or decline further, our sales would be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our backlog figures may not accurately predict future sales.We use backlog to predict our anticipated future sales. Our year-end backlog was $37.5 million, $31.6 million, and $41.8 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We define “backlog” at any given point in time to consist of all firm, unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time. We expect to fill most items of backlog within the following 12 months. However, since orders may be rescheduled or canceled and a significant portion of our net sales is derived from a small number of customers, backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels. Moreover, we cannot be sure of when during the future 12-month period we will be able to recognize revenue corresponding to our backlog nor can we be certain that revenues corresponding to our backlog will not fall into periods beyond the 12-month horizon. There is a limited availability of sites suitable for cladding operations.Our cladding process involves the detonation of large amounts of explosives. As a result, the sites where we perform cladding must meet certain criteria, including adequate distance from densely populated areas, specific geological characteristics, and the ability to comply with local noise and vibration abatement regulations in conducting the process. Our shooting sites located in Pennsylvania and in Dillenburg, Germany are located in mines. We plan to discontinue our Tautavel shooting site late in 2018, and move all shooting operations in Europe to Dillenburg. This will increase the demands on the Dillenburg mine. If a mine were seriously damaged, we might not be able to locate a suitable replacement site in a timely manner to continue our operations. In addition, our primary U.S. shooting site is subleased under an arrangement pursuant to which we provide certain contractual services to the sub-landlord. The efforts to identify suitable sites and obtain permits for using the sites from local government agencies can be time-consuming and may not be successful. In addition, we could experience difficulty in obtaining or renewing permits because of resistance from residents in the vicinity of proposed sites. The failure to obtain required governmental approvals or permits could limit our ability to expand our cladding business in the future, and the failure to maintain such permits or satisfy other conditions to use the sites would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.There is no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully against other manufacturers of competitive products.Our explosion-welded clad products compete with explosion-welded clad products made by other manufacturers in the clad metal business located throughout the world and with clad products manufactured using other technologies. Our combined North American and European operations typically supply explosion-welded clad to the worldwide market. There is one other well-known explosion-welded clad supplier worldwide - a division of Asahi-Kasei Corporation of Japan. There are also a number of smaller companies worldwide with explosion-welded clad manufacturing capability, including several companies in China that appear to be growing significantly in their domestic markets. Explosion-welded clad products also compete with those manufactured by rollbond and weld overlay cladding processes. The technical and commercial niches of each cladding process are well understood within the industry and vary from one world market location to another. We focus on reliability, product quality, on-time delivery performance, and low-cost manufacturing to minimize the potential of future competitive threats. However, there is no guarantee we will be able to maintain our competitive position.The use of explosives subjects us to additional regulation, and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities.Our operations involve the detonation of large amounts of explosives. The use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity. As a result, we are required to use specific safety precautions under U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration guidelines and guidelines of similar entities in Germany and France. These include precautions which must be tak14Table of Contentsen to protect employees from exposure to sound and ground vibration or falling debris associated with the detonation of explosives. There is a risk that an accident or death could occur in one of our facilities.  Explosions, even if occurring as intended, can lead to damage to the shooting site or manufacturing facility or to equipment used at the facility or injury or death to persons at the facility. Any accident could result in significant manufacturing delays, disruption of operations or claims for damages resulting from death or injuries, which could result in decreased sales and increased expenses. To date, we have not incurred any significant delays, disruptions or claims resulting from accidents at our facilities.  If an accident occurred, we might be required to suspend our operations for a period of time while an investigation is undertaken or repairs are made. Such a delay might impact our ability to meet the demand for our products.Customers have the right to change orders until products are completed.Customers have the right to change orders after they have been placed. If orders are changed, the extra expenses associated with the change will be passed on to the customer. However, because a change in an order may delay completion of the project, recognition of income for the project may also be delayed.Risk Factors
 Related to DynaEnergeticsDemand for DynaEnergetics’ products is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry. Decreased oil and gas prices and reduced expenditures in the oil and gas industry could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Demand for the majority of our products depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry’s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. From 2014 through mid-2017, oil and gas prices declined significantly, resulting in lower expenditures by the oil and gas industry during this period. As a result, many of our customers reduced or delayed their oil and gas exploration and production spending, reducing the demand for our products and exerting downward pressure on the prices that we charged and the revenues and profits we earned during this period. This resulted in DynaEnergetics’ revenues in 2016 being 36.2% less than in 2014 and in 2015 being 27.0% less than in 2014. Although we have seen increased oil and gas prices and increased exploration and production spending in 2017, resulting in increased revenues for DynaEnergetics, there is no assurance that such conditions will continue.There can be no assurance that the demand or pricing for oil and natural gas will continue at current levels or follow historic patterns. A decline in oil and gas prices could cause reductions in cash flows for our customers, which could have significant adverse effects on the financial condition of our customers. This could result in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us. These effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and can be affected by a variety of factors, including:  • demand for hydrocarbons, which is affected by general economic and business conditions;• the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels for oil;• oil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries;• the level of excess production capacity;• political and economic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest;• the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and production activity;• access to potential resources;• governmental policies and subsidies;• the costs of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;• technological advances affecting energy consumption; and• weather conditions.Constraints in the supply of, prices for, and availability of transportation of raw materials can have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations. Raw materials essential to our business, such as explosives, steel, metal powder, and electronics are normally readily available. Shortages of raw materials or long-lead times in receiving such materials as a result of high levels of demand or loss 15Table of Contentsof suppliers during market challenges can trigger constraints in the supply chain of those raw materials, particularly where we have a relationship with a single supplier for a particular resource. An increase in military activity in certain parts of the world could impact the availability of explosives as capacity could potentially be diverted to supply military requirements. These delays and constraints could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations. In addition, price increases imposed by our vendors for raw materials used in our business and the inability to pass these increases through to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations.Failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customers demand could adversely affect our results of operations.We make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing, internal fabrication utilization and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customer requirements. Factors that can impact our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements include the short-term nature of many customers’ commitments, our customers’ ability to reschedule, cancel and modify orders with little or no notice and without significant penalty, the accuracy of our customers’ forecasts, and seasonal or cyclical trends in customers' industries. To ensure availability of our products, particularly for our largest customers, we typically start manufacturing our relevant products based on our customers’ forecasts, which are not binding. As a result, we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales that may never materialize or which may be substantially lower than expected. If actual demand for our products is lower than forecast, we may also experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and product obsolescence. Because certain of our sales, research and development, and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income. Conversely, customers often require rapid increases in production on short notice. We may be unable to secure sufficient materials or contract manufacturing capacity to meet such increases in demand. This could damage our customer relationships, reduce revenue growth and margins, subject us to additional liabilities, harm our reputation, and prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities.Failure to manage periods of growth or contraction may seriously harm our business.Our industry frequently sees periods of expansion and contraction to adjust to customers’ needs and market demands. We regularly contend with these issues and must carefully manage our business to meet customer and market requirements. If we fail to manage these growth and contraction decisions effectively, we may find ourselves with either excess or insufficient resources and our business and our profitability could suffer as a result.Expansions, including the transfer of operations to other facilities or the construction of new manufacturing facilities, such as the planned new manufacturing and assembly facility and the addition of a second automated DynaSelect detonator line in Blum, Texas (together, the ""Blum expansion""), include the risk of additional costs and start-up inefficiencies. If we are unable to effectively manage our expansions or related anticipated net sales are not realized, our operating results could be adversely affected. Risks of the Blum expansion project and future expansions include:    •increased costs associated with opening new facilities, including the ability to meet budget constraints on construction projects;•difficulties in the timing of expansions, including delays in the implementation of construction and manufacturing plans;•the inability to successfully integrate additional facilities or incremental capacity and to realize anticipated efficiencies, economies of scale or other value;•challenges faced as a result of transitioning programs;•additional fixed or other costs, or selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses, which may not be fully absorbed by the new business;•a reduction of our return on invested capital, including as a result of excess inventory or excess capacity at new facilities;•diversion of management’s attention from other business areas during the planning and implementation of expansions;•strain placed on our operational, financial and other systems and resources, and•inability to locate sufficient employees or management talent to support the expansion.Periods of contraction or reduced net sales, or other factors affecting particular sites, create other challenges. We must determine whether facilities remain viable, whether staffing levels need to be reduced, and how to respond to changing levels 16Table of Contentsof customer demand. While maintaining excess capacity or higher levels of employment entails short-term costs, reductions in capacity or employment could impair our ability to respond to new opportunities and programs, market improvements or to maintain customer relationships. Our decisions to reduce costs and capacity can affect our short-term and long-term results and result in restructuring charges. Demand for our products and services could be reduced by existing and future legislation or regulations.Environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the United States and other countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their potential role in climate change. Existing or future legislation and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, as well as government initiatives to conserve energy or promote the use of alternative energy sources, may significantly curtail demand for and production of fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and thus adversely affect future demand for our products. This may, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Some international, national, state and local governments and agencies have also adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is a stimulation treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in low-permeability reservoirs. Specially engineered fluids are pumped at high pressure and rate into the reservoir interval to be treated, causing cracks in the target formation. Proppant, such as sand of a particular size, is mixed with the treatment fluid to keep the cracks open when the treatment is complete. Future hydraulic fracturing-related legislation or regulations could limit or ban hydraulic fracturing, or lead to operational delays and increased costs, and therefore reduce demand for our products. If such additional international, national, state or local legislation or regulations are enacted, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.If we are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, and technology trends, our business and consolidated results of operations and the value of our intellectual property could be materially and adversely affected. The market for our products is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better and more reliable performance. If we are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, and technology trends, our business and consolidated results of operations and the value of our intellectual property could be materially and adversely affected. Likewise, if our proprietary technologies, equipment, facilities, or work processes become obsolete, we may no longer be competitive, and our business and consolidated results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.The manufacturing of explosives subjects DynaEnergetics to various environmental, health and safety laws and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities.The use of explosives is inherently dangerous. DynaEnergetics is subject to a number of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations covering all aspects of the business including general operating licenses, transportation domestically and internationally, storage requirements, waste disposal, manufacturing regulations, employee training and certification requirements, and labor regulations. Violation of these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties or in interruption of our business activities. DynaEnergetics’ success depends on continued compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, new environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could be passed that could create costly compliance issues. While DynaEnergetics endeavors to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, compliance with future laws and regulations may not be economically feasible or even possible. Even with compliance with applicable health and safety laws, it is possible that accidents may occur, potentially resulting in injury to our employees, equipment and facilities. Any accident could result in significant manufacturing delays, disruption of operations or claims for damages resulting from death or injuries, which could result in decreased sales and increased expenses.We may not be able to continue to compete successfully against other perforating companies.DynaEnergetics competes principally with perforating companies based in North America, South America, and Russia, which produce and market perforating services and products. DynaEnergetics also competes with oil and gas service companies that are able to satisfy a portion of their perforating needs through in-house production. To remain competitive, DynaEnergetics must continue to provide innovative products and maintain an excellent reputation for safety, quality, on-time delivery, and value. There can be no assurances that we will continue to compete successfully against these companies.17Table of ContentsRisk Factors
 Related to our Businesses GenerallyOur operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter.We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in annual and quarterly operating results caused by various factors at both NobelClad and DynaEnergetics. At NobelClad, quarterly sales and operating results depend on the volume and timing of the orders in our backlog as well as bookings during the quarter. At DynaEnergetics, the level of demand from our customers is impacted by oil and gas prices as well as a variety of other factors and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Significant portions of our operating expenses are fixed, and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts and product development programs. If sales do not meet our expectations in any given period, the adverse impact on operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust operating expenses sufficiently or quickly enough to compensate for such a shortfall. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results for any future period. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock.  We are exposed to potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against the currencies of many of our operating subsidiaries. Many of our operating subsidiaries conduct business in Euros or other foreign currencies such as the Russian Ruble. Sales made in currencies other than U.S. dollars accounted for 28%, 28%, and 23% of total sales for the years ended 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of any of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience foreign currency translation (gains) losses with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. In addition, our company and our operating subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we or they enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or their respective functional currencies. For example, DynaEnergetics KG’s functional currency is Euros, but its sales often occur in U.S. dollars. Changes in exchange rates with respect to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. In addition, we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to our operating subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities and to the financial results of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of equity. Our primary exposure to foreign currency risk is the Euro due to the percentage of our U.S. dollar revenue that is derived from countries where the Euro is the functional currency and the Russian Ruble due to our operations in Tyumen, Siberia. During the third quarter of 2017, we began using foreign currency forward contracts, generally with maturities of one month, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated asset and liability account balances. These hedge transactions relate to our operating entities with significant economic exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. Our primary economic exposures include the U.S. dollar to the Euro, the U.S. dollar to the Canadian dollar, the Euro to the U.S. Dollar and the Euro to the Russian Ruble. Since the underlying balance sheet account balances being hedged can fluctuate significantly throughout our monthly hedge periods, our hedging program cannot fully protected against foreign currency fluctuations.The terms of our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants, the breach of any of which could result in acceleration of payment of our credit facilities.As of December 31, 2017, we had an outstanding balance of approximately $18.3 million on our syndicated credit agreement. This agreement includes various covenants and restrictions and certain of these relate to the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the mortgaging, pledging or disposing of major assets. We are also required to maintain certain financial ratios on a quarterly basis. A breach of any of these covenants could impair our ability to borrow and could result in acceleration of our obligations to repay our debt, if we are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment from our lenders. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and other provisions of the credit agreement and our other loan agreements. Any failure to remain in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our credit agreement could result in a default, which would, absent a waiver or amendment, require immediate repayment of outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities.We are dependent on a relatively small number of large projects and customers for a significant portion of our net sales.A significant portion of our net sales is derived from a relatively small number of projects and customers; therefore, the failure to complete existing contracts on a timely basis, to receive payment for such services in a timely manner, or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect our ability to meet cash requirements exclusively through operating activities. We attempt to minimize the risk of losing customers or specific contracts by 18Table of Contentscontinually improving commercial execution, product quality, delivering product on time and competing aggressively on the basis of price. We expect to continue to depend upon our principal customers for a significant portion of our sales, although our principal customers may not continue to purchase products and services from us at current levels, if at all. The loss of one or more major customers or a change in their buying patterns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We are susceptible to the cyclicality of the steel industry. Steel plate and steel pipe are key materials used our NobelClad and DynaEnergetics’ businesses. The steel industry is very cyclical and is affected significantly by supply and demand factors, general economic conditions and other factors such as worldwide production capacity, fluctuations in steel imports/exports, tariffs and quotas. Additional tariffs, such as those recently announced as planned on steel and aluminum, will increase our raw materials costs and ultimately increase the cost of our products to our customers. For our NobelClad business, this would impact our ability to compete on international projects and will negatively impact U.S. fabricators, which are strong consumers of NobelClad products. The downturn in the U.S. economy in fiscal 2010 had an adverse effect on the U.S. steel industry and on our NobelClad business. The prolonged duration of these conditions and any future downturns in the industry, or the imposition of additional tariffs and quotas, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our customers delay paying or fail to pay a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. We depend on a limited number of significant customers. For the year ended December 31, 2017, one customer represented approximately 10% of consolidated revenue, and the loss of one or more significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated results of operations.In most cases, we bill our customers for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our customers delaying or failing to pay our invoices. In weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers’ cash flow from operations and their access to the credit markets. If our customers delay paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.Failure to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our current operations.Our continued success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical employees. The loss of services of certain of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such individuals on acceptable terms, if at all; and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We are subject to extensive government regulation and failure to comply could subject us to future liabilities and could adversely affect our ability to conduct or to expand our business.We are subject to extensive government regulation in the United States, Germany, France, Canada and Russia, including guidelines and regulations for the purchase, manufacture, handling, transport, storage and use of explosives issued by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety regulations set forth by the U.S. Department of Transportation; the Safety Library Publications of the Institute of Makers of Explosive; and similar guidelines of their European counterparts. In Germany, the transport, storage and use of explosives is governed by a permit issued under the Explosives Act (Sprengstoffgesetz). In France, the manufacture and transportation of explosives is subcontracted to a third party, who is responsible for compliance with regulations established by various state and local governmental agencies concerning the handling and transportation of explosives. Our French operations could be adversely affected if the third party does not comply with these regulations. We must comply with licensing requirements and regulations for the purchase, transport, storage, manufacture, handling and use of explosives. In addition, while our shooting sites in Tautavel, France are located outdoors, our shooting sites located in Pennsylvania and in Dillenburg, Germany are located in mines, which subject us to certain regulations and oversight of governmental agencies that oversee mines.We are also subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulation, as described below under “Liabilities under environmental, health and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability” and above under “The use of explosives subjects us to additional regulation, and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities.”19Table of ContentsIn addition, the shipment of goods, services, and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Our import activities are governed by the unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate. Moreover, many countries, including the United States, control the export and re-export of certain goods, services and technology and impose related export recordkeeping and reporting obligations. Governments may also impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons, and entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities, which may limit or prevent our conduct of business in certain jurisdictions. The laws and regulations concerning import activity, export recordkeeping and reporting, export control, and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing. These laws and regulations can cause delays in shipments and unscheduled operational downtime. Moreover, any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory trading obligations could result in criminal and civil penalties and sanctions, such as fines, imprisonment, debarment from governmental contracts, seizure of shipments and loss of import and export privileges. Any failure to comply with current and future regulations in the countries where we operate could subject us to future liabilities. In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities, construct new facilities, or compete in certain markets or could require us to incur significant expenses in order to maintain compliance. Accordingly, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected by our non-compliance with applicable regulations, by any significant limitations on our business as a result of our inability to comply with applicable regulations, or by any requirement that we spend substantial amounts of capital to comply with such regulations.Our operations are subject to political and economic instability and risk of government actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. We are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries in which we operate. Our operations are subject to various risks unique to each country that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. With respect to any particular country, these risks may include:•political and economic instability, including:    ◦civil unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war, other armed conflict, and sanctions;◦inflation; and◦currency fluctuations, devaluations, and conversion restrictions; and•governmental actions that may:    ◦result in expropriation and nationalization of our assets in that country;◦result in confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies;◦limit or disrupt markets or our operations, restrict payments, or limit the movement of funds;◦result in the deprivation of contract rights; and◦result in the inability to obtain or retain licenses required for operation.Liabilities under environmental, health and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability.We are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulation in the countries where our manufacturing facilities are located. Any failure to comply with current and future environmental and safety regulations could subject us to significant liabilities. In particular, any failure to control the discharge of hazardous materials and wastes could subject us to significant liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.We and all our activities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations, including but not limited to, noise abatement and air emissions regulations, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, regulations issued and laws enforced by the labor and employment departments of the U.S. and the states in which we conduct business, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In Germany, we and all our activities are subject to various safety and environmental regulations of the federal state which are enforced by the local authorities, including the Federal Act on Emission Control (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz). The Federal Act on Emission Control permits are held by companies jointly owned by DynaEnergetics and the other companies that are located at the Troisdorf manufacturing site and are for an indefinite period of time. In France, we and all our activities are subject to state environmental and safety regulations established by various departments of the French Government, including the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Ecology and the Ministry of Industry, and to local environmental and safety regulations and administrative procedures established by DRIRE (Direction Régionale de l’Industrie, de la Recherche et de l’Environnement) and the Préfecture des Pyrénées Orientales. In addition, our shooting operations in France may be particularly vulnerable to noise abatement regulations because these operations are primarily co20Table of Contentsnducted outdoors. The Dillenburg, Germany facility is operated based on a specific permit granted by the local mountain authority and must be renewed every three years.Changes in or compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require modifications to our facilities. Any actual or alleged violations of environmental, health or safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities or substantial civil or criminal sanctions. Some laws and regulations impose strict liability and/or joint and several liability. In addition, under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our facilities and at third party waste disposal sites, even when such contamination was caused by a predecessor and even when the actions resulting in the contamination were lawful at the time. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage. Accordingly, environmental, health or safety matters may result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities.Our failure to comply with Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other laws could have a negative impact on our ongoing operations.We are subject to complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, and various other anti-bribery and anticorruption laws. The internal controls, policies and procedures, and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations. Any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Violations of international and U.S. laws and regulations may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, and restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business, operating results and financial condition.Changes in or interpretation of tax law and currency/repatriation control could impact the determination of our income tax liabilities for a tax year. We have worldwide operations. Consequently, we are subject to the jurisdiction of a significant number of taxing authorities. The income earned in these various jurisdictions is taxed on differing bases, including net income actually earned, net income deemed earned, and revenue-based tax withholding. The final determination of our income tax liabilities involves the interpretation of local tax laws, tax treaties, and related authorities in each jurisdiction, as well as the use of estimates and assumptions regarding the scope of future operations and results achieved and the timing and nature of income earned and expenditures incurred. Changes in the operating environment, including changes in or interpretation of tax law and currency/repatriation controls, could impact the determination of our income tax liabilities for a tax year.The enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities, the adoption of other corporate tax reform policies, or changes in tax legislation or policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. Corporate tax reform, base-erosion efforts and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many tax jurisdictions where we have business operations. As a result, policies regarding corporate income and other taxes in numerous jurisdictions are under heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation is being proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions. For example, the 2017 Tax Reform Act, among other things, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate, and imposed base-erosion prevention measures on non-U.S. earnings of U.S. entities as well as a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated non-U.S. earnings of U.S. entities. The 2017 Tax Reform Act will affect the tax position reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and our obligations for cash taxes of our U.S. entities and will have a corresponding impact on our consolidated financial results starting in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018.In addition, many countries are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer-pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. As a result of the heightened scrutiny of corporate taxation policies, prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities, and legislative investigation and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings. Any such changes in policies or rulings may also result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change.21Table of ContentsDue to the large scale of our international business activities any substantial changes in international corporate tax policies, enforcement activities or legislative initiatives may materially and adversely affect our business, the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our financial condition and results of operations generally.Work stoppages and other labor relations matters may make it substantially more difficult or expensive for us to produce our products, which could result in decreased sales or increased costs, either of which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to the risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters, particularly in Germany and France, where some of our employees are unionized. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we experienced a total of 11 days work stoppage at our facility in Rivesaltes, France related to the consolidation program of NobelClad's European explosion welding operations. We could experience additional strikes or work stoppages in the future as a result of our planned closure of manufacturing operations in Rivesaltes, France during 2018. The employees at our U.S. manufacturing facilities are not unionized. Any prolonged work stoppage or strike at any one of our principal facilities could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future.   We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to litigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings with other parties. Managing or defending such legal proceedings may result in substantial legal fees, expenses and costs and diversion of management resources. If decided adversely to DMC, these legal proceedings, or others that could be brought against us in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. For a more detailed discussion of pending litigation, see Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.   In the event of a dispute arising at our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels, or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. Our inability to enforce our rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Our failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position. We rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our products and services. We may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future, and these rights could be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our products and services may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Our failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position. Our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights.The tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. We have an active freedom to operate review process for our technology, but there is no assurance that future infringement claims will not be asserted. Infringement claims, such as those raised in the ongoing GEODynamics litigation, generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business even if we are ultimately successful. In the event of any adverse ruling in any intellectual property litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacturing, use and sale of infringing products, discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain a license from the third party claiming infringement with royalty payment obligations by us. We also have certain indemnification obligations to customers with respect to the infringement of third party intellectual property rights by our products, which may increase our costs. A failure in our information technology systems or those of third parties, including those caused by security breaches, cyber-attacks or data protection failures, could disrupt our business, damage our reputation and causes losses.We are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our operations. Our information technology systems are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, are evolving and 22Table of Contentsinclude, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.We outsource certain technology and business process functions to third parties and may increasingly do so in the future. If we do not effectively develop, implement and monitor our outsourcing strategy, third party providers do not perform as anticipated or we experience technological or other problems with a transition, we may not realize productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and loss of business. Our outsourcing of certain technology and business processes functions to third parties may expose us to enhanced risks related to data security, which could result in monetary and reputational damages. In addition, our ability to receive services from third party providers may be impacted by cultural differences, political instability, unanticipated regulatory requirements or policies. As a result, our ability to conduct our business may be adversely affected.The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. We are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state laws and non-U.S. laws and regulations governing the protection of personal and confidential information of our customers and employees. In particular, the European Union (“E.U.”) has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which is scheduled to go into effect in May 2018 and contains numerous requirements that must be complied with when handling the personal data of E.U. based data subjects. We will be subject to the GDPR with respect to our E.U. operations and employees. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and sometimes conflict. In particular, as the E.U. states reframe their national legislation to prepare for and harmonize with the GDPR, we will need to monitor compliance with all relevant E.U. member states' laws and regulations, including where permitted derogations from the GDPR are introduced.The introduction of the GDPR, and any resultant changes in E.U. member states' national laws and regulations, may increase our compliance obligations and may necessitate the review and implementation of policies and processes relating to our collection and use of data. This increase in compliance obligations could also lead to an increase in compliance costs which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any person, including any of our employees or those with whom we share such information, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to our client or employee data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. For example, under the GDPR there are significant new punishments for noncompliance which could result in a penalty of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of a firm's global annual revenue. In addition, a data breach could result in negative publicity which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.To the extent that we seek to expand our business through acquisitions, we may experience issues in executing acquisitions or integrating acquired operations.   From time to time, we examine opportunities to make selective acquisitions in order to increase shareholder return by increasing our total available markets, expanding our existing operations and, potentially, generating synergies. The success of any acquisition depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:   •identifying suitable candidates for acquisition and negotiating acceptable terms; •obtaining approval from regulatory authorities and potentially DMC’s shareholders; •maintaining our financial and strategic focus and avoiding distraction of management during the process of integrating the acquired business; •implementing our standards, controls, procedures and policies at the acquired business and addressing any pre-existing liabilities or claims involving the acquired business; and •to the extent the acquired operations are in a country in which we have not operated historically, understanding the regulations and challenges of operating in that new jurisdiction.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to conclude any acquisitions successfully or that any acquisition will achieve the anticipated synergies or other positive results. Any material problems that we encounter in connection with such an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. 23Table of ContentsIf we fail to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results in a timely and reliable manner, which could harm our business and impact the value of our securities.We depend on our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements in order to run our business. If we fail to do so, our business could be negatively affected and our independent registered public accounting firm may be unable to attest to the fair presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be harmed. Even effective internal controls have inherent limitations including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or a deterioration in the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures.If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls, including any failure to implement new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their execution, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In the event that our current control practices deteriorate, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and investor confidence and the market price of our stock may be adversely affected.Risk Factors
 Related to Our Common StockThe price of our common stock may be volatile, which may make it difficult for you to resell the common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive.   The market price and volume of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations due to general stock market conditions and/or a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations, business prospects or liquidity. Among the factors that could affect the price of our common stock are: •changes in the oil and gas, industrial, or infrastructure markets; •operating and financial performance that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors; •developments in our business or in our business sectors generally; •regulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations; •the operating and stock price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;•announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors;•our ability to integrate and operate the companies and the businesses that we acquire; and•changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity, credit or asset valuations or volatility.  The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has at times been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Holders of our common stock may not receive dividends.   Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Under Delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be impaired. Our ability to pay dividends will be subject to our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as our compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future indebtedness. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and our Board of Directors may modify the dividend policy or reduce, defer or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future.  24Table of Contents"

Risk Factors
 Related to our NobelClad SegmentNobelClad’s business is dependent on sales to a limited number of customers in cyclical markets and our results are affected by the price of metals. NobelClad revenues are affected both by the demand for NobelClad’s explosion-welded cladding services and the base price of metal used in explosion-welded cladding operations.  The explosion-welded cladding market is dependent upon sales of products for use by customers in a limited number of heavy industries, including oil and gas, chemicals and petrochemicals, 12Table of Contentsalternative energy, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation, and industrial refrigeration.  These industries tend to be cyclical in nature and an economic slowdown in one or all of these industries-whether due to traditional cyclicality, general economic conditions or other factors-could impact capital expenditures within that industry.   In addition, metals prices affect the demand for cladded products and our margins.  Higher metal prices increase demand by making it more economical for customers to use cladding on less-expensive metal than using solid metal plates.  Higher metal prices also lead to higher sales (in terms of dollars rather than square meters of cladding) and generally higher margins for NobelClad. We have experienced a significant decline in the demand for clad products in recent years in a low-metals price environment, with sales of $91.3 million in 2016, compared to sales of $195.0 million in 2008.  If demand or metals prices fail to improve or decline further, our sales would be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  Our backlog figures may not accurately predict future sales.We use backlog to predict our anticipated future sales.  Our year-end backlog was $31.6 million, $41.8 million, and $41.2 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  We define “backlog” at any given point in time to consist of all firm, unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time.  We expect to fill most items of backlog within the following 12 months.  However, since orders may be rescheduled or canceled and a significant portion of our net sales is derived from a small number of customers, backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels.  Moreover, we cannot be sure of when during the future 12-month period we will be able to recognize revenue corresponding to our backlog nor can we be certain that revenues corresponding to our backlog will not fall into periods beyond the 12-month horizon.  There is a limited availability of sites suitable for cladding operations.Our cladding process involves the detonation of large amounts of explosives. As a result, the sites where we perform cladding must meet certain criteria, including adequate distance from densely populated areas, the specific geological characteristics of the site, and the ability to comply with local noise and vibration abatement regulations in conducting the process. In addition, our primary U.S. shooting site is subleased under an arrangement pursuant to which we provide certain contractual services to the sub-landlord.  The efforts to identify suitable sites and obtain permits for using the sites from local government agencies can be time-consuming and may not be successful.  In addition, we could experience difficulty in obtaining or renewing permits because of resistance from residents in the vicinity of proposed sites.  The failure to obtain required governmental approvals or permits could limit our ability to expand our cladding business in the future, and the failure to maintain such permits or satisfy other conditions to use the sites would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.There is no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully against other manufacturers of competitive products.Our explosion-welded clad products compete with explosion-welded clad products made by other manufacturers in the clad metal business located throughout the world and with clad products manufactured using other technologies. Our combined North American and European operations typically supply explosion-welded clad to the worldwide market. There is one other well-known explosion-welded clad supplier worldwide- a division of Asahi-Kasei Corporation of Japan. There are also a number of smaller companies worldwide with explosion-welded clad manufacturing capability, including several companies in China and in South Korea that appear to be growing significantly in their domestic markets.  Explosion-welded clad products also compete with those manufactured by rollbond and weld overlay cladding processes. In rollbond technology, the clad and base metal are bonded together during a hot rolling process in which slab is converted to plate. In weld overlay, which is typically performed by our fabricator customers, the cladding layer is deposited on the base metal through a fusion welding process. The technical and commercial niches of each cladding process are well understood within the industry and vary from one world market location to another.  We focus strongly on reliability, product quality, on-time delivery performance, and low cost manufacturing to minimize the potential of future competitive threats.  However, there is no guarantee we will be able to maintain our competitive position.The use of explosives subjects us to additional regulation, and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities.Our operations involve the detonation of large amounts of explosives.  The use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity.  As a result, we are required to use specific safety precautions under U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration guidelines and guidelines of similar entities in Germany and France.  These include precautions which must be taken to protect employees from exposure to sound and ground vibration or falling debris associated with the detonation of explosives.  There is a risk that an accident or death could occur in one of our facilities.  13Table of ContentsExplosions, even if occurring as intended, can lead to damage to the shooting site or manufacturing facility or to equipment used at the facility or injury or death to persons at the facility. Any accident could result in significant manufacturing delays, disruption of operations or claims for damages resulting from death or injuries, which could result in decreased sales and increased expenses. To date, we have not incurred any significant delays, disruptions or claims resulting from accidents at our facilities.  If an accident occurred, we might be required to suspend our operations for a period of time while an investigation is undertaken or repairs are made.  Such a delay might impact our ability to meet the demand for our products.  In addition, our shooting facilities located in Pennsylvania and in Dillenburg, Germany are located in mines.  If a mine were seriously damaged, we might not be able to locate a suitable replacement site to continue our operations.Customers have the right to change orders until products are completed.Customers have the right to change orders after they have been placed.  If orders are changed, the extra expenses associated with the change will be passed on to the customer.  However, because a change in an order may delay completion of the project, recognition of income for the project may also be delayed.Risk Factors
 Related to DynaEnergeticsDemand for DynaEnergetics’ products is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry. Expenditures in the oil and gas industry and related demand for oilfield services remains well below 2014 levels, which has had, and may continue to have, a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Demand for the majority of our products depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry’s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. Since 2014, oil and gas prices have declined significantly, resulting in lower expenditures by the oil and gas industry. As a result, many of our customers have reduced or delayed their oil and gas exploration and production spending, reducing the demand for our products and exerting downward pressure on the prices that we charge. These conditions have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial condition.  DynaEnergetics’ revenues were 36.2% less in 2016 than in 2014 and 27.0% less in 2015 than in 2014.  A decline in oil and gas prices could cause a further reduction in cash flows for our customers, which could have significant adverse effects on the financial condition of some of our customers. This could result in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us. These effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There can be no assurance that the demand or pricing for oil and natural gas will follow historic patterns or recover in the near term. Worsening conditions in the oil and gas industry could further adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and can be affected by a variety of factors, including:  • demand for hydrocarbons, which is affected by general economic and business conditions;• the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels for oil;• oil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries;• the level of excess production capacity;• political and economic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest;• the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and production activity;• access to potential resources;• governmental policies and subsidies;• the costs of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;• technological advances affecting energy consumption; and• weather conditions.Constraints in the supply of, prices for, and availability of transportation of raw materials can have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations. 14Table of ContentsRaw materials essential to our business, such as explosives, steel, metal powder, and electronics are normally readily available. Shortage of raw materials or long-lead times in receiving such materials as a result of high levels of demand or loss of suppliers during market challenges can trigger constraints in the supply chain of those raw materials, particularly where we have a relationship with a single supplier for a particular resource.  An increase in military activity in certain parts of the world could impact the availability of explosives as capacity could potentially be diverted to supply military requirements.  These delays and constraints could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations. In addition, price increases imposed by our vendors for raw materials used in our business and the inability to pass these increases through to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations.The adoption of any future laws or regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting or banning, the hydraulic fracturing process could cause a decrease in natural gas and oil well perforating and could materially adversely affect DynaEnergetics’ sales and economic performance.DynaEnergetics' perforating products are used for oil and gas well hydraulic fracturing processes, among other uses. Various federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives have been undertaken, which could result in additional requirements or restrictions being imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations. The adoption of these or other laws or implementation of regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting or banning, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to use hydraulic fracturing for natural gas and oil well development, which would reduce the demand for some of DynaEnergetics' products and could have a material adverse effect on its sales and financial performance.If we are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, and technology trends, our business and consolidated results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, and the value of our intellectual property may be reduced. The market for our products is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better and more reliable performance. If we are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, and technology trends, our business and consolidated results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, and the value of our intellectual property may be reduced. Likewise, if our proprietary technologies, equipment, facilities, or work processes become obsolete, we may no longer be competitive, and our business and consolidated results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.The manufacturing of explosives subjects DynaEnergetics to various environmental, health and safety laws and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities.The use of explosive is inherently dangerous.  DynaEnergetics is subject to a number of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations covering all aspects of the business including general operating licenses, transportation domestically and internationally, storage requirements, waste disposal, manufacturing regulations, employee training and certification requirements, and labor regulations.  Violation of these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties or in interruption of our business activities.  DynaEnergetics’ continued success depends on continued compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  In addition, new environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could be passed that could create costly compliance issues.  While DynaEnergetics endeavors to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, compliance with future laws and regulations may not be economically feasible or even possible.  Even with compliance with applicable health and safety laws, it is possible that accidents may occur, potentially resulting in injury to our employees, equipment and facilities.  Any accident could result in significant manufacturing delays, disruption of operations or claims for damages resulting from death or injuries, which could result in decreased sales and increased expenses.We may not be able to continue to compete successfully against other perforating companies.DynaEnergetics competes principally with perforating companies based in North America, South America, and Russia, which produce and market perforating services and products.  DynaEnergetics also competes with oil and gas service companies that are able to satisfy a portion of their perforating needs through in-house production.  To remain competitive, DynaEnergetics must continue to provide innovative products and maintain an excellent reputation for quality, safety, and value.  There can be no assurances that we will continue to compete successfully against these companies.Risk Factors
 Related to our Businesses GenerallyOur operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter.15Table of ContentsWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in annual and quarterly operating results caused by various factors at both NobelClad and DynaEnergetics.  At NobelClad, quarterly sales and operating results depend on the volume and timing of the orders in our backlog as well as bookings during the quarter.  At DynaEnergetics, the level of demand from our customers is impacted by oil and gas prices as well as a variety of other factors and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter.  Significant portions of our operating expenses are fixed, and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts and product development programs. If sales do not meet our expectations in any given period, the adverse impact on operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust operating expenses sufficiently or quickly enough to compensate for such a shortfall. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results for any future period. Fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock.  See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”We are exposed to potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against the currencies of many of our operating subsidiaries.Many of our operating subsidiaries conduct business in Euros or other foreign currencies such as the Russian Ruble.  Sales made in currencies other than U.S. dollars accounted for 28%, 23%, and 32% of total sales for the years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of any of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience foreign currency translation (gains) losses with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. In addition, our company and our operating subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we or they enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or their respective functional currencies. For example, DynaEnergetics KG’s functional currency is Euros, but its sales often occur in U.S. dollars.  Changes in exchange rates with respect to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. In addition, we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to our operating subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities and to the financial results of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of equity.  As a result of foreign currency risk, we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our primary exposure to foreign currency risk is the Euro due to the percentage of our U.S. dollar revenue that is derived from countries where the Euro is the functional currency and the Russian Ruble due to our operations in Tyumen, Siberia. The terms of our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants, the breach of any of which could result in acceleration of payment of our credit facilities.As of December 31, 2016, we had an outstanding balance of approximately $16.3 million on our syndicated credit agreement. This agreement includes various covenants and restrictions and certain of these relate to the incurrence of additional indebtedness, mortgaging, pledging or disposing of major assets. We are also required to maintain certain financial ratios on a quarterly basis. A breach of any of these covenants could impair our ability to borrow and could result in acceleration of our obligations to repay our debt, if we are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment from our lenders. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and other provisions of the credit agreement and our other loan agreements.  On March 6, 2017, we entered into an amendment of our syndicated credit agreement which reduced the amount of U.S. borrowings available under the credit facility, increased the maximum debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio for the first, second, and third quarters of 2017, waived the applicability of the minimum debt service coverage ratio for first, second, and third quarters of 2017, and added a minimum EBITDA covenant for those same periods, which is inapplicable thereafter. Any failure to remain in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our credit agreement could result in a default, which would, absent a waiver or amendment, require immediate repayment of outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities.We are dependent on a relatively small number of large projects and customers for a significant portion of our net sales.A significant portion of our net sales is derived from a relatively small number of projects and customers; therefore, the failure to complete existing contracts on a timely basis, to receive payment for such services in a timely manner, or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect our ability to meet cash requirements exclusively through operating activities. We attempt to minimize the risk of losing customers or specific contracts by continually improving commercial execution, product quality, delivering product on time and competing aggressively on the basis of price.  We expect to continue to depend upon our principal customers for a significant portion of our sales, although 16Table of Contentsour principal customers may not continue to purchase products and services from us at current levels, if at all. The loss of one or more major customers or a change in their buying patterns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.If our customers delay paying or fail to pay a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. We depend on a limited number of significant customers. While none of these customers represented more than 10% of consolidated revenue in any period presented, the loss of one or more significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated results of operations.In most cases, we bill our customers for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our customers delaying or failing to pay our invoices. In weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers’ cash flow from operations and their access to the credit markets. If our customers delay paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.Failure to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our current operations.Our continued success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical employees. The loss of services of certain of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such individuals on acceptable terms, if at all; and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We are subject to extensive government regulation and failure to comply could subject us to future liabilities and could adversely affect our ability to conduct or to expand our business.We are subject to extensive government regulation in the United States, Germany, France, Canada and Russia, including guidelines and regulations for the purchase, manufacture, handling, transport, storage and use of explosives issued by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations set forth by the U.S. Department of Transportation; the Safety Library Publications of the Institute of Makers of Explosive; and similar guidelines of their European counterparts.  In Germany, the transport, storage and use of explosives is governed by a permit issued under the Explosives Act (Sprengstoffgesetz).  In France, the manufacture and transportation of explosives is subcontracted to a third party which is responsible for compliance with regulations established by various State and local governmental agencies concerning the handling and transportation of explosives.  Our French operations could be adversely affected if the third party does not comply with these regulations.  We must comply with licensing requirements and regulations for the purchase, transport, storage, manufacture, handling and use of explosives. In addition, while our shooting facilities in Tautavel, France are located outdoors, our shooting facilities located in Pennsylvania and in Dillenburg, Germany are located in mines, which subject us to certain regulations and oversight of governmental agencies that oversee mines.We are also subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulation, as described below under “Liabilities under environmental, health and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability” and above under “The use of explosives subjects us to additional regulation, and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities.”In addition, the shipment of goods, services, and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Our import activities are governed by the unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate. Moreover, many countries, including the United States, control the export and re-export of certain goods, services and technology and impose related export recordkeeping and reporting obligations. Governments may also impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons, and entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities, which may limit or prevent our conduct of business in certain jurisdictions. The laws and regulations concerning import activity, export recordkeeping and reporting, export control, and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing. These laws and regulations can cause delays in shipments and unscheduled operational downtime. Moreover, any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory trading obligations could result in criminal and civil penalties and sanctions, such as fines, imprisonment, debarment from governmental contracts, seizure of shipments and loss of import and export privileges. 17Table of ContentsAny failure to comply with current and future regulations in the countries where we operate could subject us to future liabilities. In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities, construct new facilities, or compete in certain markets or could require us to incur significant expenses in order to maintain compliance. Accordingly, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected by our non-compliance with applicable regulations, by any significant limitations on our business as a result of our inability to comply with applicable regulations, or by any requirement that we spend substantial amounts of capital to comply with such regulations.Our operations are subject to political and economic instability and risk of government actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. We are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries in which we operate. Our operations are subject to various risks unique to each country that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. With respect to any particular country, these risks may include:•political and economic instability, including:    ◦civil unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war, other armed conflict, and sanctions;◦inflation; and◦currency fluctuations, devaluations, and conversion restrictions; and•governmental actions that may:    ◦result in expropriation and nationalization of our assets in that country;◦result in confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies;◦limit or disrupt markets or our operations, restrict payments, or limit the movement of funds;◦result in the deprivation of contract rights; and◦result in the inability to obtain or retain licenses required for operation.Liabilities under environmental, health and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability.We are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulation in the countries where our manufacturing facilities are located. Any failure to comply with current and future environmental and safety regulations could subject us to significant liabilities. In particular, any failure to control the discharge of hazardous materials and wastes could subject us to significant liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.We and all our activities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations, including but not limited to, noise abatement and air emissions regulations, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, regulations issued and laws enforced by the labor and employment departments of the U.S. and the states in which we conduct business, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  In Germany, we and all our activities are subject to various safety and environmental regulations of the federal state which are enforced by the local authorities, including the Federal Act on Emission Control (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz).  The Federal Act on Emission Control permits are held by companies jointly owned by DynaEnergetics and the other companies that are located at the Troisdorf manufacturing site and are for an indefinite period of time.  In France, we and all our activities are subject to state environmental and safety regulations established by various departments of the French Government, including the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Ecology and the Ministry of Industry, and to local environmental and safety regulations and administrative procedures established by DRIRE (Direction Régionale de l’Industrie, de la Recherche et de l’Environnement) and the Préfecture des Pyrénées Orientales.  In addition, our shooting operations in France may be particularly vulnerable to noise abatement regulations because these operations are primarily conducted outdoors. The Dillenburg, Germany facility is operated based on a specific permit granted by the local mountain authority and must be renewed every three years.Changes in or compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require modifications to our facilities. Any actual or alleged violations of environmental, health or safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability under applicable law.  Under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our facilities and at third party waste disposal sites, even where such contamination was caused by a predecessor.  We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage.  Accordingly, environmental, health or safety matters may result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities.18Table of ContentsOur failure to comply with Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other laws could have a negative impact on our ongoing operations.We are subject to complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, and various other anti-bribery and anticorruption laws. The internal controls, policies and procedures, and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations. Any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Violations of international and U.S. laws and regulations may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business, operating results and financial condition.Changes in or interpretation of tax law and currency/repatriation control could impact the determination of our income tax liabilities for a tax year. We have worldwide operations.  Consequently, we are subject to the jurisdiction of a significant number of taxing authorities. The income earned in these various jurisdictions is taxed on differing bases, including net income actually earned, net income deemed earned, and revenue-based tax withholding.  The final determination of our income tax liabilities involves the interpretation of local tax laws, tax treaties, and related authorities in each jurisdiction, as well as the use of estimates and assumptions regarding the scope of future operations and results achieved and the timing and nature of income earned and expenditures incurred.  Changes in the operating environment, including changes in or interpretation of tax law and currency/repatriation controls, could impact the determination of our income tax liabilities for a tax year.Work stoppages and other labor relations matters may make it substantially more difficult or expensive for us to produce our products, which could result in decreased sales or increased costs, either of which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to the risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters, particularly in Germany and France, where some of our employees are unionized. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we experienced a total of 11 days work stoppage at our facility in Rivesaltes, France related to the consolidation program of NobelClad's European explosion welding operations.  The employees at our U.S. manufacturing facilities are not unionized. While we believe our relations with employees are good, any prolonged work stoppage or strike at any one of our principal facilities could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  We are subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future.   We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to litigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings with other parties. Managing or defending such legal proceedings may result in substantial legal fees, expenses and costs and diversion of management resources.  If decided adversely to DMC, these legal proceedings, or others that could be brought against us in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. For a more detailed discussion of pending litigation, see Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.   In the event of a dispute arising at our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels, or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. Our inability to enforce our rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Our failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position. We rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our services and products. We may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future, and these rights could be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our services and products may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Our failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position. Our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.19Table of ContentsWe may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights.The tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims, such as those raised in the ongoing GEODynamics litigation, generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business. Royalty payments under licenses from third parties, if available, would increase our costs. Additionally, developing non-infringing technologies would increase our costs. If a license were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are dependent upon information technology systems, which are subject to disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration.   We are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our operations. Our information technology systems are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.   We could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into our operations. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to system implementation and modification, but system modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could, if not successfully implemented, adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. To the extent that we seek to expand our business through acquisitions, we may experience issues in executing acquisitions or integrating acquired operations.   From time to time, we examine opportunities to make selective acquisitions in order to provide increased returns to our shareholders and to expand our operations and, potentially, generate synergies. The success of any acquisition would depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:   •Identifying suitable candidates for acquisition and negotiating acceptable terms; •Obtaining approval from regulatory authorities and potentially DMC’s shareholders; •Maintaining our financial and strategic focus and avoiding distraction of management during the process of integrating the acquired business; •Implementing our standards, controls, procedures and policies at the acquired business and addressing any pre-existing liabilities or claims involving the acquired business; and •To the extent the acquired operations are in a country in which we have not operated historically, understanding the regulations and challenges of operating in that new jurisdiction.     There can be no assurance that we will be able to conclude any acquisitions successfully or that any acquisition will achieve the anticipated synergies or other positive results. Any material problems that we encounter in connection with such an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls, our operating results and financial condition could be harmed.In early 2015, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and at that time restated our previously-issued financial statements included in our 2014 annual report on Form 10-K.  Such material weaknesses were remediated; however, we continue to be subject to a number of requirements as a public company, including the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the ""Sarbanes-Oxley Act"") and the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market. These requirements have placed significant demands on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act 20Table of Contentsrequires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things that our internal control over financial reporting be assessed by management and attested to by our auditors as of December 31 of each year. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, significant resources and management oversight are required. As a result, our management's attention might be diverted from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we experience a material weakness, investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting, particularly if such weakness results in a restatement of our financial results, and our stock price could decline. For more information relating to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, see Part II, Item 9A, “Controls and Procedures.”Risk Factors
 Related to Our Common StockThe price of our common stock may be volatile, which may make it difficult for you to resell the common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive.   The market price and volume of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations, business prospects or liquidity. Among the factors that could affect the price of our common stock are: •changes in the oil and gas, industrial, or infrastructure markets; •operating and financial performance that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors; •developments in our business or in our business sectors generally; •regulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations; •the operating and stock price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;•announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors;•our ability to integrate and operate the companies and the businesses that we acquire; and•changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity, credit or asset valuations or volatility.  The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has at times been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Holders of our common stock may not receive dividends.   Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Under Delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be impaired. Our ability to pay dividends will be subject to our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as our compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future indebtedness. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and our Board of Directors may modify the dividend policy or reduce, defer or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future.  21Table of Contents"

 Risk Factors
 Related to our NobelClad Segment NobelClad operates a cyclical business and its sales are down significantly from its 2008 peak.   NobelClad operates a somewhat cyclical business.  NobelClad revenues are affected both by the demand for NobelClad’s explosion-welded cladding services and the base price of metal used in explosion-welded cladding operations.  Higher metal prices make it more economical for customers to use cladding on less-expensive metal than using solid metal plates.  Higher metal prices also lead to higher sales (in terms of dollars rather than square meters of cladding) and generally higher margins for NobelClad.  Year-end backlog was $36.9 million, $41.2 million, and $41.8 million, respectively, in 2013, 2014 and 2015.12The explosion-welded cladding market is dependent upon sales of products for use by customers in a limited number of heavy industries, including oil and gas, chemicals and petrochemicals, alternative energy, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation, and industrial refrigeration.  These industries tend to be cyclical in nature and an economic slowdown in one or all of these industries-whether due to traditional cyclicality, general economic conditions or other factors-could impact capital expenditures within that industry.  If demand from such industries were to decline or to experience reduced growth rates, our sales would be expected to be affected proportionately, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our revenue and margins are also affected by the price of the base metals we use; lower prices generally lead to lower revenue and often lower margins. Our backlog figures may not accurately predict future sales. We define “backlog” at any given point in time to consist of all firm, unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time.  We expect to fill most items of backlog within the following 12 months.  However, since orders may be rescheduled or canceled and a significant portion of our net sales is derived from a small number of customers, backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels.  Moreover, we cannot be sure of when during the future 12-month period we will be able to recognize revenue corresponding to our backlog nor can we be certain that revenues corresponding to our backlog will not fall into periods beyond the 12-month horizon.  The percentage increase or decrease in NobelClad's annual sales may be substantially greater or less than the change in backlog at the previous year-end. There is a limited availability of sites suitable for cladding operations. Our cladding process involves the detonation of large amounts of explosives. As a result, the sites where we perform cladding must meet certain criteria, including adequate distance from densely populated areas, the specific geological characteristics of the site, and the ability to comply with local noise and vibration abatement regulations in conducting the process. In addition, our primary U.S. shooting site is subleased under an arrangement pursuant to which we provide certain contractual services to the sub-landlord.  The efforts to identify suitable sites and obtain permits for using the sites from local government agencies can be time-consuming and may not be successful.  In addition, we could experience difficulty in obtaining or renewing permits because of resistance from residents in the vicinity of proposed sites.  The failure to obtain required governmental approvals or permits could limit our ability to expand our cladding business in the future, and the failure to maintain such permits or satisfy other conditions to use the sites would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The use of explosives subjects us to additional regulation, and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities. Our operations involve the detonation of large amounts of explosives.  As a result, we are required to use specific safety precautions under U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration guidelines and guidelines of similar entities in Germany and France.  These include precautions which must be taken to protect employees from exposure to sound and ground vibration or falling debris associated with the detonation of explosives.  There is a risk that an accident or death could occur in one of our facilities.  Any accident could result in significant manufacturing delays, disruption of operations or claims for damages resulting from death or injuries, which could result in decreased sales and increased expenses. To date, we have not incurred any significant delays, disruptions or claims resulting from accidents at our facilities.  The potential liability resulting from any accident or death, to the extent not covered by insurance, may require us to use other funds to satisfy our obligations and could cause our business to suffer.  See “Our use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity that could lead to temporary or permanent closure of our NobelClad shooting sites or DynaEnergetics manufacturing facilities” under ""Risk Factors
 Related to Dynamic Materials Corporation"" below. Certain raw materials NobelClad uses are subject to price increases due to general economic conditions. The markets for certain metals and other raw materials used by NobelClad are highly variable and are characterized by periods of increasing prices.  While prices for much of the raw materials we use have recently decreased, we may again experience increasing prices.  We generally do not hedge commodity prices or enter into forward supply contracts; instead we endeavor to pass along price variations to our customers.  We may see a general downturn in business if the price of raw materials increases enough for our customers to delay planned projects or use alternative materials to complete their projects. Risk Factors
 Related to DynaEnergetics Prices and pricing trends of oil and natural gas affect the level of exploration, development, and production activity of DynaEnergetics’ customers.  The steep decline in oil and gas prices since the middle of 2014 has13adversely affected DynaEnergetics’ sales and economic performance. The oil and gas industry is unpredictable and has historically been subject to occasional downturns.  Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control.  Demand for DynaEnergetics’ products is linked to the level of exploration, development, and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies and oilfield services companies.  With the worldwide decrease in oil prices and the increased supply levels of these resources, drilling for new wells has decreased sharply.  For example, rig count in the United States and Canada at the end of 2015 is down approximately 68% from the highest level during 2014.  DynaEnergetics’ revenues in 2015 were 27.0% less than in 2014.  Any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices or expectations about lower future prices will depress the immediate levels of exploration, development, and production activity, which negatively impacts DynaEnergetics’ sale of products and economic performance. The adoption of any future laws or regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting or banning, the hydraulic fracturing process could cause a decrease in natural gas and oil well perforating and could materially adversely affect DynaEnergetics’ sales and economic performance.DynaEnergetic’s perforating products are used for oil and gas well hydraulic fracturing processes, among other uses. Various federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives have been undertaken, which could result in additional requirements or restrictions being imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations. The adoption of these or other laws or implementation of regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting or banning, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to use hydraulic fracking for natural gas and oil well development, which would reduce the demand for some of DynaEnergetic’s products and could have a material adverse effect on its sales and financial performance.DynaEnergetics’ continued economic success depends on remaining at the forefront of innovation in the perforating industry. DynaEnergetics’ position in the perforation market depends in part on its ability to remain an innovative leader in the field.  The ability to remain competitive depends in part on the retention of talented personnel.  DynaEnergetics may be unable to remain an innovative leader in the perforation market segment or may be unable to retain top talent in the field.DynaEnergetics’ growth and market position relies on the development of demand for its innovative new technologies and products.DynaEnergetics is developing new and innovative products, including its DynaStage factory assembled perforating system, which it believes will drive sales at improved margins and improve its position as a technology-focused leader in the perforating market.  To the extent the market for DynaStage and other new technologies and products does not develop from its existing and target customers as expected, DynaEnergetic’s growth and market position may be diminished and may have a material adverse effect on its financial position.The manufacturing of explosives subjects DynaEnergetics to various environmental, health and safety laws. DynaEnergetics is subject to a number of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in significant penalties.  DynaEnergetics’ continued success depends on continued compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  In addition, new environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could be passed that could create costly compliance issues.  While DynaEnergetics endeavors to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, compliance with future laws and regulations may not be economically feasible or even possible.

 Related to Dynamic Materials Corporation Our use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity that could lead to temporary or permanent closure of our NobelClad shooting sites and DynaEnergetics manufacturing facilities. We use a large amount of explosives in connection with the creation of clad metals and manufacturing of perforating shaped charges and detonating cord.  The use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity.  Explosions, even if occurring as intended, can lead to damage to the shooting site or manufacturing facility or to equipment used at the facility or injury to persons at the facility. If a person were injured or killed in connection with such explosives, or if equipment at the shooting site or manufacturing facility were damaged or destroyed, we might be required to suspend our operations for a period of time while an investigation is 14undertaken or repairs are made.  Such a delay might impact our ability to meet the demand for our products.  In addition, if a mine were seriously damaged, we might not be able to locate a suitable replacement site to continue our operations.Weakness in the general global economy may adversely affect certain segments of our end market customers and reduce our sales and results of operations. NobelClad supplies products to customers that fabricate industrial equipment for various capital-intensive industries.  Weakness in the general global economy may adversely affect our end market customers, causing them to cancel or postpone new plant or infrastructure construction, expansion, maintenance, or retrofitting projects that use our NobelClad products.  Similarly, any decrease in oil and gas well drilling activities will reduce the sales of our DynaEnergetics products.  The global general economic climate may lessen demand for our products and reduce our sales and results of operations. Our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in annual and quarterly operating results caused by various factors, including the timing and size of significant orders by customers, customer inventory levels, shifts in product mix, acquisitions and divestitures, and general economic conditions.  The upstream oil and gas, oil refinery, chemical and petrochemical, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation, industrial refrigeration and other diversified industries to which we sell our products are, to varying degrees, cyclical and tend to decline in response to overall declines in industrial production.  As a result, our business is also cyclical, and the demand for our products by these customers depends, in part, on overall levels of industrial production. Any future material weakness in demand in any of these industries could materially reduce our revenues and profitability. In addition, the threat of terrorism and other geopolitical uncertainty could have a negative impact on the global economy, the industries we serve and our operating results. We typically do not obtain long-term volume purchase contracts from our customers. Quarterly sales and operating results, therefore, depend on the volume and timing of the orders in our backlog as well as bookings received during the quarter.  Significant portions of our operating expenses are fixed, and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts and product development programs. If sales do not meet our expectations in any given period, the adverse impact on operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust operating expenses sufficiently or quickly enough to compensate for such a shortfall. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results for any future period. Fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock.  See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” We are exposed to potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against the currencies of many of our operating subsidiaries. Many of our operating subsidiaries conduct business in Euros or other foreign currency such as the Russian Ruble.  Sales made in currencies other than U.S. dollars accounted for 23%, 32%, and 36% of total sales for the years ended 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.  Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of any of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience foreign currency translation losses (gains) with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. In addition, our company and our operating subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we or they enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or their respective functional currencies. For example DynaEnergetics KG’s functional currency is Euros, but its sales often occur in U.S. dollars.  Changes in exchange rates with respect to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. In addition, we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to our operating subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities and to the financial results of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of equity.  As a result of foreign currency risk, we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our primary exposure to foreign currency risk is the Euro due to the percentage of our U.S. dollar revenue that is derived from countries where the Euro is the functional currency and the Russian Ruble due to our operations in Tyumen, Siberia.The terms of our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants, the breach of any of which could result in acceleration of payment of our credit facilities.As of December 31, 2015, we had an outstanding balance of approximately $27.5 million on our syndicated credit agreement. This agreement includes various covenants and restrictions and certain of these relate to the incurrence of additional indebtedness; mortgaging and pledging or disposition of major assets. We are also required to maintain certain financial ratios 15on a quarterly basis. A breach of any of these covenants could impair our ability to borrow and could result in acceleration of our obligations to repay our debt, if we are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment from our lenders. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and other provisions of the credit agreement and our other loan agreements.Any failure to remain in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our credit agreement could result in a default, which would, absent a waiver or amendment, require immediate repayment of outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities. We are dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our net sales. A significant portion of our net sales is derived from a relatively small number of customers; therefore, the failure to complete existing contracts on a timely basis, to receive payment for such services in a timely manner, or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect our ability to meet cash requirements exclusively through operating activities. We attempt to minimize the risk of losing customers or specific contracts by continually improving product quality, delivering product on time and competing aggressively on the basis of price.  We expect to continue to depend upon our principal customers for a significant portion of our sales, although our principal customers may not continue to purchase products and services from us at current levels, if at all. The loss of one or more major customers or a change in their buying patterns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In past years, the majority of NobelClad’s revenues have been derived from customers in the oil and gas, chemicals and petrochemicals, alternative energy, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation and industrial refrigeration industries. Economic downturns in these industries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. DynaEnergetics has customers throughout the world.  Economic or political instability in certain regions of the world where DynaEnergetics conducts a significant volume of its business, such as Russia and other oil-producing countries with unsettled economic or political situations, could have a material adverse effect on DynaEnergetics’ business and operating results. Customers have the right to change orders until products are completed. Customers have the right to change orders after they have been placed.  If orders are changed, the extra expenses associated with the change will be passed on to the customer.  However, because a change in an order may delay completion of the project, recognition of income for the project may also be delayed. There is no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully against other clad and perforating companies. Our explosion-welded clad products compete with explosion-welded clad products made by other manufacturers in the clad metal business located throughout the world and with clad products manufactured using other technologies. Our combined North American and European operations typically supply explosion-welded clad to the worldwide market. There is one other well-known explosion-welded clad supplier worldwide, a division of Asahi-Kasei Corporation of Japan. There are also a number of smaller companies worldwide with explosion-welded clad manufacturing capability, including several companies in China and in South Korea that appear to be growing significantly in their domestic markets.  There are currently no other significant North American based explosion-welded clad suppliers. We focus strongly on reliability, product quality, on-time delivery performance, and low cost manufacturing to minimize the potential of future competitive threats.  However, there is no guarantee we will be able to maintain our competitive position. Explosion-welded clad products also compete with those manufactured by rollbond and weld overlay cladding processes. In rollbond technology, the clad and base metal are bonded together during a hot rolling process in which slab is converted to plate. In weld overlay, which is typically performed by our fabricator customers, the cladding layer is deposited on the base metal through a fusion welding process. The technical and commercial niches of each cladding process are well understood within the industry and vary from one world market location to another.  Our products compete with weld overlay clad products manufactured by a significant number of our fabricator customers. DynaEnergetics competes principally with perforating companies based in North America, South America, and Russia, which produce and market perforating services and products.  DynaEnergetics also competes with oil and gas service companies that are able to satisfy a portion of their perforating needs through in-house production.  To remain competitive, DynaEnergetics must continue to provide innovative products and maintain an excellent reputation for quality, safety, and value.  There can be no assurances that we will continue to compete successfully against these companies.16 Failure to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our current operations. Our continued success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical employees. The loss of services of certain of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such individuals on acceptable terms, if at all; and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Liabilities under environmental and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability. We are subject to extensive environmental and safety regulation in the countries where our manufacturing facilities are located. Any failure to comply with current and future environmental and safety regulations could subject us to significant liabilities. In particular, any failure to control the discharge of hazardous materials and wastes could subject us to significant liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. We and all our activities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations, including but not limited to, noise abatement and air emissions regulations, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, regulations issued and laws enforced by the labor and employment departments of the U.S. and the states in which we conduct business, by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and by state and local health and safety agencies.  In Germany, we and all our activities are subject to various safety and environmental regulations of the federal state which are enforced by the local authorities, including the Federal Act on Emission Control (Bundesimmissionsschutzgesetz).  The Federal Act on Emission Control permits are held by companies jointly owned by DynaEnergetics and the other companies that are located at the Troisdorf manufacturing site and are for an indefinite period of time.  In France, we and all our activities are subject to state environmental and safety regulations established by various departments of the French Government, including the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Ecology and the Ministry of Industry, and to local environmental and safety regulations and administrative procedures established by DRIRE (Direction Régionale de l’Industrie, de la Recherche et de l’Environnement) and the Préfecture des Pyrénées Orientales.  In addition, our shooting operations in France may be particularly vulnerable to noise abatement regulations because these operations are primarily conducted outdoors. The Dillenburg, Germany facility is operated based on a mountain plan (“Bergplan”), which is a specific permit granted by the local mountain authority. This permit must be renewed every three years. Changes in or compliance with environmental and safety laws and regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require modifications to our facilities. Any actual or alleged violations of environmental and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability under applicable law.  Under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our or our predecessor’s past or present facilities and at third party waste disposal sites.  We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage.  Accordingly, environmental, health or safety matters may result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities. We are subject to extensive government regulation and failure to comply could subject us to future liabilities and could adversely affect our ability to conduct or to expand our business. We are subject to extensive government regulation in the United States, Germany, France, Canada, Russia and Kazakhstan, including guidelines and regulations for the safe manufacture, handling, transport and storage of explosives issued by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations set forth by the U.S. Department of Transportation; the Safety Library Publications of the Institute of Makers of Explosive; and similar guidelines of their European counterparts.  In Germany, the transport, storage and use of explosives is governed by a permit issued under the Explosives Act (Sprengstoffgesetz).  In France, the manufacture and transportation of explosives is subcontracted to a third party which is responsible for compliance with regulations established by various State and local governmental agencies concerning the handling and transportation of explosives.  Our French operations could be adversely affected if the third party does not comply with these regulations.  We must comply with licensing and regulations for the purchase, transport, storage, manufacture, handling and use of explosives. In addition, while our shooting facilities in Tautavel, France are located outdoors, our shooting facilities located in Pennsylvania and in Dillenburg, Germany are located in mines, which subject us to certain regulations and oversight of governmental agencies that oversee mines. We are also subject to extensive environmental and occupational safety regulation, as described below under “Liabilities under environmental and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal 17liabilities, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability” and “The use of explosives subjects us to additional regulation, and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities.” The export of certain products from the United States or from foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies is restricted by U.S. and similar foreign export regulations.  These regulations generally prevent the export of products that could be used by certain end users, such as those in the nuclear or biochemical industries.  In addition, the use and handling of explosives may be subject to increased regulation due to heightened concerns about security and terrorism. Such regulations could restrict our ability to access and use explosives and increase costs associated with the use of such explosives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any failure to comply with current and future regulations in the countries where we operate could subject us to future liabilities. In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities, construct new facilities, or compete in certain markets or could require us to incur other significant expenses in order to maintain compliance. Accordingly, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected by our non-compliance with applicable regulations, by any significant limitations on our business as a result of our inability to comply with applicable regulations, or by any requirement that we spend substantial amounts of capital to comply with such regulations.Work stoppages and other labor relations matters may make it substantially more difficult or expensive for us to produce our products, which could result in decreased sales or increased costs, either of which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to the risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters, particularly in Germany and France, where some of our employees are unionized. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we experienced a total of 11 days work stoppage at our facility in Rivesaltes, France related to the consolidation program of NobelClad's European explosion welding operations.  The employees at our U.S. manufacturing facilities are not unionized. While we believe our relations with employees are satisfactory, any prolonged work stoppage or strike at any one of our principal facilities could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Besides the previously mentioned work stoppage at our France facility, we have not experienced a strike or work stoppage at any other location in the last three years.  However, if a work stoppage occurs at one or more of our facilities, it may materially impair our ability to operate our business in the future. The unsuccessful integration of a business we acquire could have a material adverse effect on operating results. We continue to consider possible acquisitions as part of our growth strategy. Any potential acquisition may require additional debt or equity financing, resulting in additional leverage and dilution to existing stockholders. We may be unable to consummate any future acquisition.  If any acquisition is made, we may not be able to integrate such acquisition successfully without a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to the restatement of previously-issued financial statements.  The material weakness could, if not remediated, result in additional material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and in early 2015 restated our previously-issued financial statements included in our 2014 annual report on Form 10-K.  These material weaknesses and the resulting restatement may affect investor confidence in the accuracy of our financial disclosures.  Although we have been working since early 2015 to remedy the ineffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, there can be no assurance as to when the remediation plan will be fully developed, when it will be fully implemented or the aggregate cost of implementation. Until our remediation plan is fully implemented, our management will continue to devote significant time and attention to these efforts. If we do not complete our remediation in a timely fashion, or at all, or if our remediation plan is inadequate, there will continue to be an increased risk of additional material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting, which may also reduce investor confidence in the Company.  For more information relating to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (and disclosure controls and procedures) and the remediation plan undertaken by us, see Part II, Item 9A, “Controls and Procedures.” 18"

 Risk Factors
 Related to our NobelClad Segment NobelClad operates a cyclical business and its sales are down significantly from its 2008 peak.   NobelClad operates a somewhat cyclical business.  Beginning in late 2008 and continuing through 2010, NobelClad's sales in some of its markets slowed down, resulting in declines of 31.2% and 26.5% in 2009 and 2010 sales respectively.  While NobelClad's sales increased in 2011, its annual sales for 2012 and 2013 were 40.9% and 39.3%, respectively, below the amount of its peak sales in 2008.  Its 2014 annual sales (50.2% below peak sales) were the lowest since the 2008 peak.  At December 31, 2007 and 2008, order backlog was $100.0 million and $97.2 million, respectively.  Year-end backlog was $46.4 million, $36.9 million and $41.2 million, respectively, in 2012, 2013 and 2014.  The explosion-welded cladding market is dependent upon sales of products for use by customers in a limited number of heavy industries, including oil and gas, alternative energy, chemicals and petrochemicals, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation, and industrial refrigeration.  These industries tend to be cyclical in nature and an economic slowdown in one or all of these industries-whether due to traditional cyclicality, general economic conditions or other factors-could impact capital expenditures within that industry.  If demand from such industries were to decline or to experience reduced growth rates, our sales would be expected to be affected proportionately, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our backlog figures may not accurately predict future sales. We define “backlog” at any given point in time to consist of all firm, unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time.  Generally speaking, we expect to fill most items of backlog within the following 12 months.  However, since orders may be rescheduled or canceled and a significant portion of our net sales is derived from a small number of customers, backlog is not 13necessarily indicative of future sales levels.  Moreover, we cannot be sure of when during the future 12-month period we will be able to recognize revenue corresponding to our backlog nor can we be certain that revenues corresponding to our backlog will not fall into periods beyond the 12-month horizon.  The percentage increase or decrease in NobelClad's annual sales may be substantially greater or less than the change in backlog at the previous year-end. There is a limited availability of sites suitable for cladding operations. Our cladding process involves the detonation of large amounts of explosives. As a result, the sites where we perform cladding must meet certain criteria, including lack of proximity to a densely populated area, the specific geological characteristics of the site, and the ability to comply with local noise and vibration abatement regulations in conducting the process. In addition, our primary U.S. shooting site is subleased under an arrangement pursuant to which we provide certain contractual services to the sub-landlord.  The efforts to identify suitable sites and obtain permits for using the sites from local government agencies can be time-consuming and may not be successful.  In addition, we could experience difficulty in obtaining or renewing permits because of resistance from residents in the vicinity of proposed sites.  The failure to obtain required governmental approvals or permits could limit our ability to expand our cladding business in the future, and the failure to maintain such permits or satisfy other conditions to use the sites would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The use of explosives subjects us to additional regulation, and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities. Our operations involve the detonation of large amounts of explosives.  As a result, we are required to use specific safety precautions under U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration guidelines and guidelines of similar entities in Germany and France.  These include precautions which must be taken to protect employees from exposure to sound and ground vibration or falling debris associated with the detonation of explosives.  There is a risk that an accident or death could occur in one of our facilities.  Any accident could result in significant manufacturing delays, disruption of operations or claims for damages resulting from death or injuries, which could result in decreased sales and increased expenses. To date, we have not incurred any significant delays, disruptions or claims resulting from accidents at our facilities.  The potential liability resulting from any accident or death, to the extent not covered by insurance, may require us to use other funds to satisfy our obligations and could cause our business to suffer.  See “Our use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity that could lead to temporary or permanent closure of our NobelClad shooting sites or DynaEnergetics manufacturing facilities” under ""Risk Factors
 Related to Dynamic Materials Corporation"" below.Certain raw materials we use are subject to supply shortages due to general economic conditions. Although we generally use standard metals and other materials in manufacturing our products, certain materials such as specific grades of carbon steel, titanium, zirconium and nickel can be subject to supply shortages due to general economic conditions or problems with individual suppliers.  While we seek to maintain sufficient alternative supply sources for these materials, we may not always be able to obtain sufficient supplies or obtain supplies at acceptable prices without production delays, additional costs, or a loss of product quality.  If we were to fail to obtain sufficient supplies on a timely basis or at acceptable prices, such loss or failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Certain raw materials NobelClad uses are subject to price increases due to general economic conditions. The markets for certain metals and other raw materials used by NobelClad are highly variable and are characterized by periods of increasing prices.  While prices for much of the raw materials we use have recently decreased, we may again experience increasing prices.  We generally do not hedge commodity prices or enter into forward supply contracts; instead we endeavor to pass along price variations to our customers.  We may see a general downturn in business if the price of raw materials increases enough for our customers to delay planned projects or use alternative materials to complete their projects. Risk Factors
 Related to DynaEnergetics Prices and pricing trends of oil and natural gas affect the level of exploration, development, and production activity of DynaEnergetics’ customers, which could materially adversely affect DynaEnergetics’ sales and economic performance. The oil and gas industry is unpredictable and has historically been subject to occasional downturns.  Demand for DynaEnergetics’ products is linked to the level of exploration, development, and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies and oilfield services companies.  Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, 14and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control.  Any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices or expectations about lower future prices will depress the immediate levels of exploration, development, and production activity, which could negatively impact DynaEnergetics’ sale of products and economic performance.  The adoption of any future laws or regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting or banning, the hydraulic fracturing process could cause a decrease in natural gas and oil well perforating and could materially adversely affect DynaEnergetics’ sales and economic performance.DynaEnergetic’s perforating products are used for oil and gas well hydraulic fracturing processes, among other uses. Various federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives have been undertaken which could result in additional requirements or restrictions being imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations. The adoption of these or other laws or implementing regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting or banning, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to use hydraulic fracking for natural gas and oil well development, which would reduce the demand for some of DynaEnergetic’s products and could have a material adverse effect on its sales and financial performance.The manufacturing of explosives subjects DynaEnergetics to various environmental, health and safety laws. DynaEnergetics is subject to a number of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in significant penalties.  DynaEnergetics’ continued success depends on continued compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  In addition, new environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could be passed which could create costly compliance issues.  While DynaEnergetics endeavors to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, compliance with future laws and regulations may not be economically feasible or even possible.   If DynaEnergetics is unable to obtain all required permits from governmental agencies it will be unable to begin operations at the manufacturing facility it is constructing in Russia.DynaEnergetics currently imports shaped charges into Russia for sale to its customers and is subject to limitations on the quantities it can import into the country.  As the quantities it may import are expected to be further reduced over the coming years, in 2012 DynaEnergetics acquired property and began constructing a shaped charge manufacturing facility in Tyumen, Siberia, Russia to serve its customers in Russia and neighboring countries.  Construction of the manufacturing facility is nearly complete and DynaEnergetics plans for it to be operational by late 2015.  Before the facility may begin manufacturing explosive shaped charges, however, the Company must receive a number of permits, licenses and other approval from a variety of governmental entities and agencies at the local, state and federal levels.  Regulatory authorities often exercise considerable discretion in the enforcement and interpretation of applicable laws, regulations and standards as well as in approving and issuing permits, licenses and consents, and there can be no assurance that all of the necessary permits, licenses and approvals will be received in a timely manner to permit manufacturing to commence as planned.  Russia is currently experiencing economic and political instability that could affect the functioning of its governmental agencies and regulatory authorities.  If DynaEnergetics experiences a significant delay in commencing its operations, the delay will adversely affect its financial results and its planned strategy to increase sales in the Russian and neighboring countries’ oil and gas market.  Failure to receive all of the necessary permits, licenses and approvals could result in an impairment of the investment in this new manufacturing facility.DynaEnergetics’ continued economic success depends on remaining at the forefront of innovation in the perforating industry. DynaEnergetics’ position in the perforation market depends in part on its ability to remain an innovative leader in the field.  The ability to remain competitive depends in part on the retention of talented personnel.  DynaEnergetics may be unable to remain an innovative leader in the perforation market segment or may be unable to retain top talent in the field.Risk Factors
 Related to Dynamic Materials Corporation Our use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity that could lead to temporary or permanent closure of our NobelClad shooting sites and DynaEnergetics manufacturing facilities. We use a large amount of explosives in connection with the creation of clad metals and manufacturing of perforating shaped charges and detonation cord.  The use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity.  Explosions, even if occurring as intended, can lead to damage to the shooting site or manufacturing facility or to equipment used at the facility or injury to persons at the facility. If a person were injured or killed in connection with such explosives, or if equipment at the shooting site or manufacturing facility were damaged or destroyed, we might be required to suspend our operations for a period of time while an investigation is 15undertaken or repairs are made.  Such a delay might impact our ability to meet the demand for our products.  In addition, if the mine were seriously damaged, we might not be able to locate a suitable replacement site to continue our operations.Weakness in the general global economy may adversely affect certain segments of our end market customers and reduce our sales and results of operations. NobelClad supplies products to customers that fabricate industrial equipment for various capital-intensive industries.  Weakness in the general global economy may adversely affect our end market customers, causing them to cancel or postpone new plant or infrastructure construction, expansion, maintenance, or retrofitting projects that use our NobelClad products.  Similarly, any decrease in oil and gas well drilling activities will reduce the sales of our DynaEnergetics products.  The global general economic climate may lessen demand for our products and reduce our sales and results of operations. Our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in annual and quarterly operating results caused by various factors, including the timing and size of significant orders by customers, customer inventory levels, shifts in product mix, acquisitions and divestitures, and general economic conditions.  The upstream oil and gas, oil refinery, chemical and petrochemical, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation, industrial refrigeration and other diversified industries to which we sell our products are, to varying degrees, cyclical and tend to decline in response to overall declines in industrial production.  As a result, our business is also cyclical, and the demand for our products by these customers depends, in part, on overall levels of industrial production. Any future material weakness in demand in any of these industries could materially reduce our revenues and profitability. In addition, the threat of terrorism and other geopolitical uncertainty could have a negative impact on the global economy, the industries we serve and our operating results. We typically do not obtain long-term volume purchase contracts from our customers. Quarterly sales and operating results, therefore, depend on the volume and timing of the orders in our backlog as well as bookings received during the quarter.  Significant portions of our operating expenses are fixed, and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts and product development programs. If sales do not meet our expectations in any given period, the adverse impact on operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust operating expenses sufficiently or quickly enough to compensate for such a shortfall. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results for any future period. Fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock.  See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” We are exposed to potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against the currencies of many of our operating subsidiaries. Many of our operating subsidiaries conduct business in Euros or other foreign currency such as the Russian Ruble.  Sales made in currencies other than U.S. dollars accounted for 32%, 36%, and 39% of total sales for the years ended 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.  Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of any of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience foreign currency translation losses (gains) with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. In addition, our company and our operating subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we or they enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or their respective functional currencies. For example DYNAenergetics KG’s functional currency is Euros, but its sales often occur in U.S. dollars.  Changes in exchange rates with respect to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. In addition, we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to our operating subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities and to the financial results of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of equity.  As a result of foreign currency risk, we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our primary exposure to foreign currency risk is the Euro due to the percentage of our U.S. dollar revenue that is derived from countries where the Euro is the functional currency and the Russian Ruble due to our greenfield investment in Tyumen, Siberia.We are dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our net sales. A significant portion of our net sales is derived from a relatively small number of customers; therefore, the failure to complete existing contracts on a timely basis, to receive payment for such services in a timely manner, or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect our ability to meet cash requirements exclusively through operating activities. We attempt to minimize the risk of losing customers or specific contracts by continually improving product quality, 16delivering product on time and competing aggressively on the basis of price.  We expect to continue to depend upon our principal customers for a significant portion of our sales, although our principal customers may not continue to purchase products and services from us at current levels, if at all. The loss of one or more major customers or a change in their buying patterns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In past years, the majority of NobelClad’s revenues have been derived from customers in the oil and gas, alternative energy, chemicals and petrochemicals, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation and industrial refrigeration industries. Economic downturns in these industries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. DynaEnergetics has customers throughout the world.    Economic or political instability in certain regions of the world where DynaEnergetics conducts a significant volume of its business, such as Russia and other oil-producing countries with unsettled economic or political situations, could have a material adverse effect on DynaEnergetics’ business and operating results. Customers have the right to change orders until products are completed. Customers have the right to change orders after they have been placed.  If orders are changed, the extra expenses associated with the change will be passed on to the customer.  However, because a change in an order may delay completion of the project, recognition of income for the project may also be delayed. There is no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully against other clad and perforating companies. Our explosion-welded clad products compete with explosion-welded clad products made by other manufacturers in the clad metal business located throughout the world and with clad products manufactured using other technologies. Our combined North American and European operations typically supply explosion-welded clad to the worldwide market. There is one other well-known explosion-welded clad supplier worldwide, a division of Asahi-Kasei Corporation of Japan. There are also a number of smaller companies worldwide with explosion-welded clad manufacturing capability, including several companies in China and in South Korea that appear to be growing significantly in their domestic market.  There are currently no other significant North American based explosion-welded clad suppliers. We focus strongly on reliability, product quality, on-time delivery performance, and low cost manufacturing to minimize the potential of future competitive threats.  However, there is no guarantee we will be able to maintain our competitive position. Explosion-welded clad products also compete with those manufactured by rollbond and weld overlay cladding processes. In rollbond technology, the clad and base metal are bonded together during a hot rolling process in which slab is converted to plate. In weld overlay, which is typically performed by our fabricator customers, the cladding layer is deposited on the base metal through a fusion welding process. The technical and commercial niches of each cladding process are well understood within the industry and vary from one world market location to another.  Our products compete with weld overlay clad products manufactured by a significant number of our fabricator customers. DynaEnergetics competes principally with perforating companies based in North America, South America, and Russia who produce and market perforating services and products.  DynaEnergetics also competes with oil and gas service companies who are able to satisfy a portion of their perforating needs through in-house production.  To remain competitive, DynaEnergetics must continue to provide innovative products and maintain an excellent reputation for quality, safety, and value.  There can be no assurances that we will continue to compete successfully against these companies. Failure to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our current operations. Our continued success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical employees. The loss of services of certain of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such individuals on acceptable terms, if at all; and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Liabilities under environmental and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability. We are subject to extensive environmental and safety regulation in the countries where our manufacturing facilities are located. Any failure to comply with current and future environmental and safety regulations could subject us to significant liabilities. In particular, any failure to control the discharge of hazardous materials and wastes could subject us to significant liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.17 We and all our activities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations, including but not limited to, noise abatement and air emissions regulations, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, regulations issued and laws enforced by the labor and employment departments of the U.S. and the states in which we conduct business, by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and by state and local health and safety agencies.  In Germany, we and all our activities are subject to various safety and environmental regulations of the federal state which are enforced by the local authorities, including the Federal Act on Emission Control (Bundesimmissionsschutzgesetz).  The Federal Act on Emission Control permits are held by companies jointly owned by DYNAenergetics and the other companies that are located at the Würgendorf and Troisdorf manufacturing sites and are for an indefinite period of time.  In France, we and all our activities are subject to state environmental and safety regulations established by various departments of the French Government, including the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Ecology and the Ministry of Industry, and to local environmental and safety regulations and administrative procedures established by DRIRE (Direction Régionale de l’Industrie, de la Recherche et de l’Environnement) and the Préfecture des Pyrénées Orientales.  In addition, our shooting operations in France may be particularly vulnerable to noise abatement regulations because these operations are primarily conducted outdoors. The Dillenburg, Germany facility is operated based on a mountain plan (“Bergplan”), which is a specific permit granted by the local mountain authority. This permit must be renewed every three years. Changes in or compliance with environmental and safety laws and regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require modifications to our facilities. Any actual or alleged violations of environmental and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability under applicable law.  Under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our or our predecessor’s past or present facilities and at third party waste disposal sites.  We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage.  Accordingly, environmental, health or safety matters may result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities. We are subject to extensive government regulation and failure to comply could subject us to future liabilities and could adversely affect our ability to conduct or to expand our business. We are subject to extensive government regulation in the United States, Germany, France, Canada, Russia and Kazakhstan, including guidelines and regulations for the safe manufacture, handling, transport and storage of explosives issued by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations set forth by the U.S. Department of Transportation; the Safety Library Publications of the Institute of Makers of Explosive; and similar guidelines of their European counterparts.  In Germany, the transport, storage and use of explosives is governed by a permit issued under the Explosives Act (Sprengstoffgesetz).  In France, the manufacture and transportation of explosives is subcontracted to a third party which is responsible for compliance with regulations established by various State and local governmental agencies concerning the handling and transportation of explosives.  Our French operations could be adversely affected if the third party does not comply with these regulations.  We must comply with licensing and regulations for the purchase, transport, storage, manufacture, handling and use of explosives. In addition, while our shooting facilities in Tautavel, France are located outdoors, our shooting facilities located in Pennsylvania and in Dillenburg, Germany are located in mines, which subject us to certain regulations and oversight of governmental agencies that oversee mines. We are also subject to extensive environmental and occupational safety regulation, as described below under “Liabilities under environmental and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability” and “The use of explosives subjects us to additional regulation, and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities.” The export of certain products from the United States or from foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies is restricted by U.S. and similar foreign export regulations.  These regulations generally prevent the export of products that could be used by certain end users, such as those in the nuclear or biochemical industries.  In addition, the use and handling of explosives may be subject to increased regulation due to heightened concerns about security and terrorism. Such regulations could restrict our ability to access and use explosives and increase costs associated with the use of such explosives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any failure to comply with current and future regulations in the countries where we operate could subject us to future liabilities. In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities, construct new facilities, or compete in certain markets or could require us to incur other significant expenses in order to maintain compliance. Accordingly, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected by our non-compliance with applicable regulations, by any significant limitations on our business as a result of our inability to comply with applicable regulations, or by any requirement that we spend substantial amounts of capital to comply with such regulations.18Work stoppages and other labor relations matters may make it substantially more difficult or expensive for us to produce our products, which could result in decreased sales or increased costs, either of which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to the risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters, particularly in Germany and France, where some of our employees are unionized. We recently experienced a total of eleven days work stoppage at our facility in Rivesaltes, France related to the consolidated program of NobelClad's European explosion welding operations.  The employees at our U.S. and Canadian facilities, where a significant portion of our products are manufactured, are not unionized. While we believe our relations with employees are satisfactory, any prolonged work stoppage or strike at any one of our principal facilities could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Besides the work stoppage at our France facility previously mentioned, we have not experienced a strike or work stoppage at any other location in the last 3 years.  However, if a work stoppage occurs at one or more of our facilities, it may materially impair our ability to operate our business in the future. The terms of our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants, the breach of any of which could result in acceleration of payment of our credit facilities. We are parties to a syndicated credit agreement that, as of December 31, 2014, had an outstanding balance of approximately $22.8 million.  This credit agreement was amended and restated in February 2015.  Our credit agreement includes various covenants and restrictions, certain of which relate to the incurrence of additional indebtedness; mortgaging and pledging or disposition of major assets.  We are also required to maintain certain financial ratios on a quarterly basis.  A breach of any of these covenants could result in acceleration of our obligations to repay our debt.  As of December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and other provisions of the credit agreement and our other loan agreements.  However, our ability to comply with these covenants and ratios may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. Any failure to remain in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our credit agreement could result in a default which would, absent a waiver or amendment, require immediate repayment of outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities.  It may be difficult to liquidate assets sufficient to immediately repay our outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility. The unsuccessful integration of a business we acquire could have a material adverse effect on operating results. We continue to consider possible acquisitions as part of our growth strategy. Any potential acquisition may require additional debt or equity financing, resulting in additional leverage and dilution to existing stockholders. We may be unable to consummate any future acquisition.  If any acquisition is made, we may not be able to integrate such acquisition successfully without a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to the restatement of previously-issued financial statements.  The material weakness could, if not remediated, result in additional material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. We have identified material material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and have restated our previously-issued financial statements.  These material weaknesses and the resulting restatement may affect investor confidence in the accuracy of our financial disclosures.  Although we are working to remedy the ineffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, there can be no assurance as to when the remediation plan will be fully developed, when it will be fully implemented or the aggregate cost of implementation. Until our remediation plan is fully implemented, our management will continue to devote significant time and attention to these efforts. If we do not complete our remediation in a timely fashion, or at all, or if our remediation plan is inadequate, there will continue to be an increased risk of additional material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting, which may also reduce investor confidence in the Company.  For more information relating to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (and disclosure controls and procedures) and the remediation plan undertaken by us, see Part II, Item 9A, “Controls and Procedures.” 19"

 Risk Factors
 Related to our NobelClad Segment NobelClad operates a cyclical business and its sales are only slowly improving from the significant decline in sales experienced in 2009 and 2010. NobelClad operates a somewhat cyclical business.  Beginning in late 2008 and continuing through 2010, NobelClad's sales in some of its markets slowed down, resulting in declines of 31.2% and 26.5% in year-to-date 2009 and 2010 sales respectively.  While NobelClad's sales increased in 2011, its annual sales for 2011, 2012 and 2013 were 35.3%, 40.9% and 39.4%, respectively, below the amount of its peak sales in 2008.  At December 31, 2007 and 2008, order backlog was $100.0 million and $97.2 million, respectively.  Year-end backlog was $49.6 million, $56.5 million, $44.6 million, $46.4 million and $39.9 million, respectively, in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013.  The explosion-weld cladding market is dependent upon sales of products for use by customers in a limited number of heavy industries, including oil and gas, alternative energy, chemicals and petrochemicals, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation, and industrial refrigeration.  These industries tend to be cyclical in nature and an economic slowdown in one or all of these industries—whether due to traditional cyclicality, general economic conditions or other factors—could impact capital expenditures within that industry.  If demand from such industries were to decline or to experience reduced growth rates, our sales would be expected to be affected proportionately, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our backlog figures may not accurately predict future sales. We define “backlog” at any given point in time to consist of all firm, unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time.  Generally speaking, we expect to fill most items of backlog within the following 12 months.  However, since orders may be rescheduled or canceled and a significant portion of our net sales is derived from a small number of customers, backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels.  Moreover, we cannot be sure of when during the future 12-month period we will be able to recognize revenue corresponding to our backlog nor can we be certain that revenues corresponding to our backlog will not fall into periods beyond the 12-month horizon.  The percentage increase or decrease in NobelClad's annual sales may be substantially greater or less than the change in backlog at the previous year-end. There is a limited availability of sites suitable for cladding operations. Our cladding process involves the detonation of large amounts of explosives. As a result, the sites where we perform cladding must meet certain criteria, including lack of proximity to a densely populated area, the specific geological characteristics of the site, and the ability to comply with local noise and vibration abatement regulations in conducting the process. In addition, our primary U.S. shooting site is subleased under an arrangement pursuant to which we provide certain contractual services to the sub-landlord.  The efforts to identify suitable sites and obtain permits for using the sites from local government agencies can be time-consuming and may not be successful.  In addition, we could experience difficulty in obtaining or renewing permits because of resistance from residents in the vicinity of proposed sites.  The failure to obtain required governmental approvals or permits could limit our ability to expand our cladding business in the future, and the failure to maintain such permits or satisfy other conditions to use the sites would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 13The use of explosives subjects us to additional regulation, and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities. Our operations involve the detonation of large amounts of explosives.  As a result, we are required to use specific safety precautions under U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration guidelines and guidelines of similar entities in Germany and France.  These include precautions which must be taken to protect employees from exposure to sound and ground vibration or falling debris associated with the detonation of explosives.  There is a risk that an accident or death could occur in one of our facilities.  Any accident could result in significant manufacturing delays, disruption of operations or claims for damages resulting from death or injuries, which could result in decreased sales and increased expenses. To date, we have not incurred any significant delays, disruptions or claims resulting from accidents at our facilities.  The potential liability resulting from any accident or death, to the extent not covered by insurance, may require us to use other funds to satisfy our obligations and could cause our business to suffer.  See “Our use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity that could lead to temporary or permanent closure of our NobelClad shooting sites or DynaEnergetics manufacturing facilities” under ""Risk Factors
 Related to Dynamic Materials Corporation"" below.Certain raw materials we use are subject to supply shortages due to general economic conditions. Although we generally use standard metals and other materials in manufacturing our products, certain materials such as specific grades of carbon steel, titanium, zirconium and nickel can be subject to supply shortages due to general economic conditions or problems with individual suppliers.  While we seek to maintain sufficient alternative supply sources for these materials, we may not always be able to obtain sufficient supplies or obtain supplies at acceptable prices without production delays, additional costs, or a loss of product quality.  If we were to fail to obtain sufficient supplies on a timely basis or at acceptable prices, such loss or failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Certain raw materials NobelClad uses are subject to price increases due to general economic conditions. The markets for certain metals and other raw materials used by NobelClad are highly variable and are characterized by periods of increasing prices.  While prices for much of the raw materials we use have recently decreased, we may again experience increasing prices.  We generally do not hedge commodity prices or enter into forward supply contracts; instead we endeavor to pass along price variations to our customers.  We may see a general downturn in business if the price of raw materials increases enough for our customers to delay planned projects or use alternative materials to complete their projects. Risk Factors
 Related to DynaEnergetics The manufacturing of explosives subjects DynaEnergetics to various environmental, health and safety laws. DynaEnergetics is subject to a number of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in significant penalties.  DynaEnergetics’ continued success depends on continued compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  In addition, new environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could be passed which could create costly compliance issues.  While DynaEnergetics endeavors to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, compliance with future laws and regulations may not be economically feasible or even possible.   DynaEnergetics’ continued economic success depends on remaining at the forefront of innovation in the perforating industry. DynaEnergetics’ position in the perforation market depends in part on its ability to remain an innovative leader in the field.  The ability to remain competitive depends in part on the retention of talented personnel.  DynaEnergetics may be unable to remain an innovative leader in the perforation market segment or may be unable to retain top talent in the field.Potential downturns in the oil and gas industry and related services industry could have a negative impact on DynaEnergetics’s economic success. The oil and gas industry is unpredictable and has historically been subject to occasional downturns.   Demand for DynaEnergetics’ products is linked to the financial success of the oil and gas industry as a whole, and downturns in the oil and gas industry, especially in the rate of well drilling, could negatively impact DynaEnergetics’ economic success.  A variety of factors affect the demand for DynaEnergetics products, including governmental regulation of oil and gas industry and markets, international and domestic prices for oil and gas, weather conditions, the financial condition of DynaEnergetics’ clients, and consumption patterns of oil and gas. 14Risk Factors
 Related to Dynamic Materials Corporation Our use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity that could lead to temporary or permanent closure of our NobelClad shooting sites and DynaEnergetics manufacturing facilities. We use a large amount of explosives in connection with the creation of clad metals and manufacturing of perforating shaped charges and detonation cord.  The use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity.  Explosions, even if occurring as intended, can lead to damage to the shooting site or manufacturing facility or to equipment used at the facility or injury to persons at the facility. If a person were injured or killed in connection with such explosives, or if equipment at the shooting site or manufacturing facility were damaged or destroyed, we might be required to suspend our operations for a period of time while an investigation is undertaken or repairs are made.  Such a delay might impact our ability to meet the demand for our products.  In addition, if the mine were seriously damaged, we might not be able to locate a suitable replacement site to continue our operations.Weakness in the general global economy may adversely affect certain segments of our end market customers and reduce our sales and results of operations. We supply products to customers that fabricate industrial equipment for various capital-intensive industries.  Weakness in the general global economy may adversely affect our end market customers, causing them to cancel or postpone new plant or infrastructure construction, expansion, maintenance, or retrofitting projects that use our NobelClad products.  Similarly, any decrease in oil and gas well drilling activities will reduce the sales of our DynaEnergetics products.  Any decrease in the demand for gas turbines and airplane engines will reduce the demand for the work performed by our AMK division.  The global general economic climate may lessen demand for our products and reduce our sales and results of operations. Our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in annual and quarterly operating results caused by various factors, including the timing and size of significant orders by customers, customer inventory levels, shifts in product mix, acquisitions and divestitures, and general economic conditions.  The upstream oil and gas, oil refinery, chemical and petrochemical, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation, industrial refrigeration and other diversified industries to which we sell our products are, to varying degrees, cyclical and tend to decline in response to overall declines in industrial production.  As a result, our business is also cyclical, and the demand for our products by these customers depends, in part, on overall levels of industrial production. Any future material weakness in demand in any of these industries could materially reduce our revenues and profitability. In addition, the threat of terrorism and other geopolitical uncertainty could have a negative impact on the global economy, the industries we serve and our operating results. We typically do not obtain long-term volume purchase contracts from our customers. Quarterly sales and operating results, therefore, depend on the volume and timing of the orders in our backlog as well as bookings received during the quarter.  Significant portions of our operating expenses are fixed, and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts and product development programs. If sales do not meet our expectations in any given period, the adverse impact on operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust operating expenses sufficiently or quickly enough to compensate for such a shortfall. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results for any future period. Fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock.  See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” We are exposed to potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against the currencies of many of our operating subsidiaries. Many of our operating subsidiaries conduct business in Euros or other foreign currency.  Sales made in currencies other than U.S. dollars accounted for 35%, 37%, and 34% of total sales for the years ended 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.  Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of any of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience foreign currency translation losses (gains) with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. In addition, our company and our operating subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we or they enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or their respective functional currencies. For example DYNAenergetics KG’s functional currency is Euros, but its sales often occur in U.S. dollars.  Changes in exchange rates with respect to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. In addition, we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to our operating subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities and to the financial results of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of equity. As a result of 15foreign currency risk, we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The primary exposure to foreign currency risk for us is to the Euro due to the percentage of our U.S. dollar revenue that is derived from countries where the Euro is the functional currency.We are dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our net sales. A significant portion of our net sales is derived from a relatively small number of customers; therefore, the failure to complete existing contracts on a timely basis, to receive payment for such services in a timely manner, or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect our ability to meet cash requirements exclusively through operating activities. We attempt to minimize the risk of losing customers or specific contracts by continually improving product quality, delivering product on time and competing aggressively on the basis of price.  We expect to continue to depend upon our principal customers for a significant portion of our sales, although our principal customers may not continue to purchase products and services from us at current levels, if at all. The loss of one or more major customers or a change in their buying patterns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In past years, the majority of NobelClad’s revenues have been derived from customers in the oil and gas, alternative energy, chemicals and petrochemicals, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation and industrial refrigeration industries and the majority of AMK Technical Services’ revenues have been derived from customers in the aircraft engine and power generation industries. Economic downturns in these industries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. DynaEnergetics, which contributed approximately 39% to our 2012 sales, has customers throughout the world.    Economic or political instability in certain regions of the world where DynaEnergetics conducts a significant volume of its business, such as Russia, could have a material adverse effect on DynaEnergetics’ business and operating results. AMK Technical Services, contributed approximately 4% to our 2012 sales, continues to rely primarily on one customer for the majority of its sales. This customer and AMK Technical Services have entered into a long-term supply agreement for certain of the services provided to this customer.  Any termination of or significant reduction in AMK Technical Services’ business relationship with this customer could have a material adverse effect on AMK Technical Services’ business and operating results.Customers have the right to change orders until products are completed. Customers have the right to change orders after they have been placed.  If orders are changed, the extra expenses associated with the change will be passed on to the customer.  However, because a change in an order may delay completion of the project, recognition of income for the project may also be delayed. There is no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully against other clad, perforating, and welding companies. Our explosion-welded clad products compete with explosion-welded clad products made by other manufacturers in the clad metal business located throughout the world and with clad products manufactured using other technologies. Our combined North American and European operations typically supply explosion-welded clad to the worldwide market. There is one other well-known explosion-welded clad supplier worldwide, a division of Asahi-Kasei Corporation of Japan. There are also a number of smaller companies worldwide with explosion-welded clad manufacturing capability, including several companies in China that appear to be growing significantly in their domestic market.  There are currently no other significant North American based explosion-welded clad suppliers. We focus strongly on reliability, product quality, on-time delivery performance, and low cost manufacturing to minimize the potential of future competitive threats.  However, there is no guarantee we will be able to maintain our competitive position. Explosion-welded clad products also compete with those manufactured by rollbond and weld overlay cladding processes. In rollbond technology, the clad and base metal are bonded together during a hot rolling process in which slab is converted to plate. In weld overlay, which is typically performed by our fabricator customers, the cladding layer is deposited on the base metal through a fusion welding process. The technical and commercial niches of each cladding process are well understood within the industry and vary from one world market location to another.  Our products compete with weld overlay clad products manufactured by a significant number of our fabricator customers. DynaEnergetics competes principally with perforating companies based in North America, South America, and Russia who produce and market perforating services and products.  DynaEnergetics also competes with oil and gas service companies who are able to satisfy a portion of their perforating needs through in-house production.  To remain competitive, DynaEnergetics must 16continue to provide innovative products and maintain an excellent reputation for quality, safety, and value.  There can be no assurances that we will continue to compete successfully against these companies. AMK Technical Services competes principally with other domestic companies that provide welding services to the aircraft engine and power generation industries.  Some of these competitors have established positions in the market and long standing relationships with customers. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop and provide technologically advanced welding, heat-treat and inspection services, maintain quality levels, offer flexible delivery schedules, and compete favorably on the basis of price. We compete against other welding companies on the basis of quality, performance and cost. There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully against these companies.Failure to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our current operations. Our continued success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical employees. The loss of services of certain of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such individuals on acceptable terms, if at all; and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Liabilities under environmental and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability. We are subject to extensive environmental and safety regulation in the countries where our manufacturing facilities are located. Any failure to comply with current and future environmental and safety regulations could subject us to significant liabilities. In particular, any failure to control the discharge of hazardous materials and wastes could subject us to significant liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. We and all our activities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations, including but not limited to, noise abatement and air emissions regulations, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, regulations issued and laws enforced by the labor and employment departments of the U.S. and the states in which we conduct business, by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and by state and local health and safety agencies.  In Germany, we and all our activities are subject to various safety and environmental regulations of the federal state which are enforced by the local authorities, including the Federal Act on Emission Control (Bundesimmissionsschutzgesetz).  The Federal Act on Emission Control permits are held by companies jointly owned by DYNAenergetics and the other companies that are located at the Würgendorf and Troisdorf manufacturing sites and are for an indefinite period of time.  In France, we and all our activities are subject to state environmental and safety regulations established by various departments of the French Government, including the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Ecology and the Ministry of Industry, and to local environmental and safety regulations and administrative procedures established by DRIRE (Direction Régionale de l’Industrie, de la Recherche et de l’Environnement) and the Préfecture des Pyrénées Orientales.  In addition, our shooting operations in Germany and France may be particularly vulnerable to noise abatement regulations because these operations are primarily conducted outdoors. The Dillenburg, Germany facility is operated based on a mountain plan (“Bergplan”), which is a specific permit granted by the local mountain authority. This permit must be renewed every three years. Changes in or compliance with environmental and safety laws and regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require modifications to our facilities. Any actual or alleged violations of environmental and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability under applicable law.  Under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our or our predecessor’s past or present facilities and at third party waste disposal sites.  We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage.  Accordingly, environmental, health or safety matters may result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities. We are subject to extensive government regulation and failure to comply could subject us to future liabilities and could adversely affect our ability to conduct or to expand our business. We are subject to extensive government regulation in the United States, Germany, France, Canada, Russia and Kazakhstan, including guidelines and regulations for the safe manufacture, handling, transport and storage of explosives issued by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations set forth by the U.S. Department of Transportation; the Safety Library Publications of the Institute of Makers of Explosive; and similar guidelines of their European counterparts.  In Germany, the transport, storage and use of explosives is governed by a permit issued under the Explosives Act (Sprengstoffgesetz).  In France, the manufacture and transportation of explosives is subcontracted to a third party which is responsible for compliance with regulations established by various State and local governmental agencies concerning the handling 17and transportation of explosives.  Our French operations could be adversely affected if the third party does not comply with these regulations.  We must comply with licensing and regulations for the purchase, transport, storage, manufacture, handling and use of explosives. In addition, while our shooting facilities in Würgendorf and Troisdorf, Germany and Tautavel, France are located outdoors, our shooting facilities located in Pennsylvania and in Dillenburg, Germany are located in mines, which subject us to certain regulations and oversight of governmental agencies that oversee mines. We are also subject to extensive environmental and occupational safety regulation, as described below under “Liabilities under environmental and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability” and “The use of explosives subjects us to additional regulation, and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities.” The export of certain products from the United States or from foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies is restricted by U.S. and similar foreign export regulations.  These regulations generally prevent the export of products that could be used by certain end users, such as those in the nuclear or biochemical industries.  In addition, the use and handling of explosives may be subject to increased regulation due to heightened concerns about security and terrorism. Such regulations could restrict our ability to access and use explosives and increase costs associated with the use of such explosives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any failure to comply with current and future regulations in the countries where we operate could subject us to future liabilities. In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities, construct new facilities, or compete in certain markets or could require us to incur other significant expenses in order to maintain compliance. Accordingly, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected by our non-compliance with applicable regulations, by any significant limitations on our business as a result of our inability to comply with applicable regulations, or by any requirement that we spend substantial amounts of capital to comply with such regulations.Work stoppages and other labor relations matters may make it substantially more difficult or expensive for us to produce our products, which could result in decreased sales or increased costs, either of which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to the risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters, particularly in Germany and France, where some of our employees are unionized. The employees at our U.S. and Canadian facilities, where a significant portion of our products are manufactured, are not unionized. While we believe our relations with employees are satisfactory, any prolonged work stoppage or strike at any one of our principal facilities could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We have not experienced a strike or work stoppage in the last 3 years.  However, if a work stoppage occurs at one or more of our facilities, it may materially impair our ability to operate our business in the future. The terms of our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants, the breach of any of which could result in acceleration of payment of our credit facilities. We are parties to a syndicated credit agreement that, as of December 31, 2013, had an outstanding balance of approximately $29.3 million.  Our credit agreement includes various covenants and restrictions, certain of which relate to the incurrence of additional indebtedness; mortgaging, pledging or disposition of major assets; and limits on capital expenditures and other investments.  We are also required to maintain certain financial ratios on a quarterly basis.  A breach of any of these covenants could result in acceleration of our obligations to repay our debt.  As of December 31, 2012, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and other provisions of the credit agreement and our other loan agreements.  However, our ability to comply with these covenants and ratios may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. Any failure to remain in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our credit agreement could result in a default which would, absent a waiver or amendment, require immediate repayment of outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities.  It may be difficult to liquidate assets sufficient to immediately repay our outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility. The unsuccessful integration of a business we acquire could have a material adverse effect on operating results. We continue to consider possible acquisitions as part of our growth strategy. Any potential acquisition may require additional debt or equity financing, resulting in additional leverage and dilution to existing stockholders. We may be unable to consummate any future acquisition.  If any acquisition is made, we may not be able to integrate such acquisition successfully without a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.18"

 Risk Factors
 Related to our Explosive Metalworking Segment Business has slowed down in some of our markets and we experienced a significant decline in 2009 and 2010 sales that is increasing only slowly. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we began to see a slowdown in Nobelclad sales to some of the markets we serve which continued into 2009 and 2010 and contributed to declines of 31.2% and 26.5% in year-to-year 2009 and 2010 sales, respectively.  Nobelclad experienced a sales recovery in 2011 which led to a 28.0% increase in year-to-year 2011 sales.  Sales for 2012 were down 8.6% compared to 2011.  Our order backlog, which decreased to $49.6 million at December 31, 2009 from $97.2 million at December 31, 2008, rebounded only modestly to $56.5 million at December 31, 2010 before decreasing to $44.6 million at December 31, 2011 and increasing only slightly to $46.4 million at December 31, 2012.  The explosion-weld cladding market is dependent upon sales of products for use by customers in a limited number of heavy industries, including oil and gas, alternative energy, chemicals and petrochemicals, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation, and industrial refrigeration.  These industries tend to be cyclical in  11Table of Contents nature and an economic slowdown in one or all of these industrieswhether due to traditional cyclicality, general economic conditions or other factorscould impact capital expenditures within that industry.  If demand from such industries were to decline or to experience reduced growth rates, our sales would be expected to be affected proportionately, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our backlog figures may not accurately predict future sales. We define backlog at any given point in time to consist of all firm, unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time.  Generally speaking, we expect to fill most items of backlog within the following 12 months.  However, since orders may be rescheduled or canceled and a significant portion of our net sales is derived from a small number of customers, backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels.  Moreover, we cannot be sure of when during the future 12-month period we will be able to recognize revenue corresponding to our backlog nor can we be certain that revenues corresponding to our backlog will not fall into periods beyond the 12-month horizon. There is a limited availability of sites suitable for cladding operations. Our cladding process involves the detonation of large amounts of explosives. As a result, the sites where we perform cladding must meet certain criteria, including lack of proximity to a densely populated area, the specific geological characteristics of the site, and the ability to comply with local noise and vibration abatement regulations in conducting the process. In addition, our primary U.S. shooting site is subleased under an arrangement pursuant to which we provide certain contractual services to the sub-landlord.  The efforts to identify suitable sites and obtain permits for using the sites from local government agencies can be time-consuming and may not be successful.  In addition, we could experience difficulty in obtaining or renewing permits because of resistance from residents in the vicinity of proposed sites.  The failure to obtain required governmental approvals or permits could limit our ability to expand our cladding business in the future, and the failure to maintain such permits or satisfy other conditions to use the sites would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The use of explosives subjects us to additional regulation, and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities. Our operations involve the detonation of large amounts of explosives.  As a result, we are required to use specific safety precautions under U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration guidelines and guidelines of similar entities in Germany and France.  These include precautions which must be taken to protect employees from exposure to sound and ground vibration or falling debris associated with the detonation of explosives.  There is a risk that an accident or death could occur in one of our facilities.  Any accident could result in significant manufacturing delays, disruption of operations or claims for damages resulting from death or injuries, which could result in decreased sales and increased expenses. To date, we have not incurred any significant delays, disruptions or claims resulting from accidents at our facilities.  The potential liability resulting from any accident or death, to the extent not covered by insurance, may require us to use other funds to satisfy our obligations and could cause our business to suffer.  See Our use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity that could lead to temporary or permanent closure of our shooting sites below. Our use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity that could lead to temporary or permanent closure of our shooting sites. We use a large amount of explosives in connection with the creation of clad metals.  The use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity.  Explosions, even if occurring as intended, can lead to damage to the shooting facility or to equipment used at the facility or injury to persons at the facility. If a person were injured or killed in connection with such explosives, or if equipment at the mine or either of the outdoor locations were damaged or destroyed, we might be required to suspend our operations for a period of time while an investigation is undertaken or repairs are made.  Such a delay might impact our ability to meet the demand for our products.  In addition, if the mine were seriously damaged, we might not be able to locate a suitable replacement site to continue our operations. 12Table of Contents Certain raw materials we use are subject to supply shortages due to general economic conditions. Although we generally use standard metals and other materials in manufacturing our products, certain materials such as specific grades of carbon steel, titanium, zirconium and nickel can be subject to supply shortages due to general economic conditions or problems with individual suppliers.  While we seek to maintain sufficient alternative supply sources for these materials, we may not always be able to obtain sufficient supplies or obtain supplies at acceptable prices without production delays, additional costs, or a loss of product quality.  If we were to fail to obtain sufficient supplies on a timely basis or at acceptable prices, such loss or failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Certain raw materials Nobelclad uses are subject to price increases due to general economic conditions. The markets for certain metals and other raw materials used by Nobelclad are highly variable and are characterized by periods of increasing prices.  While prices for much of the raw materials we use have recently decreased, we may again experience increasing prices.  We generally do not hedge commodity prices or enter into forward supply contracts; instead we endeavor to pass along price variations to our customers.  We may see a general downturn in business if the price of raw materials increases enough for our customers to delay planned projects or use alternative materials to complete their projects. Risk Factors
 Related to DYNAenergetics Potential downturns in the oil and gas industry and related services industry could have a negative impact on DYNAenergeticss economic success. The oil and gas industry is unpredictable and has historically been subject to occasional downturns.   Demand for DYNAenergetics products is linked to the financial success of the oil and gas industry as a whole, and downturns in the oil and gas industry, especially in the rate of well drilling, could negatively impact DYNAenergetics economic success.  A variety of factors affect the demand for DYNAenergetics products, including governmental regulation of oil and gas industry and markets, international and domestic prices for oil and gas, weather conditions, the financial condition of DYNAenergetics clients, and consumption patterns of oil and gas. The manufacturing of explosives subjects DYNAenergetics to various environmental, health and safety laws. DYNAenergetics is subject to a number of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in significant penalties.  DYNAenergetics continued success depends on continued compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  In addition, new environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could be passed which could create costly compliance issues.  While DYNAenergetics endeavors to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, compliance with future laws and regulations may not be economically feasible or even possible.  DYNAenergetics is also subject to potential plant stoppages resulting from explosive-related accidents. DYNAenergetics continued economic success depends on remaining at the forefront of innovation in the perforating industry. DYNAenergetics position in the perforation market depends in part on its ability to remain an innovative leader in the field.  The ability to remain competitive depends in part on the retention of talented personnel.  DYNAenergetics may be unable to remain an innovative leader in the perforation market segment or may be unable to retain top talent in the field. 13Table of Contents Risk Factors
 Related to Dynamic Materials Corporation Weakness in the general global economy may adversely affect certain segments of our end market customers and reduce our sales and results of operations. We supply products to customers that fabricate industrial equipment for various capital-intensive industries.  Weakness in the general global economy may adversely affect our end market customers, causing them to cancel or postpone new plant or infrastructure construction, expansion, maintenance, or retrofitting projects that use our Nobelclad products.  Similarly, any decrease in oil and gas well drilling activities will reduce the sales of our DYNAenergetics products.  Any decrease in the demand for gas turbines and airplane engines will reduce the demand for the work performed by our AMK division.  The global general economic climate may lessen demand for our products and reduce our sales and results of operations. Our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in annual and quarterly operating results caused by various factors, including the timing and size of orders by major customers, customer inventory levels, shifts in product mix, acquisitions and divestitures, and general economic conditions.  The upstream oil and gas, oil refinery, chemical and petrochemical, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation, industrial refrigeration and other diversified industries to which we sell our products are, to varying degrees, cyclical and tend to decline in response to overall declines in industrial production.  As a result, our business is also cyclical, and the demand for our products by these customers depends, in part, on overall levels of industrial production. Any future material weakness in demand in any of these industries could materially reduce our revenues and profitability. In addition, the threat of terrorism and other geopolitical uncertainty could have a negative impact on the global economy, the industries we serve and our operating results. We typically do not obtain long-term volume purchase contracts from our customers. Quarterly sales and operating results, therefore, depend on the volume and timing of the orders in our backlog as well as bookings received during the quarter.  Significant portions of our operating expenses are fixed, and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts and product development programs. If sales do not meet our expectations in any given period, the adverse impact on operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust operating expenses sufficiently or quickly enough to compensate for such a shortfall. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results for any future period. Fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock.  See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We are exposed to potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against the currencies of many of our operating subsidiaries. Many of our operating subsidiaries conduct business in Euros or other foreign currency.  Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of any of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience foreign currency translation losses (gains) with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. In addition, our company and our operating subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we or they enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or their respective functional currencies. For example DYNAenergetics KGs functional currency is Euros, but its sales often occur in U.S. dollars.  Changes in exchange rates with respect to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. In addition, we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to our operating subsidiaries assets and liabilities and to the financial results of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of equity. As a result of foreign currency risk, we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The primary exposure to foreign currency risk for us is to the Euro due to the percentage of our U.S. dollar revenue that is derived from countries where the Euro is the functional currency. 14Table of Contents The terms of our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants, the breach of any of which could result in acceleration of payment of our credit facilities. We are parties to a syndicated credit agreement that, as of December 31, 2012, had an outstanding balance of approximately $37.8 million.  Our credit agreement includes various covenants and restrictions, certain of which relate to the incurrence of additional indebtedness; mortgaging, pledging or disposition of major assets; and limits on capital expenditures and other investments.  We are also required to maintain certain financial ratios on a quarterly basis.  A breach of any of these covenants could result in acceleration of our obligations to repay our debt.  As of December 31, 2012, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and other provisions of the credit agreement and our other loan agreements.  However, our ability to comply with these covenants and ratios may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. Any failure to remain in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our credit agreement could result in a default which would, absent a waiver or amendment, require immediate repayment of outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities.  It may be difficult to liquidate assets sufficient to immediately repay our outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility. Customers have the right to change orders until products are completed. Customers have the right to change orders after they have been placed.  If orders are changed, the extra expenses associated with the change will be passed on to the customer.  However, because a change in an order may delay completion of the project, recognition of income for the project may also be delayed. There is no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully against other clad, perforating, and welding companies. Our explosion-welded clad products compete with explosion-welded clad products made by other manufacturers in the clad metal business located throughout the world and with clad products manufactured using other technologies. Our combined North American and European operations typically supply explosion-welded clad to the worldwide market. There is one other well-known explosion-welded clad supplier worldwide, a division of Asahi-Kasei Corporation of Japan. There are also a number of smaller companies worldwide with explosion-welded clad manufacturing capability, including several companies in China.  There are currently no other significant North American based explosion-welded clad suppliers. We focus strongly on reliability, product quality, on-time delivery performance, and low cost manufacturing to minimize the potential of future competitive threats.  However, there is no guarantee we will be able to maintain our competitive position. Explosion-welded clad products also compete with those manufactured by rollbond and weld overlay cladding processes. In rollbond technology, the clad and base metal are bonded together during a hot rolling process in which slab is converted to plate. In weld overlay, which is typically performed by our fabricator customers, the cladding layer is deposited on the base metal through a fusion welding process. The technical and commercial niches of each cladding process are well understood within the industry and vary from one world market location to another.  Our products compete with weld overlay clad products manufactured by a significant number of our fabricator customers. DYNAenergetics competes principally with perforating companies based in North America, South America, and Russia who produce and market perforating services and products.  DYNAenergetics also competes with oil and gas service companies who are able to satisfy a portion of their perforating needs through in-house production.  To remain competitive, DYNAenergetics must continue to provide innovative products and maintain an excellent reputation for quality, safety, and value.  There can be no assurances that we will continue to compete successfully against these companies. AMK Welding competes principally with other domestic companies that provide welding services to the aircraft engine and power generation industries.  Some of these competitors have established positions in the market and long standing relationships with customers. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop and provide technologically advanced welding, heat-treat and inspection services, maintain quality levels, offer flexible delivery schedules, and compete favorably on the basis of price. We compete against other welding companies on the basis of quality, performance and cost. There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully against these companies. 15Table of Contents We are dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our net sales. A significant portion of our net sales is derived from a relatively small number of customers; therefore, the failure to complete existing contracts on a timely basis, to receive payment for such services in a timely manner, or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect our ability to meet cash requirements exclusively through operating activities. We attempt to minimize the risk of losing customers or specific contracts by continually improving product quality, delivering product on time and competing aggressively on the basis of price.  We expect to continue to depend upon our principal customers for a significant portion of our sales, although our principal customers may not continue to purchase products and services from us at current levels, if at all. The loss of one or more major customers or a change in their buying patterns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In past years, the majority of Nobelclads revenues have been derived from customers in the oil and gas, alternative energy, chemicals and petrochemicals, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation and industrial refrigeration industries and the majority of AMK Weldings revenues have been derived from customers in the aircraft engine and power generation industries. Economic downturns in these industries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. DYNAenergetics, which contributed approximately 39% to our 2012 sales, has customers throughout the world.    Economic or political instability in certain regions of the world where DYNAenergetics conducts a significant volume of its business, such as Russia, could have a material adverse effect on DYNAenergetics business and operating results. AMK Welding, contributed approximately 4% to our 2012 sales, continues to rely primarily on one customer for the majority of its sales. This customer and AMK Welding have entered into a long-term supply agreement for certain of the services provided to this customer.  Any termination of or significant reduction in AMK Weldings business relationship with this customer could have a material adverse effect on AMK Weldings business and operating results. Failure to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our current operations. Our continued success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical employees. The loss of services of certain of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such individuals on acceptable terms, if at all; and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Liabilities under environmental and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability. We are subject to extensive environmental and safety regulation in North America and Europe. Any failure to comply with current and future environmental and safety regulations could subject us to significant liabilities. In particular, any failure to control the discharge of hazardous materials and wastes could subject us to significant liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. We and all our activities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations, including but not limited to, noise abatement and air emissions regulations, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, regulations issued and laws enforced by the labor and employment departments of the U.S. and the states in which we conduct business, by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and by state and local health and safety agencies.  In Germany, we and all our activities are subject to various safety and environmental regulations of the federal state which are enforced by the local authorities, including the Federal Act on Emission Control (Bundesimmissionsschutzgesetz).  The Federal Act on Emission Control permits are held by companies jointly owned by DYNAenergetics and the other companies that are located at the Würgendorf and Troisdorf manufacturing sites and are for an indefinite period of time.  In France, we and all our activities are subject to state environmental and safety regulations established by various departments of the French Government, including the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Ecology and the Ministry of Industry, and to local 16Table of Contents environmental and safety regulations and administrative procedures established by DRIRE (Direction Régionale de lIndustrie, de la Recherche et de lEnvironnement) and the Préfecture des Pyrénées Orientales.  In addition, our shooting operations in Germany and France may be particularly vulnerable to noise abatement regulations because these operations are primarily conducted outdoors. The Dillenburg facility is operated based on a mountain plan (Bergplan), which is a specific permit granted by the local mountain authority. This permit must be renewed every three years. Changes in or compliance with environmental and safety laws and regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require modifications to our facilities. Any actual or alleged violations of environmental and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability under applicable law.  Under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our or our predecessors past or present facilities and at third party waste disposal sites.  We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage.  Accordingly, environmental, health or safety matters may result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities. We are subject to extensive government regulation and failure to comply could subject us to future liabilities and could adversely affect our ability to conduct or to expand our business. We are subject to extensive government regulation in the United States, Germany, France, Canada, Russia and Kazakhstan, including guidelines and regulations for the safe manufacture, handling, transport and storage of explosives issued by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations set forth by the U.S. Department of Transportation; the Safety Library Publications of the Institute of Makers of Explosive; and similar guidelines of their European counterparts.  In Germany, the transport, storage and use of explosives is governed by a permit issued under the Explosives Act (Sprengstoffgesetz).  In France, the manufacture and transportation of explosives is subcontracted to a third party which is responsible for compliance with regulations established by various State and local governmental agencies concerning the handling and transportation of explosives.  Our French operations could be adversely affected if the third party does not comply with these regulations.  We must comply with licensing and regulations for the purchase, transport, storage, manufacture, handling and use of explosives. In addition, while our shooting facilities in Würgendorf and Troisdorf, Germany and Tautavel, France are located outdoors, our shooting facilities located in Pennsylvania and in Dillenburg, Germany are located in mines, which subject us to certain regulations and oversight of governmental agencies that oversee mines. We are also subject to extensive environmental and occupational safety regulation, as described below under Liabilities under environmental and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability and The use of explosives subjects us to additional regulation, and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities. The export of certain products from the United States or from foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies is restricted by U.S. and similar foreign export regulations.  These regulations generally prevent the export of products that could be used by certain end users, such as those in the nuclear or biochemical industries.  In addition, the use and handling of explosives may be subject to increased regulation due to heightened concerns about security and terrorism. Such regulations could restrict our ability to access and use explosives and increase costs associated with the use of such explosives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any failure to comply with current and future regulations in North America and Europe could subject us to future liabilities. In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities, construct new facilities, or compete in certain markets or could require us to incur other significant expenses in order to maintain compliance. Accordingly, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected by our non-compliance with applicable regulations, by any significant limitations on our business as a result of our inability to comply with applicable regulations, or by any requirement that we spend substantial amounts of capital to comply with such regulations. 17Table of Contents Work stoppages and other labor relations matters may make it substantially more difficult or expensive for us to produce our products, which could result in decreased sales or increased costs, either of which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to the risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters, particularly in Germany and France, where some of our employees are unionized. The employees at our U.S. and Canadian facilities, where a significant portion of our products are manufactured, are not unionized. While we believe our relations with employees are satisfactory, any prolonged work stoppage or strike at any one of our principal facilities could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We have not experienced a strike or work stoppage in the last 3 years.  However, if a work stoppage occurs at one or more of our facilities, it may materially impair our ability to operate our business in the future. As we regularly test the value of goodwill associated with our recent acquisitions, economic conditions may lead to an impairment of such goodwill. We review the carrying value of goodwill at least annually to assess impairment because it is not amortized.  Additionally, we review the carrying value of any intangible asset or goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.  Our impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2012 did not result in a determination that any of our goodwill was impaired.  However, future impairment is possible and could occur if (i) the operating results underperform what we have estimated or (ii) additional volatility of the capital markets should cause us to raise the percent discount rate utilized in our discounted cash flow analysis or decrease the multiples utilized in our market-based analysis.  The use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model when determining the fair value of our reporting units or using methodologies other than as described above could result in different values for reporting units and could result in an impairment charge. The unsuccessful integration of a business we acquire could have a material adverse effect on operating results. We continue to consider possible acquisitions as part of our growth strategy. Any potential acquisition may require additional debt or equity financing, resulting in additional leverage and dilution to existing stockholders. We may be unable to consummate any future acquisition.  If any acquisition is made, we may not be able to integrate such acquisition successfully without a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 18Table of Contents "

 Related to the Explosive Metalworking Segment Business has slowed down in some of our markets and we experienced a significant decline in 2009 and 2010 sales. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we began to see a slowdown in DMC Clad sales to some of the markets we serve which continued into 2009 and 2010 and contributed to declines of 31.2% and 26.5% in year-to-year 2009 and 2010 sales, respectively.  DMC Clad experienced a sales recovery in 2011 which led to a 28.0% increase in year-to-year 2011 sales.  Our order backlog, which decreased to $49.6 million at December 31, 2009 from $97.2 million at December 31, 2008, rebounded only modestly to $56.5 million at December 31, 2010 before decreasing to $44.6 million at December 31, 2011.  The explosion-weld cladding market is dependent upon sales of products for use by customers in a limited number of heavy industries, including oil and gas, alternative energy, chemicals and petrochemicals, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation, and industrial refrigeration.  These industries tend to be cyclical in nature and an economic slowdown in one or all of these industrieswhether due to traditional cyclicality, general economic conditions or other factorscould impact capital expenditures within that industry.  If demand from such 11Table of Contents industries were to decline or to experience reduced growth rates, our sales would be expected to be affected proportionately, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our backlog figures may not accurately predict future sales. We define backlog at any given point in time to consist of all firm, unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time.  Generally speaking, we expect to fill most items of backlog within the following 12 months.  However, since orders may be rescheduled or canceled and a significant portion of our net sales is derived from a small number of customers, backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels.  Moreover, we cannot be sure of when during the future 12-month period we will be able to recognize revenue corresponding to our backlog nor can we be certain that revenues corresponding to our backlog will not fall into periods beyond the 12-month horizon. There is a limited availability of sites suitable for cladding operations. Our cladding process involves the detonation of large amounts of explosives. As a result, the sites where we perform cladding must meet certain criteria, including lack of proximity to a densely populated area, the specific geological characteristics of the site, and the ability to comply with local noise and vibration abatement regulations in conducting the process. In addition, our primary U.S. shooting site is subleased under an arrangement pursuant to which we provide certain contractual services to the sub-landlord.  The efforts to identify suitable sites and obtain permits for using the sites from local government agencies can be time-consuming and may not be successful.  In addition, we could experience difficulty in obtaining or renewing permits because of resistance from residents in the vicinity of proposed sites.  The failure to obtain required governmental approvals or permits could limit our ability to expand our cladding business in the future, and the failure to maintain such permits or satisfy other conditions to use the sites would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The use of explosives subjects us to additional regulation, and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities. Our operations involve the detonation of large amounts of explosives.  As a result, we are required to use specific safety precautions under U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration guidelines and guidelines of similar entities in Germany and France.  These include precautions which must be taken to protect employees from exposure to sound and ground vibration or falling debris associated with the detonation of explosives.  There is a risk that an accident or death could occur in one of our facilities.  Any accident could result in significant manufacturing delays, disruption of operations or claims for damages resulting from death or injuries, which could result in decreased sales and increased expenses. To date, we have not incurred any significant delays, disruptions or claims resulting from accidents at our facilities.  The potential liability resulting from any accident or death, to the extent not covered by insurance, may require us to use other funds to satisfy our obligations and could cause our business to suffer.  See Our use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity that could lead to temporary or permanent closure of our shooting sites below. Our use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity that could lead to temporary or permanent closure of our shooting sites. We use a large amount of explosives in connection with the creation of clad metals.  The use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity.  Explosions, even if occurring as intended, can lead to damage to the shooting facility or to equipment used at the facility or injury to persons at the facility. If a person were injured or killed in connection with such explosives, or if equipment at the mine or either of the outdoor locations were damaged or destroyed, we might be required to suspend our operations for a period of time while an investigation is undertaken or repairs are made.  Such a delay might impact our ability to meet the demand for our products.  In addition, if the mine were seriously damaged, we might not be able to locate a suitable replacement site to continue our operations. 12Table of Contents Certain raw materials we use are subject to supply shortages due to general economic conditions. Although we generally use standard metals and other materials in manufacturing our products, certain materials such as specific grades of carbon steel, titanium, zirconium and nickel can be subject to supply shortages due to general economic conditions or problems with individual suppliers.  While we seek to maintain sufficient alternative supply sources for these materials, we may not always be able to obtain sufficient supplies or obtain supplies at acceptable prices without production delays, additional costs, or a loss of product quality.  If we were to fail to obtain sufficient supplies on a timely basis or at acceptable prices, such loss or failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Certain raw materials we use are subject to price increases due to general economic conditions. The markets for certain metals and other raw materials used in our business are highly variable and are characterized by periods of increasing prices.  While prices for much of the raw materials we use have recently decreased, we may again experience increasing prices.  We generally do not hedge commodity prices or enter into forward supply contracts; instead we endeavor to pass along price variations to our customers.  We may see a general downturn in business if the price of raw materials increases enough for our customers to delay planned projects or use alternative materials to complete their projects. Risk Factors
 Related to DYNAenergetics Potential downturns in the oil and gas industry and related services industry could have a negative impact on DYNAenergeticss economic success. The oil and gas industry is unpredictable and has historically been subject to occasional downturns.  Demand for DYNAenergetics products is linked to the financial success of the oil and gas industry as a whole, and downturns in the oil and gas industry, especially in the rate of well drilling, could negatively impact DYNAenergetics economic success.  A variety of factors affect the demand for DYNAenergetics products, including governmental regulation of oil and gas industry and markets, international and domestic prices for oil and gas, weather conditions, the financial condition of DYNAenergetics clients, and consumption patterns of oil and gas. The manufacturing of explosives subjects DYNAenergetics to various environmental, health and safety laws. DYNAenergetics is subject to a number of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in significant penalties.  DYNAenergetics continued success depends on continued compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  In addition, new environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could be passed which could create costly compliance issues.  While DYNAenergetics endeavors to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, compliance with future laws and regulations may not be economically feasible or even possible. DYNAenergetics continued economic success depends on remaining at the forefront of innovation in the perforating industry. DYNAenergetics position in the perforation market depends in part on its ability to remain an innovative leader in the field.  The ability to remain competitive depends in part on the retention of talented personnel.  DYNAenergetics may be unable to remain an innovative leader in the perforation market segment or may be unable to retain top talent in the field. 13Table of Contents Risk Factors
 Related to Dynamic Materials Corporation Weakness in the general global economy may adversely affect certain segments of our end market customers and reduce our sales and results of operations. We supply products to customers that fabricate industrial equipment for various capital-intensive industries.  Weakness in the general global economy may adversely affect our end market customers, causing them to cancel or postpone new plant or infrastructure construction, expansion, maintenance, or retrofitting projects that use our DMC Clad products.  Similarly, any decrease in oil and gas well drilling activities will reduce the sales of our DYNAenergetics products.  Any decrease in the demand for gas turbines and airplane engines will reduce the demand for the work performed by our AMK division.  The global general economic climate may lessen demand for our products and reduce our sales and results of operations. Our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in annual and quarterly operating results caused by various factors, including the timing and size of orders by major customers, customer inventory levels, shifts in product mix, acquisitions and divestitures, and general economic conditions.  The upstream oil and gas, oil refinery, chemical and petrochemical, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation, industrial refrigeration and other diversified industries to which we sell our products are, to varying degrees, cyclical and tend to decline in response to overall declines in industrial production.  As a result, our business is also cyclical, and the demand for our products by these customers depends, in part, on overall levels of industrial production. Any future material weakness in demand in any of these industries could materially reduce our revenues and profitability. In addition, the threat of terrorism and other geopolitical uncertainty could have a negative impact on the global economy, the industries we serve and our operating results. We typically do not obtain long-term volume purchase contracts from our customers. Quarterly sales and operating results, therefore, depend on the volume and timing of the orders in our backlog as well as bookings received during the quarter.  Significant portions of our operating expenses are fixed, and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts and product development programs. If sales do not meet our expectations in any given period, the adverse impact on operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust operating expenses sufficiently or quickly enough to compensate for such a shortfall. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results for any future period. Fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock.  See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We are exposed to potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against the currencies of many of our operating subsidiaries. Many of our operating subsidiaries conduct business in Euros or other foreign currency.  Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of any of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience foreign currency translation losses (gains) with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. In addition, our company and our operating subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we or they enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or their respective functional currencies. For example DYNAenergetics KGs functional currency is Euros, but its sales often occur in U.S. dollars.  Changes in exchange rates with respect to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. In addition, we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to our operating subsidiaries assets and liabilities and to the financial results of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of equity. As a result of foreign currency risk, we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The primary exposure to foreign currency risk for us is to the Euro due to the percentage of our U.S. dollar revenue that is derived from countries where the Euro is the functional currency. 14Table of Contents The terms of our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants, the breach of any of which could result in acceleration of payment of our credit facilities. We are parties to a syndicated credit agreement that, as of December 31, 2011, had an outstanding balance of approximately $26.5 million.  Our credit agreement includes various covenants and restrictions, certain of which relate to the incurrence of additional indebtedness; mortgaging, pledging or disposition of major assets; and limits on capital expenditures and other investments.  We are also required to maintain certain financial ratios on a quarterly basis.  A breach of any of these covenants could result in acceleration of our obligations to repay our debt.  As of December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and other provisions of the credit agreement and our other loan agreements.  However, our ability to comply with these covenants and ratios may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. Any failure to remain in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our credit agreement could result in a default which would, absent a waiver or amendment, require immediate repayment of outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities.  It may be difficult to liquidate assets sufficient to immediately repay our outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility. Customers have the right to change orders until products are completed. Customers have the right to change orders after they have been placed.  If orders are changed, the extra expenses associated with the change will be passed on to the customer.  However, because a change in an order may delay completion of the project, recognition of income for the project may also be delayed. There is no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully against other clad, perforating, and welding companies. Our explosion-welded clad products compete with explosion-welded clad products made by other manufacturers in the clad metal business located throughout the world and with clad products manufactured using other technologies. Our combined North American and European operations typically supply explosion-welded clad to the worldwide market. There is one other well-known explosion-welded clad supplier worldwide, a division of Asahi-Kasei Corporation of Japan. There are also a number of smaller companies worldwide with explosion-welded clad manufacturing capability, including several companies in China.  There are currently no other significant North American based explosion-welded clad suppliers. We focus strongly on reliability, product quality, on-time delivery performance, and low cost manufacturing to minimize the potential of future competitive threats.  However, there is no guarantee we will be able to maintain our competitive position. Explosion-welded clad products also compete with those manufactured by rollbond and weld overlay cladding processes. In rollbond technology, the clad and base metal are bonded together during a hot rolling process in which slab is converted to plate. In weld overlay, which is typically performed by our fabricator customers, the cladding layer is deposited on the base metal through a fusion welding process. The technical and commercial niches of each cladding process are well understood within the industry and vary from one world market location to another.  Our products compete with weld overlay clad products manufactured by a significant number of our fabricator customers. DYNAenergetics competes principally with perforating companies based in North America, South America, and Russia who produce and market perforating services and products.  DYNAenergetics also competes with oil and gas service companies who are able to satisfy a portion of their perforating needs through in-house production.  To remain competitive, DYNAenergetics must continue to provide innovative products and maintain an excellent reputation for quality, safety, and value.  There can be no assurances that we will continue to compete successfully against these companies. AMK Welding competes principally with other domestic companies that provide welding services to the aircraft engine and power generation industries.  Some of these competitors have established positions in the market and long standing relationships with customers. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop and provide technologically advanced welding, heat-treat and inspection services, maintain quality levels, offer flexible delivery schedules, and compete favorably on the basis of price. We compete against other welding companies on the basis of quality, performance and cost. There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully against these companies. 15Table of Contents We are dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our net sales. A significant portion of our net sales is derived from a relatively small number of customers although sales to no one customer exceeded 10% during any of the last three years. We expect to continue to depend upon our principal customers for a significant portion of our sales, although our principal customers may not continue to purchase products and services from us at current levels, if at all. The loss of one or more major customers or a change in their buying patterns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In past years, the majority of DMC Clads revenues have been derived from customers in the oil and gas, alternative energy, chemicals and petrochemicals, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation and industrial refrigeration industries and the majority of AMK Weldings revenues have been derived from customers in the aircraft engine and power generation industries. Economic downturns in these industries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. DYNAenergetics, which contributed approximately 35% to our 2011 sales, has customers throughout the world.  Economic or political instability in certain regions of the world where DYNAenergetics conducts a significant volume of its business, such as Russia, could have a material adverse effect on DYNAenergetics business and operating results. AMK Welding, contributed approximately 5% to our 2011 sales, continues to rely primarily on one customer for the majority of its sales. This customer and AMK Welding have entered into a long-term supply agreement for certain of the services provided to this customer.  Any termination of or significant reduction in AMK Weldings business relationship with this customer could have a material adverse effect on AMK Weldings business and operating results. Failure to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our current operations. Our continued success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical employees. The loss of services of certain of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such individuals on acceptable terms, if at all; and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Liabilities under environmental and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability. We are subject to extensive environmental and safety regulation in North America and Europe. Any failure to comply with current and future environmental and safety regulations could subject us to significant liabilities. In particular, any failure to control the discharge of hazardous materials and wastes could subject us to significant liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. We and all our activities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations, including but not limited to, noise abatement and air emissions regulations, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, regulations issued and laws enforced by the labor and employment departments of the U.S. and the states in which we conduct business, by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and by state and local health and safety agencies.  In Germany, we and all our activities are subject to various safety and environmental regulations of the federal state which are enforced by the local authorities, including the Federal Act on Emission Control (Bundesimmissionsschutzgesetz).  The Federal Act on Emission Control permits are held by companies jointly owned by DYNAenergetics and the other companies that are located at the Würgendorf and Troisdorf manufacturing sites and are for an indefinite period of time.  In France, we and all our activities are subject to state environmental and safety regulations established by various departments of the French Government, including the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Ecology and the Ministry of Industry, and to local environmental and safety regulations and administrative procedures established by DRIRE (Direction Régionale de lIndustrie, de la Recherche et de lEnvironnement) and the Préfecture des Pyrénées Orientales.  In addition, our shooting operations in Germany and France may be particularly vulnerable to noise abatement regulations because these operations are primarily conducted outdoors. The Dillenburg facility is operated based on a mountain plan (Bergplan), which is a specific permit granted by the local mountain authority. This permit must be renewed every three years. 16Table of Contents Changes in or compliance with environmental and safety laws and regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require modifications to our facilities. Any actual or alleged violations of environmental and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability under applicable law.  Under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our or our predecessors past or present facilities and at third party waste disposal sites.  We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage.  Accordingly, environmental, health or safety matters may result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities. We are subject to extensive government regulation and failure to comply could subject us to future liabilities and could adversely affect our ability to conduct or to expand our business. We are subject to extensive government regulation in the United States, Germany, France, Canada and Russia, including guidelines and regulations for the safe manufacture, handling, transport and storage of explosives issued by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations set forth by the U.S. Department of Transportation; the Safety Library Publications of the Institute of Makers of Explosive; and similar guidelines of their European counterparts.  In Germany, the transport, storage and use of explosives is governed by a permit issued under the Explosives Act (Sprengstoffgesetz).  In France, the manufacture and transportation of explosives is subcontracted to a third party which is responsible for compliance with regulations established by various State and local governmental agencies concerning the handling and transportation of explosives.  Our French operations could be adversely affected if the third party does not comply with these regulations.  We must comply with licensing and regulations for the purchase, transport, storage, manufacture, handling and use of explosives. In addition, while our shooting facilities in Würgendorf and Troisdorf, Germany and Tautavel, France are located outdoors, our shooting facilities located in Pennsylvania and in Dillenburg, Germany are located in mines, which subject us to certain regulations and oversight of governmental agencies that oversee mines. We are also subject to extensive environmental and occupational safety regulation, as described below under Liabilities under environmental and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability and The use of explosives subjects us to additional regulation, and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities. The export of certain products from the United States or from foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies is restricted by U.S. and similar foreign export regulations.  These regulations generally prevent the export of products that could be used by certain end users, such as those in the nuclear or biochemical industries.  In addition, the use and handling of explosives may be subject to increased regulation due to heightened concerns about security and terrorism. Such regulations could restrict our ability to access and use explosives and increase costs associated with the use of such explosives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any failure to comply with current and future regulations in North America and Europe could subject us to future liabilities. In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities, construct new facilities, or compete in certain markets or could require us to incur other significant expenses in order to maintain compliance. Accordingly, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected by our non-compliance with applicable regulations, by any significant limitations on our business as a result of our inability to comply with applicable regulations, or by any requirement that we spend substantial amounts of capital to comply with such regulations. Work stoppages and other labor relations matters may make it substantially more difficult or expensive for us to produce our products, which could result in decreased sales or increased costs, either of which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to the risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters, particularly in Germany and France, where some of our employees are unionized. The employees at our U.S. and Canadian facilities, where a significant portion of our products are manufactured, are not unionized. While we believe our relations with employees are satisfactory, any prolonged work stoppage or strike at any one of our principal facilities could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We have not experienced a strike or work stoppage in the last 3 years.  However, if a work stoppage occurs at one or more of our facilities, it may materially impair our ability to operate our business in the future. 17Table of Contents As we regularly test the value of goodwill associated with our recent acquisitions, economic conditions may lead to an impairment of such goodwill. We review the carrying value of goodwill at least annually to assess impairment because it is not amortized.  Additionally, we review the carrying value of any intangible asset or goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.  Our impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2011 did not result in a determination that any of our goodwill was impaired.  However, future impairment is possible and could occur if (i) the operating results underperform what we have estimated or (ii) additional volatility of the capital markets should cause us to raise the percent discount rate utilized in our discounted cash flow analysis or decrease the multiples utilized in our market-based analysis.  The use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model when determining the fair value of our reporting units or using methodologies other than as described above could result in different values for reporting units and could result in an impairment charge. The unsuccessful integration of a business we acquire could have a material adverse effect on operating results. We continue to consider possible acquisitions as part of our growth strategy. Any potential acquisition may require additional debt or equity financing, resulting in additional leverage and dilution to existing stockholders. We may be unable to consummate any future acquisition.  If any acquisition is made, we may not be able to integrate such acquisition successfully without a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 18Table of Contents "

 Risk Factors
 Related to the Explosive Metalworking Segment Business has slowed down in some of our markets and we experienced a significant decline in 2009 and 2010 sales. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we began to see a slowdown in DMC Clad sales to some of the markets we serve which continued into 2009 and 2010 and contributed to declines of 31.2% and 26.5% in our year-to-year 2009 and 2010 sales, respectively.  Our order backlog, which decreased to $49.6 million at December 31, 2009 from $97.2 million at December 31, 2008, rebounded only modestly to $56.5 million at December 31, 2010.  The explosion-weld cladding market is dependent upon sales of products for use by customers in a limited number of heavy industries, including oil and gas, alternative energy, chemicals and petrochemicals, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation, and industrial refrigeration.  These industries tend to be cyclical in nature, and the current worldwide economic downturn has affected many of these markets.  We have already seen a slowdown in the chemical, petrochemical and hydrometallurgy sectors.  A further economic slowdown in one or all of these industrieswhether due to traditional cyclicality, general economic conditions or other factorscould impact capital expenditures within that industry.  If demand from such industries were to decline further or to experience reduced growth rates, our sales would be expected to be affected proportionately, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our backlog figures may not accurately predict future sales. We define backlog at any given point in time to consist of all firm, unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time.  Generally speaking, we expect to fill most items of backlog within the following 12 months.  However, since orders may be rescheduled or canceled and a significant portion of our net sales is derived from a small number of customers, backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels.  Moreover, we cannot be sure of when during the future 12-month period we will be able to recognize revenue corresponding to our backlog; nor can we be certain that revenues corresponding to our backlog will not fall into periods beyond the 12-month horizon. There is a limited availability of sites suitable for cladding operations. Our cladding process involves the detonation of large amounts of explosives.

 Related to Dynamic Materials Corporation Continued weakness in the general global economy may adversely affect certain segments of our end market customers and reduce our sales and results of operations. We supply products to customers that fabricate industrial equipment for various capital-intensive industries.  Continuation of the current weakness in the general global economy may adversely affect our end market customers, causing them to cancel or postpone new plant or infrastructure construction, expansion, maintenance, or retrofitting projects that use our DMC Clad products.  Similarly, decreased oil and gas well drilling will reduce the sales of our DYNAenergetics products.  Any decrease in the demand for gas turbines and airplane engines will reduce the demand for the work performed by our AMK division.  The global general economic climate may lessen demand for our products and reduce our sales and results of operations. Our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in annual and quarterly operating results caused by various factors, including the timing and size of orders by major customers, customer inventory levels, shifts in product mix, acquisitions and divestitures, and general economic conditions.  The upstream oil and gas, oil refinery, chemical and petrochemical, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation, industrial refrigeration and other diversified industries to which we sell our products are, to varying degrees, cyclical and tend to decline in response to overall declines in industrial production.  As a result, our business is also cyclical, and the demand for our products by these customers depends, in part, on overall levels of industrial production. Any future material weakness in demand in any of these industries could materially reduce our revenues and profitability. In addition, the threat of terrorism and other geopolitical uncertainty could have a negative impact on the global economy, the industries we serve and our operating results. We typically do not obtain long-term volume purchase contracts from our customers. Quarterly sales and operating results, therefore, depend on the volume and timing of the orders in our backlog as well as bookings received during the quarter.  Significant portions of our operating expenses are fixed, and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts and product development programs. If sales do not meet our expectations in any given period, the adverse impact on operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust operating expenses sufficiently or quickly enough to compensate for such a shortfall. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results for any future period. Fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock.  See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 14 We are exposed to potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against the currencies of many of our operating subsidiaries. Many of our operating subsidiaries conduct business in Euros or other foreign currency.  Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of any of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience foreign currency translation losses (gains) with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. In addition, our company and our operating subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we or they enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or their respective functional currencies. For example DYNAenergetics KGs functional currency is Euros, but its sales often occur in U.S. dollars.  Changes in exchange rates with respect to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. In addition, we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to our operating subsidiaries assets and liabilities and to the financial results of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of equity. As a result of foreign currency risk, we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The primary exposure to foreign currency risk for us is to the Euro due to the percentage of our U.S. dollar revenue that is derived from countries where the Euro is the functional currency. The terms of our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants, the breach of any of which could result in acceleration of payment of our credit facilities. We are parties to a syndicated credit agreement that, as of December 31, 2010, had an outstanding balance of approximately $23.3 million.  Our credit agreement includes various covenants and restrictions, certain of which relate to the incurrence of additional indebtedness; mortgaging, pledging or disposition of major assets; and limits on capital expenditures and other investments.  We are also required to maintain certain financial ratios on a quarterly basis.  A breach of any of these covenants could result in acceleration of our obligations to repay our debt.  On February 2, 2011, we and our lenders amended the credit agreement to revise the leverage ratios and fixed charge coverage ratios that we are required to satisfy on a quarterly basis throughout the term of the credit facility, which expires on November 16, 2012.  These revised ratios eased the Companys ability to comply with certain covenants of the credit agreement.  As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and other provisions of the credit agreement and our other loan agreements.  However, our ability to comply with these covenants and ratios may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. Any failure to remain in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our credit agreement could result in a default which would, absent a waiver or amendment, require immediate repayment of outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities.  It may be difficult to liquidate assets sufficient to immediately repay our outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility. Customers have the right to change orders until products are completed. Customers have the right to change orders after they have been placed.  If orders are changed, the extra expenses associated with the change will be passed on to the customer.  However, because a change in an order may delay completion of the project, recognition of income for the project may also be delayed. There is no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully against other clad, perforating, and welding companies. Our explosion-welded clad products compete with explosion-welded clad products made by other manufacturers in the clad metal business located throughout the world and with clad products manufactured using other technologies. Our combined North American and European operations typically supply explosion-welded clad to the worldwide market. There is one other well-known explosion-welded clad supplier worldwide, a division of Asahi-Kasei Corporation of Japan. There are also a number of smaller companies worldwide with explosion-welded clad manufacturing capability, including several companies in China.  There are currently no other significant North American based explosion-welded clad suppliers. We focus strongly on reliability, product quality, on-time delivery performance, and low cost 15 manufacturing to minimize the potential of future competitive threats.  However, there is no guarantee we will be able to maintain our competitive position. Explosion-welded clad products also compete with those manufactured by rollbond and weld overlay cladding processes. In rollbond technology, the clad and base metal are bonded together during a hot rolling process in which slab is converted to plate. In weld overlay, which is typically performed by our fabricator customers, the cladding layer is deposited on the base metal through a fusion welding process. The technical and commercial niches of each cladding process are well understood within the industry and vary from one world market location to another.  Our products compete with weld overlay clad products manufactured by a significant number of our fabricator customers. DYNAenergetics competes principally with perforating companies based in North America, South America, and Russia who produce and market perforating services and products.  DYNAenergetics also competes with oil and gas service companies who are able to satisfy a portion of their perforating needs through in-house production.  To remain competitive, DYNAenergetics must continue to provide innovative products and maintain an excellent reputation for quality, safety, and value.  There can be no assurances that we will continue to compete successfully against these companies. AMK Welding competes principally with other domestic companies that provide welding services to the aircraft engine and power generation industries.  Some of these competitors have established positions in the market and long standing relationships with customers. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop and provide technologically advanced welding, heat-treat and inspection services, maintain quality levels, offer flexible delivery schedules, and compete favorably on the basis of price. We compete against other welding companies on the basis of quality, performance and cost. There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully against these companies. We are dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our net sales. A significant portion of our net sales is derived from a relatively small number of customers although sales to no one customer exceeded 10% during any of the last three years. We expect to continue to depend upon our principal customers for a significant portion of our sales, although our principal customers may not continue to purchase products and services from us at current levels, if at all. The loss of one or more major customers or a change in their buying patterns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In past years, the majority of DMC Clads revenues have been derived from customers in the oil and gas, alternative energy, chemicals and petrochemicals, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation and industrial refrigeration industries and the majority of AMK Weldings revenues have been derived from customers in the aircraft engine and power generation industries. Economic downturns in these industries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. DYNAenergetics, which contributed approximately 29% to our 2010 sales, has customers throughout the world.    Economic or political instability in certain regions of the world where DYNAenergetics conducts a significant volume of its business, such as Russia, could have a material adverse affect on DYNAenergetics business and operating results. AMK Welding, contributed approximately 7% to our 2010 sales, continues to rely primarily on one customer for the majority of its sales. This customer and AMK Welding have entered into a long-term supply agreement for certain of the services provided to this customer.  Any termination of or significant reduction in AMK Weldings business relationship with this customer could have a material adverse effect on AMK Weldings business and operating results. Failure to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our current operations. Our continued success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical employees. The loss of services of certain of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such individuals on acceptable terms, if at all; and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 16 Liabilities under environmental and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability. We are subject to extensive environmental and safety regulation in North America and Europe. Any failure to comply with current and future environmental and safety regulations could subject us to significant liabilities. In particular, any failure to control the discharge of hazardous materials and wastes could subject us to significant liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. We and all our activities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations, including but not limited to, noise abatement and air emissions regulations, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, regulations issued and laws enforced by the labor and employment departments of the U.S. and the states in which we conduct business, by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and by state and local health and safety agencies.  In Germany, we and all our activities are subject to various safety and environmental regulations of the federal state which are enforced by the local authorities, including the Federal Act on Emission Control (Bundesimmissionsschutzgesetz).  The Federal Act on Emission Control permits are held by companies jointly owned by DYNAenergetics and the other companies that are located at the Würgendorf and Troisdorf manufacturing sites and are for an indefinite period of time.  In France, we and all our activities are subject to state environmental and safety regulations established by various departments of the French Government, including the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Ecology and the Ministry of Industry, and to local environmental and safety regulations and administrative procedures established by DRIRE (Direction Régionale de lIndustrie, de la Recherche et de lEnvironnement) and the Préfecture des Pyrénées Orientales.  In Sweden, we and all our activities are subject to various safety and environmental regulations, including those established by the Work Environment Authority of Sweden in its Work Environment Act.  In addition, our shooting operations in Germany, France and Sweden may be particularly vulnerable to noise abatement regulations because these operations are primarily conducted outdoors. The Dillenburg facility is operated based on a mountain plan (Bergplan), which is a specific permit granted by the local mountain authority. This permit must be renewed every three years. Changes in or compliance with environmental and safety laws and regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require modifications to our facilities. Any actual or alleged violations of environmental and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability under applicable law.  Under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our or our predecessors past or present facilities and at third party waste disposal sites.  We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage.  Accordingly, environmental, health or safety matters may result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities. We are subject to extensive government regulation and failure to comply could subject us to future liabilities and could adversely affect our ability to conduct or to expand our business. We are subject to extensive government regulation in the United States, Germany, France, Canada, Russia and Sweden, including guidelines and regulations for the safe manufacture, handling, transport and storage of explosives issued by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations set forth by the U.S. Department of Transportation; the Safety Library Publications of the Institute of Makers of Explosive; and similar guidelines of their European counterparts.  In Germany, the transport, storage and use of explosives is governed by a permit issued under the Explosives Act (Sprengstoffgesetz).  In Sweden, our purchase, transport, storage and use of explosives is governed by a permit issued to us by the Police Authority of the County of Varmland.  In France, the manufacture and transportation of explosives is subcontracted to a third party which is responsible for compliance with regulations established by various State and local governmental agencies concerning the handling and transportation of explosives.  Our French operations could be adversely affected if the third party does not comply with these regulations.  We must comply with licensing and regulations for the purchase, transport, storage, manufacture, handling and use of explosives. In addition, while our shooting facilities in Würgendorf and Troisdorf, Germany, France and Sweden are located outdoors, our shooting facilities located in Pennsylvania and in Dillenburg, Germany are located in mines, which subjects us to certain regulations and oversight of governmental agencies that oversee mines. 17  We are also subject to extensive environmental and occupational safety regulation, as described below under Liabilities under environmental and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability and The use of explosives subjects us to additional regulation, and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities. The export of certain products from the United States or from foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies is restricted by U.S. and similar foreign export regulations.  These regulations generally prevent the export of products that could be used by certain end users, such as those in the nuclear or biochemical industries.  In addition, the use and handling of explosives may be subject to increased regulation due to heightened concerns about security and terrorism. Such regulations could restrict our ability to access and use explosives and increase costs associated with the use of such explosives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any failure to comply with current and future regulations in North America and Europe could subject us to future liabilities. In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities, construct new facilities, or compete in certain markets or could require us to incur other significant expenses in order to maintain compliance. Accordingly, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected by our non-compliance with applicable regulations, by any significant limitations on our business as a result of our inability to comply with applicable regulations, or by any requirement that we spend substantial amounts of capital to comply with such regulations. Work stoppages and other labor relations matters may make it substantially more difficult or expensive for us to produce our products, which could result in decreased sales or increased costs, either of which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to the risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters, particularly in Germany, France, and Sweden, where some of our employees are unionized. The employees at our U.S. facilities, where the majority of products are manufactured, and Canadian facilities are not unionized. While we believe our relations with employees are satisfactory, any prolonged work stoppage or strike at any one of our principal facilities could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We have not experienced a strike or work stoppage in the last 3 years.  However, if a work stoppage occurs at one or more of our facilities, it may materially impair our ability to operate our business in the future. As we regularly test the value of goodwill associated with our recent acquisitions, economic conditions may lead to an impairment of such goodwill. We review the carrying value of goodwill at least annually to assess impairment because it is not amortized.  Additionally, we review the carrying value of any intangible asset or goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.  Our impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2010 did not result in a determination that any of our goodwill was impaired.  However, future impairment is possible and could occur if (i) the operating results underperform what we have estimated or (ii) additional volatility of the capital markets should cause us to raise the percent discount rate utilized in our discounted cash flow analysis or decrease the multiples utilized in our market-based analysis.  The use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model when determining the fair value of our reporting units or using methodologies other than as described above could result in different values for reporting units and could result in an impairment charge. The unsuccessful integration of a business we acquire could have a material adverse effect on operating results. We continue to consider possible acquisitions as part of our growth strategy. Any potential acquisition may require additional debt or equity financing, resulting in additional leverage and dilution to existing stockholders. We may be unable to consummate any future acquisition.  If any acquisition is made, we may not be able to integrate such acquisition successfully without a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 18 "

 Related toOur IndustryDespite substantial growth in recent yearsin our existing markets, growth in such markets may not continue at the samerate indefinitely.From 2004 to 2005 and from2005 to 2006, sales by DMC Clad increased by 47% and 43%, respectively.  However, the explosion-weld cladding marketis dependent upon sales of products for use by customers in a limited number ofheavy industries, including upstream oil and gas, oil refinery, petrochemicals,hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation andindustrial refrigeration.  Theseindustries tend to be cyclical in nature, and there can be no assurance thatthe construction and other needs of those industries for our products willcontinue to grow at current rates.  Aneconomic slowdown in one or all of these industries, whether due to cyclicalityor other factors, could impact capital expenditures within the industry.  If demand from such industries were todecline or even grow less quickly, our sales would be expected to be affectedproportionately, which may have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition and results of operations.There is a limited availability of sitessuitable for cladding operations.Our cladding processinvolves the detonation of large amounts of explosives. As a result, the siteswhere we perform cladding must meet certain criteria, including lack ofproximity to a densely populated area, the specific geological characteristicsof the site, and the ability to comply with local noise and vibration abatementregulations in conducting the process. The process of identifying suitablesites and obtaining permits for using the sites from local government agenciescan be time-consuming and may not be successful.  In addition, we could experience difficultyin obtaining or renewing permits because of resistance from residents in thevicinity of proposed sites.  The failureto obtain required governmental approvals or permits could limit our ability toexpand our cladding business in the future, and the failure to maintain suchpermits would have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition and results of operations.Certain raw materials we use are subject tosupply shortages due to general economic conditions.Although we generally usestandard metals and other materials in manufacturing our products, certainmaterials such as specific grades of carbon steel, titanium, zirconium andnickel can be subject to supply shortages due to general economic conditions orproblems with individual suppliers. While we seek to maintain sufficient alternative supply sources forthese materials, there can be no assurance that we will always be able toobtain sufficient supplies or obtain supplies at acceptable prices withoutproduction delays, additional costs or a loss of product quality.  If we were to fail to obtain sufficientsupplies on a timely basis or at acceptable prices, such loss or failure couldhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and resultsof operations.Certain raw materials we use are subject toprice increases due to general economic conditions.The markets for certainmetals and other raw materials used in our business are highly variable and arecharacterized by periods of increasing prices. We generally do not hedge commodity prices or enter into forward supplycontracts, and instead we endeavor to pass along price variations to ourcustomers.  We may see a general downturnin business if the price of raw materials increases enough for our customers todelay planned projects or use alternative materials to complete their projects.11 We are subject to extensive governmentregulation and failure to comply could subject us to future liabilities andcould adversely affect our ability to conduct or to expand our business.We are subject to extensivegovernment regulation in the United States, France and Sweden, includingguidelines and regulations for the safe manufacture, handling, transport andstorage of explosives provided by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco andFirearms, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations set forth by the U.S.Department of Transportation and the Safety Library Publications of theInstitute of Makers of Explosive and similar guidelines of their Europeancounterparts.  In Sweden, the purchase,transport, storage and use of explosives is governed by a permit issued by thePolice Authority of the County of Varmland. (In France, the manufacture and transportation of explosives issubcontracted to Nobel Explosifs France, an affiliate of SNPE, which isresponsible for compliance with regulations established by various State andlocal governmental agencies concerning the handling and transportation ofexplosives.)  We must comply withlicensing and regulations for the purchase, transport, storage, manufacture,handling and use of explosives.

To date, we have not incurred any significant delays, disruptions orclaims resulting from accidents at our facilities.  The potential liability resulting from anyaccident or death, to the extent not covered by insurance, may require us touse other funds to satisfy our obligations and could cause our business tosuffer.  See   Our use of explosives isan inherently dangerous activity that could lead to temporary or permanentclosure of our shooting sites below.Our use of explosives is an inherently dangerousactivity that could lead to temporary or permanent closure of our shootingsites.We use a large amount ofexplosives in connection with the creation of clad metals and the shocksynthesis of diamonds.  The use ofexplosives is an inherently dangerous activity. Explosions, even if occurring as intended, can lead to damage to theshooting facility or to equipment used at the facility or injury to persons atthe facility. If a person were injured or killed in connection with suchexplosives, or if equipment at the mine or either of the outdoor locations weredamaged or destroyed, we might be required to suspend our operations for aperiod of time while an investigation is undertaken or repairs are made.  Such a delay might impact our ability to meetthe demand for our products.  Inaddition, if the mine were seriously damaged, we might not be able to locate asuitable replacement site to continue our operations.Risk Factors
 Related to Dynamic Materials CorporationOur operating results fluctuate from quarterto quarter.We have experienced, andexpect to continue to experience, fluctuations in annual and quarterlyoperating results caused by various factors, including the timing and size oforders by major customers, customer inventory levels, shifts in product mix,acquisitions and divestitures, and general economic conditions.  Theupstream oil and gas, oil refinery, chemical and petrochemical,hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation,industrial refrigeration and other diversified industries to which we sell ourproducts are, to varying degrees, cyclical and tend to decline in response tooverall declines in industrial production. As a result, our business is also cyclical, and the demand for ourproducts by these customers depends, in part, on overall levels of industrialproduction. Any future material weakness in demand in any of these industriescould materially reduce our revenues and profitability. In addition, the threatof terrorism and other geopolitical uncertainty could have a negative impact onthe global economy, the industries we serve and our operating results.13 We typically do not obtainlong-term volume purchase contracts from our customers. Quarterly sales andoperating results, therefore, depend on the volume and timing of backlogs aswell as bookings received during the quarter. Significant portions of our operating expenses are fixed, and plannedexpenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts and product developmentprograms. If sales do not meet our expectations in any given period, theadverse impact on operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjustoperating expenses sufficiently or quickly enough to compensate for such ashortfall. Results of operations in any period should not be consideredindicative of the results to be expected for any future period. Fluctuations inoperating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of our commonstock.  See Managements Discussion andAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Customers have the right to change ordersuntil products are completed.Customers have the right tochange orders after they have been placed. If orders are changed, the extra expenses associated with the changewill be passed on to the customer. However, because a change in an order may delay completion of theproject, recognition of income for the project may also be delayed.There is no assurance that we will continueto compete successfully against other clad and welding companies.Our explosion-welded cladproducts compete with explosion-welded clad products made by othermanufacturers in the clad metal business located throughout the world and withclad products manufactured using other technologies.

Inweld overlay, which is typically performed by our fabricator customers, thecladding layer is deposited on the base metal through a fusion welding process.The technical and commercial niches of each cladding process are wellunderstood within the industry and vary from one world market location toanother.  Our products compete with weldoverlay clad products manufactured by a significant number of our fabricatorcustomers.AMK Welding competesprincipally with other domestic companies that provide welding services to theaircraft engine and power generation industries.  Some of these competitors have establishedpositions in the market and long standing relationships with customers. Toremain competitive, we must continue to develop and provide technologicallyadvanced welding, heat-treat and inspection services, maintain quality levels,offer flexible delivery schedules, and compete favorably on the basis of price.We compete against other welding companies on the basis of quality, performanceand cost. There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfullyagainst these companies.We are dependent on a relatively smallnumber of customers for a significant portion of our net sales.A significant portion of ournet sales is derived from a relatively small number of customers although salesto no one customer exceeded 10% during the last three years. We expect tocontinue to depend upon our principal customers for a significant portion ofour sales, although there can be no assurance that our principal customers willcontinue to purchase products and services from us at current levels, if atall. The loss of one or more major customers or a change in their buyingpatterns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition and results of operations. In past years, the majority of DMC Cladsrevenues have been derived from customers in the upstream oil and gas, oilrefinery, petrochemicals, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding,power generation and industrial refrigeration industries and the majority ofAMK Weldings revenues have been derived from customers in the aircraft engineand 14 powergeneration industries. Economic downturns in these industries could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results ofoperations.AMK Welding, which contributesapproximately 5% to our total sales, continues to rely primarily on onecustomer for the majority of its sales. This customer and AMK Welding haveentered into a long-term supply agreement for certain of the services providedto this customer.  Any termination of orsignificant reduction in AMK Weldings business relationship with this customercould have a material adverse effect on AMK Weldings business and financialcondition.Failure to attract and retain key personnelcould adversely affect our current operations.Our continued successdepends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial andtechnical employees. The loss of services of certain of these key personnelcould have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations andfinancial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attractand retain such individuals on acceptable terms, if at all, and the failure todo so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditionand results of operations.Work stoppages and other labor relationsmatters may make it substantially more difficult or expensive for us to produceour products, which could result in decreased sales or increased costs, eitherof which would negatively impact our financial condition and results ofoperations.We are subject to the riskof work stoppages and other labor relations matters, particularly in France andSweden, where some of our employees are unionized. The employees at our U.S.facility, where the majority of products are manufactured, are not unionized.While we believe our relations with employees are satisfactory, any prolongedwork stoppage or strike at any one of our principal facilities could have anegative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.We most recently experienced a one-week work stoppage in 2005 at our facilityin France. This strike did not materially impact operations, but we cannotassure you that a work stoppage at one or more of our facilities will notmaterially impair our ability to operate our business in the future.The unsuccessful integration of a businesswe acquire could have a material adverse effect on operating results.We continue to considerpossible acquisitions as part of our growth strategy. Any potential acquisitionmay require additional debt or equity financing, resulting in additionalleverage and dilution to existing stockholders. We cannot assure you that anyfuture acquisition will be consummated, or that if consummated that we will beable to integrate such acquisition successfully without a material adverseeffect on our financial condition or results of operations.15"
