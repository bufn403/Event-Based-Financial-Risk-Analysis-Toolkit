5,CVV,CVD EQUIPMENT CORP,2023-03-27,"          Risk Factors
  In addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our shareholders should carefully consider the risk factors described below. The risks set forth below may not be the only risk factors relating to the Company. Any of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and stock price. Risk categories: ●Risks related to sales and product development ●Risks related to manufacturing and supply chain ●Risks related to cybersecurity, intellectual property and regulatory compliance ●Risks related to financial and accounting matters ●Risks related to product liability ●Risks related to our stock ●General risk factors 17  Risks related to sales and product development Historically, we have maintained a highly concentrated customer base so that changes in ordering patterns, delays or order cancellations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  During 2022, one customer accounted for 29.2% of our total revenues. The loss of a major customer would have to be replaced by others, and our inability to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We expect that contracts or orders from a relatively limited number of customers will, at times, continue to account for a substantial portion of our business. The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. If any major customer did not place orders, or if they substantially reduced, delayed, or cancelled orders, we may not be able to replace the business in a timely manner or at all, which can and has had a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Major customers may also seek, and on occasion receive, pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to us and can hurt our competitive position. Our lengthy and variable sales cycle makes it difficult to predict our financial results. The marketing, sale and manufacture of our products, often requires a lengthy sales cycle ranging from several months to over one year before we can complete production and delivery. The lengthy sales cycle makes forecasting the volume and timing of sales difficult and raises additional risks that customers may cancel or decide not to enter into contracts. The length of the sales cycle depends on the size and complexity of the project, the customer’s in-depth evaluation of our products, and, in some cases, the protracted nature of a bidding process. Because a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed, we have and may continue to incur substantial expense before we earn associated revenue. If customer cancellations occur, they could result in the loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our operating expenses. If any of our customers cancel or fail to accept a large system order, our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our backlog includes of orders customized systems including our chemical vapor deposition equipment and annealing and diffusion furnaces which are built to client specifications. These customized systems can have prices up to several million dollars, depending on the configuration, specific options included and any specific requirements of the customer. Because our orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer, our backlog at any point in time is not necessarily representative of actual sales for succeeding periods, nor does our backlog provide any assurance of achievement of revenues or that we will realize a profit from completing these orders. Our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected should any large system order be cancelled prior to shipment, or not be accepted by the customer due to alleged non-conformity with product specifications or otherwise. Likewise, a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of our customers that purchase large systems, could have a material impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results. Our backlog does not provide any assurance that we will realize a profit from those orders or indicate in which period revenue will be recognized. 18  If demand declines for chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor transport, gas control and related equipment, or for carbon nanotube and nanowire deposition systems, our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our products are utilized to develop and manufacture materials and coatings for industrial and research applications that are used in numerous markets including but not limited to power electronics, battery materials, aerospace, nano and advanced electronic components. A significant part of our growth strategy involves continued expansion of the sales of our products for industrial as well as research and development purposes by companies, universities, and government-funded research laboratories. The availability of funds for these purposes may be subject to budgetary and political restrictions, as well as cost-cutting measures by manufacturers in the markets in which we operate. If the availability of funds or the demand for capital equipment in the markets in which we operate declines, the demand for our products would also decline and our financial position and results of operations could be harmed. The demand for our products and the profitability of our products can change significantly from period to period because of numerous factors. The industries in which we operate are characterized by ongoing factors, including:  ●global and regional economic developments and conditions including in Europe and Asia; ●governmental budgetary and political constraints; ●changes in the capacity utilization and production volume for research and industrial applications in the markets in which we operate; ●the profitability and capital resources of manufacturers in the markets in which we operate; changes in technology; ●the availability of funds for research and development; ●the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic; and ●the effects of supply chain disruptions. For these and other reasons, our results of operations for past periods may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results. Our business might be adversely affected by our dependence on foreign business. Because a portion of our revenues are derived from international customers, our operating results could be negatively affected by a decline in the economies of any of the countries or regions in which we do business. Each region can exhibit unique characteristics, which can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period.  Periodic local or international economic downturns, trade balance issues and political instability, as well as fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates, could negatively affect our business and results of operations. The majority of our sales to date have been primarily priced in U.S. dollars. While our business has not been materially affected in the past by currency fluctuations, there is a risk that it may be materially adversely affected in the future. Such risks include possible losses due to both currency exchange rate fluctuations and from possible social and political instability.  19  Our reputation and operating performance may be negatively affected if our products are not timely delivered. We provide complex products that often require substantial lead-time for design, ordering parts and materials, and for assembly and installation. The time required to design, order parts and materials and to manufacture, assemble and install our products, may in turn lead to delays or shortages in the availability of some products. If a product is delayed or is the subject of shortage because of problems with our ability to design, manufacture or assemble the product on a timely basis, obtain necessary materials and components, or if a product or software otherwise fails to meet performance criteria, we may lose revenue opportunities entirely, or experience delays in revenue recognition associated with a product or service. In addition, we may incur higher operating expenses during the period required to correct the problem. We may not be able to keep pace with the rapid change in the technology we use in our products. We believe that our continued success in the markets in which we operate depends, in part, on our ability to continually improve existing technologies and to develop and manufacture new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. We must be able to introduce these products and product enhancements into the market in a timely manner, in response to customer’s demands for higher-performance research and assembly equipment, customized to address rapid technological advances in capital equipment designs. Technological innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing. Our future business success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products, or new uses for existing products, that successfully address changing customer needs. Our success also depends on our ability to achieve market acceptance of our new products. To maintain our success in the marketplace, we may have to substantially increase our expenditures on research and development. If we do not develop and introduce new products, technologies or uses for existing products in a timely manner and continually find ways to reduce the cost of developing and producing them in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, our business could be seriously harmed. We face significant competition, and we are relatively small in size and have fewer resources in comparison with many of our competitors. We face significant competition throughout the world, which may increase as certain markets in which we operate continue to evolve. Our future performance depends, in part, upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide. Some of our competitors are diversified companies that have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive research, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we can provide. We face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products, some of which compete with the products and services that we offer, as well as companies, universities and research laboratories that have the capacity to design and build their own equipment internally. These competitors may bundle their products and services in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products. In addition, we face competition from smaller emerging processing equipment companies, whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer at often lower prices than ours, using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets. Loss of competitive position could impair our prices, customer orders, revenue, gross margin, and market share, any of which would negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. Our failure to compete successfully with these other companies would seriously harm our business. There is a risk that larger, better financed competitors will develop and market more advanced products than those we currently offer, or that competitors with greater financial resources may decrease prices, thereby putting us under financial pressure. 20  Risks related to manufacturing and our supply chain Manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect our ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs, while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory. Our business depends on timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of our customers. Some key parts to our products are subject to long lead-times and/or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers. Cyclical industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for us and for companies throughout our supply chain. Further, these conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations. We have also experienced and continue to experience significant disruptions in our supply chain, resulting in delays and higher costs to procure certain components and materials that we utilize in our business. We may also experience significant interruptions of our manufacturing operations, delays in our ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:  ●The failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis; ●Volatility in the availability and cost of materials, including rare earth elements; ●Difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals; ●Information technology or infrastructure failures; ●Natural disasters or other events beyond our control (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war); and ●The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees, suppliers and other third-parties upon which we rely. If a supplier fails to meet our requirements concerning quality, cost, or other performance factors, we may transfer our business to alternative sources, which could entail manufacturing delays, additional costs, or other difficulties. In addition, if we need to rapidly increase our business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may exacerbate any interruptions in our manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on our working capital. 21  We are presently experiencing supply chain delays and cost increases that may adversely affect our business. The COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted worldwide supply chains and our ability to obtain component parts. Subsequent geopolitical developments across Europe and Asia have and may continue to restrict our ability to procure raw materials and components such as nickel and integrated circuits. Furthermore, disruptions and delays in the ability of our third-party freight carriers to transport these items to our manufacturing facility also continues to be a challenge. In 2022, we experienced increased costs on certain components as well as delays in supply chain delivery, which may also impact our ability to recognize revenue and reduce our gross profit margins, as well as extend our manufacturing lead times and reduce our manufacturing efficiencies. We have begun placing orders with more lead time to help mitigate the manufacturing delays, as well as assessing other suppliers or components to attempt to mitigate the potential cost impacts. In addition, we are utilizing our in-house flexible manufacturing to attempt to further mitigate both potential schedule delivery delays and material cost increase, as well as increasing sales prices. While we have initiated actions to mitigate the potential negative impacts to our revenue and profitability, there can be no assurance of the ultimate impact and the length of time that the supply chain factors may impact our revenues and profitability. Inflation has and may continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Recent global inflation has adversely affected our costs, including the cost of materials, production, and labor. As such, we have had to implement measures to mitigate the negative impacts of inflation on our costs. As the selling prices in our customer contracts are fixed, any increase in the cost of materials, labor and other costs as we manufacture any system would negatively impact our gross margins and results of operations. Longstanding or increased periods of inflation could perpetuate these material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If our critical suppliers fail to deliver enough quality materials and components in a timely and cost-effective manner, it could negatively affect our business. We do not manufacture many components used in the production of our products, and consequently, we use numerous unrelated suppliers of materials and components.  Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical developments across Europe and Asia, we are experiencing reduced availability of raw materials and components. In turn, any reduction in the availability of these materials and components may reduce our ability to obtain sufficient amounts in a cost-effective manner. We generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers. Because of the variability and uniqueness of our customer’s orders, we try to avoid maintaining an extensive inventory of materials and components for manufacturing. While we are not dependent on any principal or major supplier for most of our material and component needs, switching to an alternative supplier may take significant amounts of time and added expense, which could result in a disruption of our operations and adversely affect our business. It is not always practical or even possible to ensure that component parts are available from multiple suppliers; accordingly, we procure some key parts from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. At certain times, increases in demand for capital equipment can result in longer lead-times for many important system components, which may cause delays in meeting shipments to our customers. The delay in the shipment of even a few systems could cause significant variations in our quarterly revenue, operating results and the market value of our common stock.  22  Our manufacturing facilities are in Central Islip, New York, Saugerties, New York and Nordborg, Denmark and could be affected due to multiple weather risks, including risks to our Central Islip facility from hurricanes and similar phenomena. Our manufacturing facilities are located in Central Islip, New York, Saugerties, New York and Nordborg, Denmark and could be affected by multiple weather risks, most notably hurricanes for our Central Islip facility which located on Long Island, New York. Although we carry property and casualty insurance and business interruption insurance, future possible disruptions of operations or damage to property, plant and equipment due to hurricanes or other weather risks could result in impaired production and affect our ability to meet our commitments to our customers and impair important business relationships, the loss of which could adversely affect our operations and profitability. We do, however, maintain a backup power source at our Central Islip facility, are working to establish deeper redundancies between our New York facilities to help mitigate this risk. Risks related to cybersecurity, intellectual property and regulatory compliance If we are subject to cyberattacks, we could incur substantial costs and, if such attacks are successful, we could incur significant liabilities, reputational harm, and disruption to our operations. We manage, store, and transmit proprietary information and sensitive data relating to our operations. We may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use for these purposes. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate and/or compromise our confidential information (and or third-party confidential information), create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or our products, or that otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. While we have an active security training program for all employees during the year, utilize intrusion prevention and detection systems, as well as hardware firewall and virus security, the costs to address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers, impeding our sales, manufacturing, distribution, or other critical functions. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive data about us, our customer, or other third parties, could expose us, our customers, or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business. 23  Our financial position and results of operations may be materially harmed if we are unable to recoup our investment in research and development. The rapid change in technology in our industry requires that we continue to make substantial investments in research and development and selective acquisitions of technologies and products, to enhance the performance and functionality of our product line, to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands for improved performance, features and functionality.  There can be no assurance that revenue from future products or enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products, enhancements, or acquisitions, or that we will be able to secure the financial resources necessary to fund future research and development or acquisitions. Research and development costs are typically incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a product, and not all development activities result in commercially viable products. In addition, we cannot ensure that products or enhancements will receive market acceptance, or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us.  Our business could be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices, or if our products are not accepted by the markets in which we operate. We have made investments in our proprietary technologies. If third parties violate our proprietary rights, or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietary rights, such events could result in a loss of value of some of our intellectual property or costly litigation. We attempt to protect certain of our intellectual property rights by obtaining patent and trademark protection where we believe it is appropriate to do so. While patent, copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property may be important, we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel.  We may also attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees, and consultants, and through other internal security measures. However, these employees, consultants and third parties may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing. In addition, the laws of certain territories in which we sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Occasionally, we may receive communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights or other intellectual property rights that they believe cover certain of our products, processes, technologies, or information. In addition, it is possible we could have a dispute with a customer concerning the use of intellectual property utilized in their equipment.  If such cases arise, we will evaluate our position and consider the available alternatives, which may include seeking licenses to use the technology in question on commercially reasonable terms, developing new alternative technology or defending our position. Nevertheless, we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain licenses, or, if we are able to obtain licenses, which related terms will be acceptable, or that litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur. Defending our intellectual property rights through litigation could be very costly. If we are not able to negotiate the necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or successfully defend our position, our ability to utilize such intellectual property could substantially inhibit our access to certain markets and our ability to compete in these markets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. 24  We may be unable to obtain required export licenses for the sale of our products. Whether with respect to sales to customers located in China or otherwise, products which (i) are manufactured in the United States, (ii) incorporate controlled U.S. origin parts, technology, or software, or (iii) are based on U.S. technology, are subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) when exported to and re-exported from international jurisdictions, in addition to the local jurisdiction’s export regulations applicable to individual shipments. Licenses or proper license exceptions may be required for the shipment of our products to certain customers or countries. Obtaining an export license or determining whether an export license exception exists often requires considerable effort by us and cooperation from the customer, which can add time to the order fulfillment process. We may be unable to obtain required export licenses or qualify for export license exceptions and, as a result, we may be unable to export products to our customers and/or meet their servicing needs. Non-compliance with the EAR or other applicable export regulations could result in a wide range of penalties including the denial of export privileges, fines, criminal penalties, and the seizure of commodities. If an export regulatory body determines that any of our shipments violate applicable export regulations, we could be fined significant sums and our export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Failure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have agreements with third parties and make sales in countries known to experience corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft, and other fraudulent practices. We can make no assurance, however, that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We are subject to environmental regulations, and our inability or failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business. We are subject to environmental regulations in connection with our business operations, including regulations related to the development and manufacture of our products and our customers’ use of our products. Our failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental regulations could result in significant remediation liabilities, the imposition of fines or the suspension or termination of development, manufacturing, or use of certain of our products, or affect the operation of our facilities, use or value of our real property, each of which could damage our financial position and results of operations. 25  Regulations related to conflict minerals will force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chains more complex, and may result in damage to our relationships with customers. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted requirements for companies that manufacture products that contain certain minerals and metals known as “conflict minerals”. These rules require public companies to perform diligence and to report annually to the SEC whether such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of minerals we use in the manufacture of our products. In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products. Given the complexity of our supply chain, we may not be able to ascertain the origins of these minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as conflict mineral free, which could harm our relationships with these customers and lead to a loss of revenue. These requirements could limit the pool of suppliers that can provide conflict-free minerals, and we may be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at competitive prices, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability. Risks related to financial and accounting matters We might require additional financing. Our continuing operating losses may make it difficult for us to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If adequate financing is not available when required on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, our business and operations may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we could issue additional common stock, to fund our growth initiatives and operations which could materially dilute the ownership interests of the then existing shareholders. We may, in the future, identify deficiencies in controls over financial reporting. While we have concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure and reporting controls were effective as included in Part II, Item 9A, there can be no assurance that material weaknesses will not be identified in the future. If we do identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting in the future, our ability to analyze, record and report financial information free of material misstatements, and to prepare our financial statements within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the SEC, may likely be adversely affected. 26  We have and may continue to be required to take impairment charges on assets. We are required to assess our long-lived assets, including acquired intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, for recoverability and impairment whenever there are indicators or impairment, such as an adverse change in business climate. As part of our long-term strategy, we have pursued acquisitions of other companies or assets, and may pursue future acquisitions of other companies or assets which could potentially increase our assets. Adverse changes in business conditions could materially impact our estimates of future operations and result in impairment charges to these assets. If our assets were impaired, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Acquisitions can result in an increase in our operating costs, divert management’s attention away from other operational matters and expose us to other associated risks. We evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses and technologies, and we consider targeted acquisitions that expand our core competencies to be an important part of our future growth strategy. In the past, we have made acquisitions of other businesses with synergistic products, services and technologies, and plan to continue to do so in the future.  Acquisitions involve numerous risks, which include but are not limited to:  ●difficulties and increased costs in connection with the integration of the personnel, operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies into our existing facilities and operations; ●diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters; ●failure to commercialize the acquired technology; ●the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies; ●lack of synergy, or inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisitions; ●the risk that the issuance of our common stock, if any, in an acquisition or merger could be dilutive to our shareholders; ●the inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies and ●the acquired assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired assets. Cyclical demand for our products may make it difficult for us to accurately budget our expense levels, which are based in part on our projections of future revenues. Historically, demand for our equipment and related consumable products have been volatile because of changes in supply and demand, and other factors in the manufacturing process. Our orders tend to be more volatile than our revenue, as any change in demand is reflected immediately in orders booked, which are net of cancellations, while revenue, tends to be recognized over multiple quarters because of procurement and production lead times, and the deferral of certain revenue under our revenue recognition policies. The fiscal period in which we can recognize revenue is also at times subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment. This could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate. 27  When cyclical fluctuations result in lower-than-expected revenue levels, operating results have been and may continue to be materially adversely affected and cost reduction measures have been and may continue to be necessary for us to remain competitive and financially sound. During a down cycle, we must be able to make timely adjustments to our cost and expense structure to correspond to the prevailing market conditions. In addition, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and the number of our personnel to meet customer demand, which may require additional liquidity. We can provide no assurance, that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to changes within the industry cycles in which we operate. If we fail to respond to these cyclical changes, our business could be seriously harmed. We do not have long-term volume production contracts with our customers, and we do not control the timing or volume of orders placed by our customers. Whether and to what extent our customers place orders for any specific products, and the mix and quantities of products included in those orders are factors beyond our control. Insufficient orders would result in under-utilization of our manufacturing facilities and infrastructure and will negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. Risks related to product liability We face the risk of product liability claims.  The manufacture and sale of our products, which in operation sometimes involve the use of toxic materials and extreme temperatures and could result in product liability claims.  For example, our rapid thermal processing systems used to heat semiconductor materials to temperatures more than 1000º Celsius have certain inherent risks. A failure of our products at a customer site could also result in losses due to interruption of the business operations of our customer. While we regularly evaluate the nature and limits of our insurance coverages, there can be no assurance that our existing policies of insurance will be adequate to protect us from all liabilities that we might incur in connection with the manufacture and sale of our products in the event of a successful product liability claim or series of successful claims against us. The health and environmental effects of nanotechnology are unknown, and this uncertainty could adversely affect the expansion of our business. The health and environmental effects of nanotechnology are unknown. There is no scientific agreement on the health effects of nanomaterials in general and carbon nanotubes but some scientists believe that in some cases, nanomaterials may be hazardous to an individual’s health or to the environment. The science of nanotechnology is based on arranging atoms in such a way as to modify or build materials not made in nature; therefore, the effects are unknown. Future research into the effects of nanomaterials in general, and carbon nanotubes, on health and environmental issues, may have an adverse effect on products incorporating nanotechnology. Since part of our growth strategy is based on sales of research equipment to produce carbon nanotubes and the sale of such materials, the determination that these materials are harmful could adversely affect the expansion of our business. 28  Risk related to our stock The price of our common shares is volatile and could decline significantly. The stock market in general and the market for technology stocks has experienced volatility. If those industry-based market fluctuations continue, the trading price of our common shares could decline significantly independent of the overall market, and shareholders could lose all or a substantial part of their investment. The market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors, including, among others:  ●difficult macroeconomic conditions, unfavorable geopolitical events, and general stock market uncertainties, such as those occasioned by a global liquidity crisis and a failure of large financial institutions; ●an offering of our common shares to raise capital; ●receipt of large orders or cancellations of orders for our products; ●issues associated with the performance and reliability of our products; ●actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations; ●announcements of financial developments or technological innovations; ●changes in recommendations and/or financial estimates by investment research analysis; ●strategic transactions, such as acquisitions, divestitures, or spin-offs; ●offerings of our securities; ●the occurrence of major catastrophic events; and ●volatile trading volumes. Significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to our publicly traded securities and those of technology companies generally. The price of our common shares is likely to be volatile in the future. In the past, securities class action litigation often has been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. If similar litigation were pursued against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. General risks Our success is highly dependent on the technical, sales, marketing and managerial contributions of key individuals, including our Chief Executive Officer and President, and we may be unable to retain these individuals or recruit others. We depend on our senior executives including our Chief Executive Officer and President, and certain key managers as well as, engineering, research and development, sales, marketing and manufacturing personnel, who are critical to our business. Except for our Chief Executive Officer and President, we do not have employment agreements with our key employees. Furthermore, the current labor market remains very competitive and challenging for the acquisition and retention of key employees. Larger competitors may be able to offer more generous compensation packages to our executives and key employees, and therefore we risk losing key personnel to those competitors. If we were to lose the services of any of our key personnel, our engineering, product development, manufacturing and sales efforts could be slowed. We may also incur increased operating expenses and be required to divert the attention of our senior executives to search for their replacements. The integration of any new personnel could disrupt our ongoing operations. 29  We may not be able to hire or retain the number of qualified personnel, particularly engineering personnel, required for our business, which would harm the development and sales of our products and limit our ability to grow.  Competition in our industry for senior management, technical, sales, marketing and other key personnel is intense and has been made even more challenging in the current labor market. If we are unable to retain our existing personnel, or attract and train additional qualified personnel, our growth may be limited due to a lack of capacity to develop and market our products. We have, from time to time, had trouble in hiring and retaining skilled engineers with appropriate qualifications to support our growth strategy. Our success depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified engineering personnel with experience in equipment design. Specifically, we need to continue to attract and retain mechanical, electrical, software and field service engineers to work with our direct sales force to technically qualify and perform on new sales opportunities and orders, and to demonstrate our products. A pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease such as COVID-19 in the United States or worldwide has adversely affected our business. Although we expect conditions relating to COVID-19 will continue to improve, the COVID-19 pandemic has had and if conditions deteriorate again, could continue to have an adverse effect on the United States and global economies, as well as on aspects of our business, operations, and financial condition and those of third parties on whom we rely. We previously experienced some decreases in product demand in certain of our other businesses. If conditions related to the pandemic were to deteriorate, we expect that parts of our business could again suffer negative impacts from the pandemic.  On the supply side, we are experiencing continued but moderating challenges with the supply of raw materials and components used in the production of our products. There are currently industry wide supply shortages of certain raw materials and electronic components. We have experienced raw material cost increases because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which will likely continue. In addition, while logistics capacity constraints are improving, we continue to experience freight surcharges and expect these to continue at least for the near term.  With respect to our personnel, although we adhere to government mandated and Environmental, Health and Safety protocols, an outbreak of COVID-19 at one or more of our facilities could cause shutdowns of facilities and a reduction in our workforce, which could dramatically affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown, and it is difficult to predict the full extent of potential impacts the pandemic could have in the future on our business, operations, and financial results, or on our customers, suppliers, logistics providers, or on the global economy. 30  "
9,CVV,CVD EQUIPMENT CORP,2022-03-31,"Risk Factors
   In addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our shareholders should carefully consider the risk factors described below. The risks set forth below may not be the only risk factors relating to the Company. Any of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and stock price. We are presently experiencing Supply chain delays and cost increases that may adversely affect our business. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted worldwide supply chains and the ability to obtain sufficient amounts of component parts. In addition, geopolitical developments across Europe and Asia have and may continue to restrict our ability to procure raw materials and components such as nickel and integrated circuits. Furthermore, disruptions and delays in the ability of our third party freight carriers to transport these items to our manufacturing facility also continues to be a challenge. During the third and fourth quarters of 2021, and into 2022, we experienced increased costs on certain components as well as delays in supply chain delivery, which may also impact our ability to recognize revenue and reduce our gross profit margins, as well as extend our manufacturing lead times and reduce our manufacturing efficiencies. We have commenced placing orders with more lead time to help mitigate the manufacturing delays, as well as assessing other suppliers or components to attempt to mitigate the potential cost impacts. In addition, we are utilizing our in-house flexible manufacturing to attempt to further mitigate both potential schedule delivery delays and material cost increase, as well as increasing sales prices. While we have initiated actions to mitigate the potential negative impacts to our revenue and profitability, there can be no assurance of the ultimate impact and the length of time period that the supply chain factors may impact our revenues and profitability. A pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease such as COVID-19 in the United States or worldwide has adversely affected our business. Our operations expose us to risks associated with pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies, such as the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which has spread from China to the rest of the world.  Outbreaks such as these have resulted, and can continue to result, in governments around the world implementing increasingly stringent measures to help control the spread, including quarantines, ""shelter in place"" and ""stay at home"" orders, travel restrictions, business curtailments, school closures, and other measures.  These actions with respect to the COVID-19 outbreak have negatively impacted, and could continue to have negative impacts on, our operations, supply chain, transportation networks, customers and employees.  The COVID-19 outbreak has materially and adversely affected, and any continuing economic downturn as a result of this pandemic could continue to adversely affect, demand for our products, and negatively impact our business or results of operations through the temporary closure of our operating locations or those of our customers or suppliers. In particular, the aerospace sector, for which we rely on a significant part of our business, has been faced with significant reductions to its business due to lack of air travel.        14                   Since the end of our first quarter 2020, we have experienced the impacts of COVID-19 on our markets and operations which have included significant decreases in demand, supply chain disruptions, and logistics constraints.  Given government mandates and concerns over employee safety, some of our production facilities were closed or significantly slowed production during the end of the first quarter 2020 and into the second quarter 2020.  The extent to which COVID-19 has and may continue to adversely impact our business depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including new information concerning the severity of the outbreak and the effectiveness of actions globally to contain or mitigate its effects.  While we expect this situation to continue to materially and adversely impact our financial results, the current level of uncertainty over the economic and operational impacts of COVID-19 means the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Inflation has and may continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations Recent inflation has adversely affected our costs, including the cost of materials, production, and labor. As such, we have had to implement measures to mitigate the negative impacts of inflation on our costs. Longstanding or increased periods of inflation could perpetuate these material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be unable to obtain required export licenses for the sale of our products. Whether with respect to sales to customers located in China or otherwise, products which (i) are manufactured in the United States, (ii) incorporate controlled U.S. origin parts, technology, or software, or (iii) are based on U.S. technology, are subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) when exported to and re-exported from international jurisdictions, in addition to the local jurisdiction’s export regulations applicable to individual shipments. Licenses or proper license exceptions may be required for the shipment of our products to certain customers or countries. Obtaining an export license or determining whether an export license exception exists often requires considerable effort by us and cooperation from the customer, which can add time to the order fulfillment process. We may be unable to obtain required export licenses or qualify for export license exceptions and, as a result, we may be unable to export products to our customers and/or meet their servicing needs. Non-compliance with the EAR or other applicable export regulations could result in a wide range of penalties including the denial of export privileges, fines, criminal penalties, and the seizure of commodities. In the event that an export regulatory body determines that any of our shipments violate applicable export regulations, we could be fined significant sums and our export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. We might require additional financing. Our continuing operating losses and decline in revenues may make it difficult for us to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If adequate financing is not available if and when required on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, our business and operations may be materially and adversely affected. In addition we could issue additional common stock, to fund our growth initiatives and operations which could materially dilute the ownership interests of the then existing shareholders.        15                   We have made investments in our proprietary technologies. If third parties violate our proprietary rights, or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietary rights, such events could result in a loss of value of some of our intellectual property or costly litigation. We attempt to protect certain of our intellectual property rights by obtaining patent andtrademark protection where we believe it is appropriate to do so. While patent, copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property may be important, we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel.  We may also attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through other internal security measures.  However, these employees, consultants and third parties may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing.  In addition, the laws of certain territories in which we sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Occasionally, we may receive communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights or other intellectual property rights that they believe cover certain of our products, processes, technologies or information. In addition, it is possible we could have a dispute with a customer concerning the use of intellectual property utilized in their equipment.  If such cases arise, we will evaluate our position and consider the available alternatives, which may include seeking licenses to use the technology in question on commercially reasonable terms, developing new alternative technology or defending our position.  Nevertheless, we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain licenses, or, if we are able to obtain licenses, that related terms will be acceptable, or that litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur.  Defending our intellectual property rights through litigation could be very costly.  If we are not able to negotiate the necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or successfully defend our position, our ability to utilize such intellectual property could substantially inhibit our access to certain markets and our ability to compete in these markets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Historically, we have maintained a highly concentrated customer base so that changes in ordering patterns, delays or order cancellations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  While in 2021 no customers account for greater than 10% of our annual revenues, the loss of a major customer would have to be replaced by others, and our inability to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We expect that contracts or orders from a relatively limited number of customers will, at times, continue to account for a substantial portion of our business. The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. If any major customer did not place orders, or substantially reduced, delayed or cancelled orders, we may not be able to replace the business in a timely manner or at all, which can and has had a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Major customers may also seek, and on occasion receive, pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to us and can hurt our competitive position.        16                   Our lengthy and variable sales cycle makes it difficult to predict our financial results. The marketing, sale and manufacture of our products, often requires a lengthy sales cycle ranging from several months to over one year before we can complete production and delivery. The lengthy sales cycle makes forecasting the volume and timing of sales difficult, and raises additional risks that customers may cancel or decide not to enter into contracts. The length of the sales cycle depends on the size and complexity of the project, the customer’s in-depth evaluation of our products, and, in some cases, the protracted nature of a bidding process. Because a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed, we have and may continue to incur substantial expense before we earn associated revenue. If customer cancellations occur, they could result in the loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our operating expenses. We have and may continue to be required to take additional impairment charges on assets. We are required to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment, or on an interim basis, whenever certain events occur or circumstances change, such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount. We are also required to test our long-lived assets, including acquired intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, for recoverability and impairment whenever there are indicators or impairment, such as an adverse change in business climate. As part of our long-term strategy, we have pursued acquisitions of other companies or assets, such as our acquisitions of assets owned by Tantaline ApS and MesoScribe Technologies, Inc. and may pursue future acquisitions of other companies or assets which could potentially increase our assets. Adverse changes in business conditions could materially impact our estimates of future operations and result in impairment charges to these assets. If our assets were impaired, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In January 2021, we began an intensive analysis of our entire business and operations including the Materials Business. Based upon that analysis we believed our primary focus should be on the core equipment business and that the Materials Business strategy should be revised, with some of its current elements potentially minimized or ceased.  Based upon that analysis, we forecasted continued losses and negative cash flow for our Tantaline product line and as a consequence, we have implemented plans to eliminate further investment in our Tantaline product line. This resulted in a discontinuation of all US Tantaline operations, including the halting of substantial capital investments, and the consolidation of all Tantaline operating activities into the Denmark Tantaline facility. In addition, we recorded an impairment charge of $3.6 million in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2020.        17                   Our success is highly dependent on the technical, sales, marketing and managerial contributions of key individuals, including our Chief Executive Officer and President, and we may be unable to retain these individuals or recruit others. We depend on our senior executives including our Chief Executive Officer and President, and certain key managers as well as, engineering, research and development, sales, marketing and manufacturing personnel, who are critical to our business. With the exception of our Chief Executive Officer and President, and our Chief Financial Officer, we do not have employment agreements with our key employees. Furthermore, the current labor market remains very competitive and challenging for the acquisition and retention of key employees. Larger competitors may be able to offer more generous compensation packages to our executives and key employees, and therefore we risk losing key personnel to those competitors. If we were to lose the services of any of our key personnel, our engineering, product development, manufacturing and sales efforts could be slowed. We may also incur increased operating expenses, and be required to divert the attention of our senior executives to search for their replacements. The integration of any new personnel could disrupt our ongoing operations. Acquisitions can result in an increase in our operating costs, divert management’s attention away from other operational matters and expose us to other associated risks. We continually evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses and technologies, and we consider targeted acquisitions that expand our core competencies to be an important part of our future growth strategy.  In the past, we have made acquisitions of other businesses with synergistic products, services and technologies, and plan to continue to do so in the future.  Acquisitions involve numerous risks, which include but are not limited to:   ●  difficulties and increased costs in connection with the integration of the personnel, operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies into our existing facilities and operations;   ●  diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters;   ●  failure to commercialize the acquired technology;   ●  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies;   ●  lack of synergy, or inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisitions;   ●  the risk that the issuance of our common stock, if any, in an acquisition or merger could be dilutive to our shareholders;   ●  the inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies and   ●  the acquired assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired assets.         18                   If demand declines for chemical vapor deposition, gas control and related equipment, or for carbon nanotube and nanowire deposition systems, our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our products are utilized to develop and manufacture materials and coatings for industrial and research applications that are used in numerous markets including but not limited to aerospace, medical, solar, nano and advanced electronic components. A significant part of our growth strategy involves continued expansion of the sales of our products for industrial as well as research and development purposes by companies, universities and government-funded research laboratories. The availability of funds for these purposes may be subject to budgetary and political restrictions, as well as cost-cutting measures by manufacturers in the markets in which we operate. If the availability of funds or the demand for capital equipment in the markets in which we operate declines, the demand for our products would also decline and our financial position and results of operations could be harmed. The conditions of the markets in which we operate are volatile. The demand for our products and the profitability of our products can change significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors. The industries in which we operate are characterized by ongoing changes, including:   ●  the availability of funds for research and development;   ●  global and regional economic conditions;   ●  governmental budgetary and political constraints;   ●  changes in the capacity utilization and production volume for research and industrial applications in the markets in which we operate;   ●  the profitability and capital resources of manufacturers in the markets in which we operate; changes in technology;   ●  The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic; and   ●  Geopolitical developments across Europe and Asia  For these and other reasons, our results of operations for past periods may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results. Volatile and cyclical demand for our products may make it difficult for us to accurately budget our expense levels, which are based in part on our projections of future revenues. Historically, demand for our equipment and related consumable products have been volatile as a result of sudden changes in supply and demand, and other factors in the manufacturing process. Our orders tend to be more volatile than our revenue, as any change in demand is reflected immediately in orders booked, which are net of cancellations, while revenue, tends to be recognized over multiple quarters as a result of procurement and production lead times, and the deferral of certain revenue under our revenue recognition policies. The fiscal period in which we are able to recognize revenue is also at times subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment. This could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate.        19                   When cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results have been and may continue to be materially adversely affected and cost reduction measures have been and may continue to be necessary for us to remain competitive and financially sound. During a down cycle, we must be able to make timely adjustments to our cost and expense structure to correspond to the prevailing market conditions. In addition, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and the number of our personnel to meet customer demand, which may require additional liquidity. We can provide no assurance, that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to changes within the industry cycles in which we operate. If we fail to respond to these cyclical changes, our business could be seriously harmed. In 2019, 2020 and 2021, we reported operating losses of, ($4,985,000), ($7,824,000) and ($4,807,000), respectively. We do not have long-term volume production contracts with our customers, and we do not control the timing or volume of orders placed by our customers. Whether and to what extent our customers place orders for any specific products, and the mix and quantities of products included in those orders are factors beyond our control. Insufficient orders would result in under-utilization of our manufacturing facilities and infrastructure, and will negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. We face significant competition and we are relatively small in size and have fewer resources in comparison with many of our competitors. We face significant competition throughout the world, which may increase as certain markets in which we operate continue to evolve. Our future performance depends, in part, upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide. Some of our competitors are diversified companies that have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive research, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we can provide. We face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products, some of which compete with the products and services that we offer, as well as companies, universities and research laboratories that have the capacity to design and build their own equipment internally. These competitors may bundle their products and services in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products. In addition, we face competition from smaller emerging processing equipment companies, whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer at often lower prices than ours, using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets. Loss of competitive position could impair our prices, customer orders, revenue, gross margin and market share, any of which would negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. Our failure to compete successfully with these other companies would seriously harm our business. There is a risk that larger, better financed competitors will develop and market more advanced products than those we currently offer, or that competitors with greater financial resources may decrease prices, thereby putting us under financial pressure.        20                   The health and environmental effects of nanotechnology are unknown, and this uncertainty could adversely affect the expansion of our business. The health and environmental effects of nanotechnology are unknown. There is no scientific agreement on the health effects of nanomaterials in general and carbon nanotubes, in particular, but some scientists believe that in some cases, nanomaterials may be hazardous to an individual’s health or to the environment. The science of nanotechnology is based on arranging atoms in such a way as to modify or build materials not made in nature; therefore, the effects are unknown. Future research into the effects of nanomaterials in general, and carbon nanotubes in particular, on health and environmental issues, may have an adverse effect on products incorporating nanotechnology. Since part of our growth strategy is based on sales of research equipment for the production of carbon nanotubes and the sale of such materials, the determination that these materials are harmful could adversely affect the expansion of our business. We are presently experiencing increased pricing pressure from reduced funding and increased competition. Our historical business strategy for many of our products has focused on product performance and customer service rather than on price. As a result of budgetary constraints, many of our customers are extremely price sensitive when purchasing capital equipment. If we are unable to obtain prices that allow us to continue to compete on the basis of product performance and customer service, our profit margins will be reduced. We may not be able to keep pace with the rapid change in the technology we use in our products. We believe that our continued success in the markets in which we operate depends, in part, on our ability to continually improve existing technologies and to develop and manufacture new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. We must be able to introduce these products and product enhancements into the market in a timely manner, in response to customer’s demands for higher-performance research and assembly equipment, customized to address rapid technological advances in capital equipment designs. Technological innovations are inherently complex, and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing. Our future business success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products, or new uses for existing products, that successfully address changing customer needs. Our success also depends on our ability to achieve market acceptance of our new products. In order to maintain our success in the marketplace, we may have to substantially increase our expenditures on research and development. If we do not develop and introduce new products, technologies or uses for existing products in a timely manner and continually find ways to reduce the cost of developing and producing them in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, our business could be seriously harmed.        21                   Manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect our ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs, while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory. Our business depends on timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of our customers. Some key parts to our products are subject to long lead-times and/or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers. Cyclical industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for us and for companies throughout our supply chain. Further, these conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations. We have also experienced and continue to experience significantdisruptions in our supply chain, resulting in delays and higher costs to procure certaincomponents and materials that we utilize in our business. We may also experience significant interruptions of our manufacturing operations, delays in our ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:   ●  The failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;   ●  Volatility in the availability and cost of materials, including rare earth elements;   ●  Difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;   ●  Information technology or infrastructure failures; and   ●  Natural disasters or other events beyond our control (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war).   ●  The effects of COVID-19 on our employees, suppliers and other third-parties upon which we rely.  For example, we may source certain materials used in the development and manufacture of our products from regions affected by the COVID-19, which could make access to our supply chain difficult and could affect our business. If a supplier fails to meet our requirements concerning quality, cost, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, we may transfer our business to alternative sources, which could entail manufacturing delays, additional costs, or other difficulties. In addition, if we need to rapidly increase our business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may exacerbate any interruptions in our manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on our working capital.        22                   If any of our customers cancel or fail to accept a large system order, our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our backlog, consists of orders for customized systems including our chemical vapor deposition equipment and annealing and diffusion furnaces which are built to client specifications. We also have a significant concentration of revenue with customers exceeding 10% of revenues. There were no customers in fiscal year 2021 that exceeded 10% of our revenues, while two customers represented 30.5% of our annual revenues in fiscal year 2020. These customized systems can have prices that range from $200,000 to several million dollars, depending on the configuration, specific options included and any special requirements of the customer.  Because our orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer, our backlog at any particular point in time is not necessarily representative of actual sales for succeeding periods, nor does our backlog provide any assurance of achievement of revenues or that we will realize a profit from completing these orders.  Our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected should any large system order be cancelled prior to shipment, or not be accepted by the customer due to alleged non-conformity with product specifications or otherwise. Likewise, a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of our customers that purchase large systems, could have a material impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results.  Our backlog does not provide any assurance that we will realize a profit from those orders, or indicate in which period revenue will be recognized. We may not be able to hire or retain the number of qualified personnel, particularly engineering personnel, required for our business, which would harm the development and sales of our products and limit our ability to grow.  Competition in our industry for senior management, technical, sales, marketing and other key personnel is intense and has been made even more challenging in the current labor market. If we are unable to retain our existing personnel, or attract and train additional qualified personnel, our growth may be limited due to a lack of capacity to develop and market our products. In particular, we have, from time to time, experienced difficulty in hiring and retaining skilled engineers with appropriate qualifications to support our growth strategy. In addition, the “Great Resignation” has resulted in a high level of mobility of employees in many industries which makes it more difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified personnel. Our success depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified engineering personnel with experience in equipment design. Specifically, we need to continue to attract and retain mechanical, electrical, software and field service engineers to work with our direct sales force to technically qualify and perform on new sales opportunities and orders, and to demonstrate our products. Our financial position and results of operations may be materially harmed if we are unable to recoup our investment in research and development. The rapid change in technology in our industry requires that we continue to make substantial investments in research and development and selective acquisitions of technologies and products, in order to enhance the performance and functionality of our product line, to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands for improved performance, features and functionality.  These efforts include those related to the development of technology for the commercialization of carbon nanotubes. There can be no assurance that revenue from future products or enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products, enhancements or acquisitions, or that we will be able to secure the financial resources necessary to fund future research and development or acquisitions.  Research and development costs are typically incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a product, and not all development activities result in commercially viable products.  In addition, we cannot ensure that products or enhancements will receive market acceptance, or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us.  Our business could be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices, or if our products are not accepted by the markets in which we operate.        23                   Our reputation and operating performance may be negatively affected if our products are not  timely delivered. We provide complex products that often require substantial lead-time for design, ordering parts and materials, and for assembly and installation. The time required to design, order parts and materials and to manufacture, assemble and install our products, may in turn lead to delays or shortages in the availability of some products. If a product is delayed or is the subject of shortage because of problems with our ability to design, manufacture or assemble the product on a timely basis, obtain necessary materials and components, or if a product or software otherwise fails to meet performance criteria, we may lose revenue opportunities entirely, or experience delays in revenue recognition associated with a product or service. In addition, we may incur higher operating expenses during the period required to correct the problem. Our business might be adversely affected by our dependence on foreign business. During the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately $4.3 million or 26.0% of our revenues were generated by sales to customers outside the U.S. compared to approximately $2.8 million or 16.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Because a portion of our revenues are derived from international customers, our operating results could be negatively affected by a decline in the economies of any of the countries or regions in which we do business.  Each region can exhibit unique characteristics, which can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period.  Periodic local or international economic downturns, trade balance issues and political instability, as well as fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates, could negatively affect our business and results of operations. All of our sales to date have been primarily priced in U.S. dollars. While our business has not been materially affected in the past by currency fluctuations, there is a risk that it may be materially adversely affected in the future.  Such risks include possible losses due to both currency exchange rate fluctuations and from possible social and political instability.  If our critical suppliers fail to deliver sufficient quantities of quality materials and components in a timely and cost-effective manner, it could negatively affect our business. We do not manufacture many components used in the production of our products, and consequently, we use numerous unrelated suppliers of materials and components.  Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical developments across Europe and Asia, we are experiencing reduced quantities of raw materials and components. In turn, any reduction in the availability of these materials and components may reduce our ability to obtain sufficient amounts in a cost-effective manner. We generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers.  Because of the variability and uniqueness of our customer’s orders, we try to avoid maintaining an extensive inventory of materials and components for manufacturing. While we are not dependent on any principal or major supplier for most of our material and component needs, switching over to an alternative supplier may take significant amounts of time and added expense, which could result in a disruption of our operations and adversely affect our business.        24                   It is not always practical or even possible to ensure that component parts are available from multiple suppliers; accordingly, we procure some key parts from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers.  At certain times, increases in demand for capital equipment can result in longer lead-times for many important system components, which may cause delays in meeting shipments to our customers.  The delay in the shipment of even a few systems could cause significant variations in our quarterly revenue, operating results and the market value of our common stock.  We cannot assure you that our financial position and results of operations will not be materially and adversely affected if, in the future, we do not receive in a timely and cost-effective manner a sufficient quantity of quality component parts and materials to meet our production requirements. The price of our common shares is volatile and could decline significantly. The stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular has experienced volatility. If those industry-based market fluctuations continue, the trading price of our common shares could decline significantly independent of the overall market, and shareholders could lose all or a substantial part of their investment. The market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors, including, among others:   ●  difficult macroeconomic conditions, unfavorable geopolitical events, and general stock market uncertainties, such as those occasioned by a global liquidity crisis and a failure of large financial institutions;   ●  receipt of large orders or cancellations of orders for our products;   ●  issues associated with the performance and reliability of our products;   ●  actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations;   ●  announcements of financial developments or technological innovations;   ●  changes in recommendations and/or financial estimates by investment research analysis;   ●  strategic transactions, such as acquisitions, divestitures, or spin-offs;   ●  offerings of our securities;   ●  the occurrence of major catastrophic events, including the effects of the spread of COVID-19; and   ●  low trading volume  Significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to our publicly traded securities and those of technology companies generally. The price of our common shares is likely to be volatile in the future. In the past, securities class action litigation often has been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. If similar litigation were pursued against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.        25                   We face the risk of product liability claims.  The manufacture and sale of our products, which in operation sometimes involve the use of toxic materials and extreme temperatures, and could result in product liability claims.  For example, our rapid thermal processing systems used to heat semiconductor materials to temperatures in excess of 1000º Celsius have certain inherent risks.  A failure of our product(s) at a customer site could also result in losses due to interruption of the business operations of our customer. While we regularly evaluate the nature and limits of our insurance coverages, there can be no assurance that our existing policies of insurance will be adequate to protect us from all liabilities that we might incur in connection with the manufacture and sale of our products in the event of a successful product liability claim or series of successful claims against us. We are subject to environmental regulations, and our inability or failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business. We are subject to environmental regulations in connection with our business operations, including regulations related to the development and manufacture of our products and our customers’ use of our products. Our failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental regulations could result in significant remediation liabilities, the imposition of fines or the suspension or termination of development, manufacturing or use of certain of our products, or affect the operation of our facilities, use or value of our real property, each of which could damage our financial position and results of operations. If we are subject to cyber-attacks we could incur substantial costs and, if such attacks are successful, we could incur significant liabilities, reputational harm, and disruption to our operations. We manage, store and transmit proprietary information and sensitive data relating to our operations. We may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use for these purposes. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate and/or compromise our confidential information (and or third-party confidential information), create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or our products, or that otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. While we have an active security training program for all employees during the year, utilize intrusion prevention and detection systems, as well as hardware firewall and virus security, the costs to address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers, impeding our sales, manufacturing, distribution, or other critical functions. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive data about us, our customer, or other third parties, could expose us, our customers, or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business.        26                   Regulations related to conflict minerals will force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chains more complex, and may result in damage to our relationships with customers. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted requirements for companies that manufacture products that contain certain minerals and metals known as “conflict minerals”. These rules require public companies to perform diligence and to report annually to the SEC whether such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of minerals we use in the manufacture of our products. In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products. Given the complexity of our supply chain, we may not be able to ascertain the origins of these minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as conflict mineral free, which could harm our relationships with these customers and lead to a loss of revenue. These requirements could limit the pool of suppliers that can provide conflict-free minerals, and we may be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at competitive prices, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability. Failure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have agreements with third parties and make sales in countries known to experience corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices. We can make no assurance, however, that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. "
0,CVV,CVD EQUIPMENT CORP,2021-03-31,"         Risk Factors
  In addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our shareholders should carefully consider the risk factors described below. The risks set forth below may not be the only risk factors relating to the Company. Any of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and stock price. We have significant investments in our CVD Materials segment, which could be met with further delays and ongoing losses that could further materially and adversely impact our financial results and cash flow. In 2017, to support the expected growth of our CVD Materials segment and to house the US based business, on November 30, 2017, we purchased the 555 Building located at 555 North Research Place, Central Islip, NY (the “Premises”). The purchase price of the building was $13,850,000, exclusive of closing costs. We have monthly principal and interest payments of $62,481 and have invested $1.6 million, $2.7 million and $2.5 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, in building improvements, machinery, and other expenses related primarily to CVD Materials. Since September 2019, MesoScribe™ has secured orders of in excess of $2 million, and in early 2020 we have hired four employees including test and project management to support those orders and growth opportunities. Tantaline® US equipment continued to be installed in 2020 and are in various stages of process testing and refinement. The projected growth of the Materials Business has not met expectations. Although we have made substantial investments in facilities, equipment and acquisitions in furtherance of our strategy, the foregoing has proven to be a significant drain on our finances and our liquidity. Since 2018 revenues for the Materials Business have been $1,700,000 in 2018, $1,600,000 in 2019 and $2,300,000 in 2020, with operating losses recorded in all years for a total loss of $2.5 million, exclusive of a $3.6 million impairment charge. These cumulative results are due to operating losses from the Tantaline operations offset by operating profits of $.5 million from the MesoScribe operations. In January 2021, our Board of Directors concluded that we needed a change in direction and new leadership to evaluate our business strategy and operations, and take timely actions to halt and reverse the declines of the past few years. As such, they appointed Emmanuel Lakios as President and Chief Executive Officer (previously our Vice-President- Sales and Marketing). We began an intensive analysis of our entire business and operations including the Materials Business. Based upon that analysis we believe our primary focus should be on the core equipment business and that the Materials Business strategy should be revised, with some of its current elements potentially minimized or ceased.  Based upon this analysis, we are forecasting continued losses and negative cash flow for our Tantaline product line and as a consequence, we have implemented plans to eliminate further investment in our Tantaline product line, which will result in the avoidance of approximately $1.5-$2.0 million in additional costs. In addition, we have recorded an impairment charge of $3.6 million in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2020. Based upon certain decisions and actions currently being reviewed, there may be additional costs to be incurred, inclusive of employee related and lease termination costs estimated at approximately $400,000. 16  In order to increase our liquidity and to provide necessary working capital to support our on-going business and operations, we have decided to sell the 555 Building. We have determined the 555 Building is not needed for present and future business operations. We have concluded that any remaining elements of the Materials Business can be consolidated into the 355 Building, which we believe can accommodate any needs for our growth for the foreseeable future. We might require additional financing. Our overall revenues have declined from $41.1 million in 2017 to $16.9 million in 2020. Cumulative operating losses for the last three years (2018-2020) totaled ($18.1 million), which are comprised of 2018 ($5.3 million), 2019 ($5.0 million) and 2020 ($7.8 million). As a result of these continuing losses, and the investments in the Materials Business, our cash balances have declined from $21.7 million at December 31, 2016 to $7.7 million as of December 31, 2020, and liquidity has been strained. Contributing to and compounding this decline, is the negative effect the COVID-19 crisis has had in 2020 on the aerospace industry, which resulted from reduced travel and reduction of industry gas turbine engine sales. Aerospace sales have represented as much as 60% of our total revenue. Our mortgage debt on the 355 Building and 555 Building, in the amount of $2.1 million and $9.3 million respectively, at December 31 2020, matures in March and December 2022, respectively. In January 2021, our Board of Directors concluded that we needed a change in direction and new leadership to evaluate our business strategy and operations, and take timely actions to halt and reverse the declines of the past few years. As such, they appointed Emmanuel Lakios as President and Chief Executive Officer (previously our Vice-President- Sales and Marketing). We began an intensive analysis of our entire business and operations including the Materials Business. Based upon that analysis we believe our primary focus should be on the core equipment business and that the Materials Business strategy should be revised, with some of its current elements potentially minimized or ceased.  Based upon this analysis, we are forecasting continued losses and negative cash flow for our Tantaline product line and as a consequence, we have implemented plans to eliminate further investment in our Tantaline product line, which will result in the avoidance of approximately $1.5-$2.0 million in additional costs. In addition, we have recorded an impairment charge of $3.6 million in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2020. Based upon certain decisions and actions currently being reviewed, there may be additional costs to be incurred, inclusive of employee related and lease termination costs estimated at approximately $400,000. In order to increase our liquidity and to provide necessary working capital to support our on-going business and operations, we have decided to sell the 555 Building. We have determined the 555 Building is not needed for present and future business operations. We have concluded that any remaining elements of the Materials Business can be consolidated into the 355 Building, which we believe can accommodate any needs for our growth for the foreseeable future. 17  Our continuing operating losses and decline in revenues may make it difficult for us to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If any financing is not available if and when required on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or, even if available and we issue additional common stock, it may materially dilute the ownership interests of the then existing shareholders.  A pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease such as COVID-19 in the United States or worldwide has adversely affected our business. Our operations expose us to risks associated with pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies, such as the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which has spread from China to the rest of the world.  Outbreaks such as these have resulted, and can continue to result, in governments around the world implementing increasingly stringent measures to help control the spread, including quarantines, ""shelter in place"" and ""stay at home"" orders, travel restrictions, business curtailments, school closures, and other measures.  These actions with respect to the COVID-19 outbreak have negatively impacted, and could continue to have negative impacts on, our operations, supply chain, transportation networks, customers and employees.  The COVID-19 outbreak has materially and adversely affected, and any continuing economic downturn as a result of this pandemic could continue to adversely affect, demand for our products, and negatively impact our business or results of operations through the temporary closure of our operating locations or those of our customers or suppliers. In particular, the aerospace sector, for which we rely on a significant part of our business, has been faced with significant reductions to its business due to lack of air travel. Since the end of our first quarter 2020, we have experienced the impacts of COVID-19 on our markets and operations which have included significant decreases in demand, supply chain disruptions, and logistics constraints.  Given government mandates and concerns over employee safety, some of our production facilities were closed or significantly slowed production during the end of the first quarter 2020 and into the second quarter 2020.  The extent to which COVID-19 has and may continue to adversely impact our business depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including new information concerning the severity of the outbreak and the effectiveness of actions globally to contain or mitigate its effects.  While we expect this matter to materially and adversely impact our financial results, the current level of uncertainty over the economic and operational impacts of COVID-19 means the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 18  We have made investments in our proprietary technologies. If third parties violate our proprietary rights, or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietary rights, such events could result in a loss of value of some of our intellectual property or costly litigation. Our success is dependent in part on our technologies and our other proprietary rights.  We believe that while patents can be useful and may be utilized by us in the future, they are not always necessary or feasible to protect our intellectual property. The process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive, and we cannot be certain that applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us.  In addition to patent protection, we have also historically protected our proprietary information and intellectual property such as design specifications, blueprints, technical processes and employee know-how, by limiting access to this confidential information and trade secrets and through the use of non-disclosure agreements. Other companies and individuals, including our larger competitors, may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology, or design around the intellectual property that we own or license.  Our failure to adequately protect our intellectual property, could result in the reduction or extinguishment of our rights to such intellectual property. We also assert rights to certain trademarks relating to certain of our products and product lines. We have not filed trademark applications to protect such marks with any governmental agency, including, but not limited to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation, but we have not filed any copyright applications with the U.S. Copyright Office in connection with those works.  As a result, we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties.  While patent, copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property may be important, we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel.  We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through other internal security measures.  However, these employees, consultants and third parties may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing.  In addition, the laws of certain territories in which we sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Occasionally, we may receive communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights or other intellectual property rights that they believe cover certain of our products, processes, technologies or information. In addition, it is possible we could have a dispute with a customer on intellectual property utilized in their equipment.  If such cases arise, we will evaluate our position and consider the available alternatives, which may include seeking licenses to use the technology in question on commercially reasonable terms, developing new alternative technology or defending our position.  Nevertheless, we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain licenses, or, if we are able to obtain licenses, that related terms will be acceptable, or that litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur.  Defending our intellectual property rights through litigation could be very costly.  If we are not able to negotiate the necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or successfully defend our position, our ability to utilize such intellectual property could substantially inhibit our access to certain markets and our ability to compete in these markets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. 19  We have a highly concentrated customer base so that changes in ordering patterns, delays or order cancellations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Two customers represented 30.5% in total and two customers represented 39.3%, respectively, of our annual revenues in fiscal years 2020 and 2019. We believe that our relationships with these customers are positive and may provide us with ongoing continuous sustainability for years to come, however the loss of a large customer would have to be replaced by others, and our inability to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We expect that contracts or orders from a relatively limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our business. The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. If any of our significant customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, we may not be able to replace the business in a timely manner or at all, which can and has had a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Major customers may also seek, and on occasion receive, pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to us and can hurt our competitive position. Our lengthy and variable sales cycle makes it difficult to predict our financial results. The marketing, sale and manufacture of our products, often requires a lengthy sales cycle ranging from several months to over one year before we can complete production and delivery. The lengthy sales cycle makes forecasting the volume and timing of sales difficult, and raises additional risks that customers may cancel or decide not to enter into contracts. The length of the sales cycle depends on the size and complexity of the project, the customer’s in-depth evaluation of our products, and, in some cases, the protracted nature of a bidding process. Because a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed, we have and may continue to incur substantial expense before we earn associated revenue. If customer cancellations occur, they could result in the loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our operating expenses. We have and may continue to be required to take additional impairment charges on assets. We are required to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment, or on an interim basis, whenever certain events occur or circumstances change, such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount. We are also required to test our long-lived assets, including acquired intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, for recoverability and impairment whenever there are indicators or impairment, such as an adverse change in business climate. As part of our long-term strategy, we have pursued acquisitions of other companies or assets, such as our acquisitions of assets owned by Tantaline ApS and MesoScribe Technologies, Inc. and may pursue future acquisitions of other companies or assets which could potentially increase our assets. Adverse changes in business conditions could materially impact our estimates of future operations and result in impairment charges to these assets. If our assets were impaired, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 20  Following our recent change in management, we began an intensive analysis of our entire business and operations including the Materials Business. Based upon that analysis we believe our primary focus should be on the core equipment business and that the Materials Business strategy should be revised, with some of its current elements potentially minimized or ceased.  Based upon this analysis, we are forecasting continued losses and negative cash flow for our Tantaline product line and as a consequence, we have implemented plans to eliminate further investment in our Tantaline product line, which will result in the avoidance of approximately $1.5-$2.0 million in additional costs. In addition, we have recorded an impairment charge of $3.6 million in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2020. Based upon certain decisions and actions currently being reviewed, there may be additional costs to be incurred, inclusive of employee related and lease termination costs estimated at approximately $400,000. Our success is highly dependent on the technical, sales, marketing and managerial contributions of key individuals, including our newly appointed Chief Executive Officer and President, and we may be unable to retain these individuals or recruit others. We depend on our senior executives including our newly appointed Chief Executive Officer and President, and certain key managers as well as, engineering, research and development, sales, marketing and manufacturing personnel, who are critical to our business. We do not have long-term employment agreements with our key employees. Furthermore, larger competitors may be able to offer more generous compensation packages to our executives and key employees, and therefore we risk losing key personnel to those competitors. If we were to lose the services of any of our key personnel, our engineering, product development, manufacturing and sales efforts could be slowed. We may also incur increased operating expenses, and be required to divert the attention of our senior executives to search for their replacements. The integration of any new personnel could disrupt our ongoing operations. Acquisitions can result in an increase in our operating costs, divert management’s attention away from other operational matters and expose us to other associated risks. We continually evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses and technologies, and we consider targeted acquisitions that expand our core competencies to be an important part of our future growth strategy.  In the past, we have made acquisitions of other businesses with synergistic products, services and technologies, and plan to continue to do so in the future.  Acquisitions involve numerous risks, which include but are not limited to:  ●difficulties and increased costs in connection with the integration of the personnel, operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies into our existing facilities and operations; ●diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters; ●failure to commercialize the acquired technology; ●the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies; ●lack of synergy, or inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisitions; ●the risk that the issuance of our common stock, if any, in an acquisition or merger could be dilutive to our shareholders; ●the inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies and ●the acquired assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired assets. 21  If demand declines for chemical vapor deposition, gas control and related equipment, or for carbon nanotube and nanowire deposition systems, our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our products are utilized to develop and manufacture materials and coatings for industrial and research applications that are used in numerous markets including but not limited to aerospace, medical, solar, nano and advanced electronic components. A significant part of our growth strategy involves continued expansion of the sales of our products for industrial as well as research and development purposes by companies, universities and government-funded research laboratories. The availability of funds for these purposes may be subject to budgetary and political restrictions, as well as cost-cutting measures by manufacturers in the markets in which we operate. If the availability of funds or the demand for capital equipment in the markets in which we operate declines, the demand for our products would also decline and our financial position and results of operations could be harmed.  The conditions of the markets in which we operate are volatile. The demand for our products and the profitability of our products can change significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors. The industries in which we operate are characterized by ongoing changes, including:  ●the availability of funds for research and development; ●global and regional economic conditions; ●governmental budgetary and political constraints; ●changes in the capacity utilization and production volume for research and industrial applications in the markets in which we operate; ●the profitability and capital resources of manufacturers in the markets in which we operate; and ●changes in technology. For these and other reasons, our results of operations for past periods may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results. Volatile and cyclical demand for our products may make it difficult for us to accurately budget our expense levels, which are based in part on our projections of future revenues. Demand for our equipment and related consumable products may be volatile as a result of sudden changes in supply and demand, and other factors in the manufacturing process. Our orders tend to be more volatile than our revenue, as any change in demand is reflected immediately in orders booked, which are net of cancellations, while revenue, tends to be recognized over multiple quarters as a result of procurement and production lead times, and the deferral of certain revenue under our revenue recognition policies. The fiscal period in which we are able to recognize revenue is also at times subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment. This could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate. 22  When cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results have been and may continue to be materially adversely affected and cost reduction measures have been and may continue to be necessary for us to remain competitive and financially sound. During a down cycle, we must be able to make timely adjustments to our cost and expense structure to correspond to the prevailing market conditions. In addition, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and the number of our personnel to meet customer demand, which may require additional liquidity. We can provide no assurance, that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to changes within the industry cycles in which we operate. If we fail to respond to these cyclical changes, our business could be seriously harmed. In 2018, 2019 and 2020, we reported pre-tax income (loss) of ($5,558,000), ($4,914,000) and ($7,602,000), respectively. We do not have long-term volume production contracts with our customers, and we do not control the timing or volume of orders placed by our customers. Whether and to what extent our customers place orders for any specific products, and the mix and quantities of products included in those orders are factors beyond our control. Insufficient orders would result in under-utilization of our manufacturing facilities and infrastructure, and will negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. We face significant competition and we are relatively small in size and have fewer resources in comparison with many of our competitors. We face significant competition throughout the world, which may increase as certain markets in which we operate continue to evolve. Our future performance depends, in part, upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide. Some of our competitors are diversified companies that have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive research, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we can provide. We face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products, some of which compete with the products and services that we offer, as well as companies, universities and research laboratories that have the capacity to design and build their own equipment internally. These competitors may bundle their products and services in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products. In addition, we face competition from smaller emerging processing equipment companies, whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer at often lower prices than ours, using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets. Loss of competitive position could impair our prices, customer orders, revenue, gross margin and market share, any of which would negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. Our failure to compete successfully with these other companies would seriously harm our business. There is a risk that larger, better financed competitors will develop and market more advanced products than those we currently offer, or that competitors with greater financial resources may decrease prices, thereby putting us under financial pressure. 23  The health and environmental effects of nanotechnology are unknown, and this uncertainty could adversely affect the expansion of our business. The health and environmental effects of nanotechnology are unknown. There is no scientific agreement on the health effects of nanomaterials in general and carbon nanotubes, in particular, but some scientists believe that in some cases, nanomaterials may be hazardous to an individual’s health or to the environment. The science of nanotechnology is based on arranging atoms in such a way as to modify or build materials not made in nature; therefore, the effects are unknown. Future research into the effects of nanomaterials in general, and carbon nanotubes in particular, on health and environmental issues, may have an adverse effect on products incorporating nanotechnology. Since part of our growth strategy is based on sales of research equipment for the production of carbon nanotubes and the sale of such materials, the determination that these materials are harmful could adversely affect the expansion of our business. We may experience increasing price pressure. Our historical business strategy for many of our products has focused on product performance and customer service rather than on price. As a result of budgetary constraints, many of our customers are extremely price sensitive when purchasing capital equipment. If we are unable to obtain prices that allow us to continue to compete on the basis of product performance and customer service, our profit margins will be reduced. We may not be able to keep pace with the rapid change in the technology we use in our products. We believe that our continued success in the markets in which we operate depends, in part, on our ability to continually improve existing technologies and to develop and manufacture new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. We must be able to introduce these products and product enhancements into the market in a timely manner, in response to customer’s demands for higher-performance research and assembly equipment, customized to address rapid technological advances in capital equipment designs. Technological innovations are inherently complex, and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing. Our future business success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products, or new uses for existing products, that successfully address changing customer needs. Our success also depends on our ability to achieve market acceptance of our new products. In order to maintain our success in the marketplace, we may have to substantially increase our expenditures on research and development. If we do not develop and introduce new products, technologies or uses for existing products in a timely manner and continually find ways to reduce the cost of developing and producing them in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, our business could be seriously harmed. 24  Manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect our ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs, while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory. Our business depends on timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of our customers. Some key parts to our products are subject to long lead-times and/or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers. Cyclical industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for us and for companies throughout our supply chain. Further, these conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations. We may also experience significant interruptions of our manufacturing operations, delays in our ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:  ●The failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis; ●Volatility in the availability and cost of materials, including rare earth elements; ●Difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals; ●Information technology or infrastructure failures; and ●Natural disasters or other events beyond our control (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war). ●The effects of COVID-19 on our employees, suppliers and other third-parties upon which we rely. For example, we may source certain materials used in the development and manufacture of our products from regions affected by the COVID-19, which could make access to our supply chain difficult and could affect our business. If a supplier fails to meet our requirements concerning quality, cost, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, we may transfer our business to alternative sources, which could entail manufacturing delays, additional costs, or other difficulties. In addition, if we need to rapidly increase our business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may exacerbate any interruptions in our manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on our working capital. 25  If any of our customers cancel or fail to accept a large system order, our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our backlog, consists of orders for customized systems including our chemical vapor deposition equipment and annealing and diffusion furnaces which are built to client specifications. We also have a significant concentration of revenue with customers exceeding 10% of revenues. Two customers represented 30.5% in total and two customers represented 39.3%, respectively, of our annual revenues in fiscal years 2020 and 2019. These customized systems can have prices that range from $100,000 to several million dollars, depending on the configuration, specific options included and any special requirements of the customer.  Because our orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer, our backlog at any particular point in time is not necessarily representative of actual sales for succeeding periods, nor does our backlog provide any assurance of achievement of revenues or that we will realize a profit from completing these orders.  Our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected should any large system order be cancelled prior to shipment, or not be accepted by the customer due to alleged non-conformity with product specifications or otherwise. Likewise, a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of our customers that purchase large systems, could have a material impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results.  Our backlog does not provide any assurance that we will realize a profit from those orders, or indicate in which period revenue will be recognized. We may not be able to hire or retain the number of qualified personnel, particularly engineering personnel, required for our business, which would harm the development and sales of our products and limit our ability to grow.  Competition in our industry for senior management, technical, sales, marketing and other key personnel is intense. If we are unable to retain our existing personnel, or attract and train additional qualified personnel, our growth may be limited due to a lack of capacity to develop and market our products. In particular, we have, from time to time, experienced difficulty in hiring and retaining skilled engineers with appropriate qualifications to support our growth strategy. Our success depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified engineering personnel with experience in equipment design. Specifically, we need to continue to attract and retain mechanical, electrical, software and field service engineers to work with our direct sales force to technically qualify and perform on new sales opportunities and orders, and to demonstrate our products. Our financial position and results of operations may be materially harmed if we are unable to recoup our investment in research and development. The rapid change in technology in our industry requires that we continue to make substantial investments in research and development and selective acquisitions of technologies and products, in order to enhance the performance and functionality of our product line, to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands for improved performance, features and functionality.  These efforts include those related to the development of technology for the commercialization of carbon nanotubes. There can be no assurance that revenue from future products or enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products, enhancements or acquisitions, or that we will be able to secure the financial resources necessary to fund future research and development or acquisitions.  Research and development costs are typically incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a product, and not all development activities result in commercially viable products.  In addition, we cannot ensure that products or enhancements will receive market acceptance, or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us.  Our business could be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices, or if our products are not accepted by the markets in which we operate. 26  Our reputation and operating performance may be negatively affected if our products are not timely delivered. We provide complex products that often require substantial lead-time for design, ordering parts and materials, and for assembly and installation. The time required to design, order parts and materials and to manufacture, assemble and install our products, may in turn lead to delays or shortages in the availability of some products. If a product is delayed or is the subject of shortage because of problems with our ability to design, manufacture or assemble the product on a timely basis, or if a product or software otherwise fails to meet performance criteria, we may lose revenue opportunities entirely, or experience delays in revenue recognition associated with a product or service. In addition, we may incur higher operating expenses during the period required to correct the problem. Our business might be adversely affected by our dependence on foreign business. During the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately $2.8 million or 16.8% of our revenues were generated by sales to customers outside the U.S. compared to approximately $4.2 million or 21.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Because a portion of our revenues are derived from international customers, our operating results could be negatively affected by a decline in the economies of any of the countries or regions in which we do business.  Each region can exhibit unique characteristics, which can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period.  Periodic local or international economic downturns, trade balance issues and political instability, as well as fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates, could negatively affect our business and results of operations. All of our sales to date have been primarily priced in U.S. dollars. While our business has not been materially affected in the past by currency fluctuations, there is a risk that it may be materially adversely affected in the future.  Such risks include possible losses due to both currency exchange rate fluctuations and from possible social and political instability.  If our critical suppliers fail to deliver sufficient quantities of quality materials and components in a timely and cost-effective manner, it could negatively affect our business. We do not manufacture many components used in the production of our products, and consequently, we use numerous unrelated suppliers of materials and components.  We generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers.  Because of the variability and uniqueness of our customer’s orders, we try to avoid maintaining an extensive inventory of materials and components for manufacturing. While we are not dependent on any principal or major supplier for most of our material and component needs, switching over to an alternative supplier may take significant amounts of time and added expense, which could result in a disruption of our operations and adversely affect our business. 27  It is not always practical or even possible to ensure that component parts are available from multiple suppliers; accordingly, we procure some key parts from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers.  At certain times, increases in demand for capital equipment can result in longer lead-times for many important system components, which may cause delays in meeting shipments to our customers.  The delay in the shipment of even a few systems could cause significant variations in our quarterly revenue, operating results and the market value of our common stock.  We cannot assure you that our financial position and results of operations will not be materially and adversely affected if, in the future, we do not receive in a timely and cost-effective manner a sufficient quantity of quality component parts and materials to meet our production requirements. The price of our common shares is volatile and could decline significantly. The stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular has experienced volatility. If those industry-based market fluctuations continue, the trading price of our common shares could decline significantly independent of the overall market, and shareholders could lose all or a substantial part of their investment. The market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors, including, among others:  ●difficult macroeconomic conditions, unfavorable geopolitical events, and general stock market uncertainties, such as those occasioned by a global liquidity crisis and a failure of large financial institutions; ●receipt of large orders or cancellations of orders for our products; ●issues associated with the performance and reliability of our products; ●actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations; ●announcements of financial developments or technological innovations; ●changes in recommendations and/or financial estimates by investment research analysis; ●strategic transactions, such as acquisitions, divestitures, or spin-offs; and ●the occurrence of major catastrophic events, including the effects of the spread of COVID-19 ●trading volume is low Significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to our publicly traded securities and technology companies generally. The price of our common shares is likely to be volatile in the future. In the past, securities class action litigation often has been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. If similar litigation were pursued against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. We face the risk of product liability claims.  The manufacture and sale of our products, which in operation sometimes involve the use of toxic materials and extreme temperatures, and could result in product liability claims.  For example, our rapid thermal processing systems used to heat semiconductor materials to temperatures in excess of 1000º Celsius have certain inherent risks.  A failure of our product(s) at a customer site could also result in losses due to interruption of the business operations of our customer. While we regularly evaluate the nature and limits of our insurance coverages, there can be no assurance that our existing policies of insurance will be adequate to protect us from all liabilities that we might incur in connection with the manufacture and sale of our products in the event of a successful product liability claim or series of successful claims against us. 28  We are subject to environmental regulations, and our inability or failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business. We are subject to environmental regulations in connection with our business operations, including regulations related to the development and manufacture of our products and our customers’ use of our products. Our failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental regulations could result in significant remediation liabilities, the imposition of fines or the suspension or termination of development, manufacturing or use of certain of our products, or affect the operation of our facilities, use or value of our real property, each of which could damage our financial position and results of operations. If we are subject to cyber-attacks we could incur substantial costs and, if such attacks are successful, we could incur significant liabilities, reputational harm, and disruption to our operations. We manage, store and transmit proprietary information and sensitive data relating to our operations. We may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use for these purposes. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate and/or compromise our confidential information (and or third-party confidential information), create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or our products, or that otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. The costs to address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers, impeding our sales, manufacturing, distribution, or other critical functions. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive data about us, our customer, or other third parties, could expose us, our customers, or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business. Regulations related to conflict minerals will force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chains more complex, and may result in damage to our relationships with customers. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted requirements for companies that manufacture products that contain certain minerals and metals known as “conflict minerals”. These rules require public companies to perform diligence and to report annually to the SEC whether such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of minerals we use in the manufacture of our products. In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products. Given the complexity of our supply chain, we may not be able to ascertain the origins of these minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as conflict mineral free, which could harm our relationships with these customers and lead to a loss of revenue. These requirements could limit the pool of suppliers that can provide conflict-free minerals, and we may be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at competitive prices, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability. 29  Failure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have agreements with third parties and make sales in countries known to experience corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices. We can make no assurance, however, that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. "
8,CVV,CVD EQUIPMENT CORP,2020-03-30,"     Risk Factors
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our shareholders should carefully consider the risk factors described below. The risks set forth below may not be the only risk factors relating to the Company. Any of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and stock price. We have significant investments in our CVD Materials segment, which could be met with further delays and ongoing losses that could materially and adversely impact our financial results and cash flow. To support the expected growth of our CVD Materials segment and to house the US based business, on November 30, 2017, we purchased the premises located at 555 North Research Place, Central Islip, NY (the “Premises”). The purchase price of the building was $13,850,000, exclusive of closing costs. We have monthly principle and interest payments of $62,481 and have invested $2.7 million and $2.5 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively, in building improvements, machinery, and other expenses related primarily to CVD Materials. Since September 2019, Mesoscribe™ has secured orders of approximately $2 million, and in early 2020 we have hired four employees including test and project management to support those orders and growth opportunities. Tantaline® US equipment systems continue to be installed and are in various stages of process testing and refinement. We have continued to increase our marketing efforts for equipment and materials, and in February 2020 we hired a salesman specific to Tantaline®. If we are unable to reach profitable operations and not recover our investment, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Business or economic disruptions or global health concerns could seriously harm our business. Broad-based business or economic disruptions could adversely affect our business and the sale of our products. For example, in December 2019 an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China, and has since spread to a number of other countries, including the United States. Initially, this outbreak resulted in extended shutdowns of certain businesses in the Wuhan region and had ripple effects to businesses around the world. Most recently this disruption has extended to the United States including complete or partial government shutdowns of many businesses, schools, bars and restaurants, including our Company. We cannot presently predict the scope and severity of the business shutdowns or disruptions to us, but if we or any of the third parties with whom we engage, including our customers, suppliers and other third parties with whom we conduct business, were to experience extended shutdowns or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business could be materially and negatively impacted, and could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operation and financial condition. 13  We have a highly concentrated customer base so that changes in ordering patterns, delays or order cancellations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Two customers represented 39.3% in total and one customer represented 38.2%, respectively, of our annual revenues in fiscal years 2019 and 2018. We believe that our relationships with these customers are positive and may provide us with ongoing continuous sustainability for years to come, however the loss of a large customer would have to be replaced by others, and our inability to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We expect that contracts or orders from a relatively limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our business. The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. If any of our significant customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, we may not be able to replace the business in a timely manner or at all, which can and has had a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Major customers may also seek, and on occasion receive, pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to us and can hurt our competitive position. Our lengthy and variable sales cycle makes it difficult to predict our financial results. The marketing, sale and manufacture of our products, often requires a lengthy sales cycle ranging from several months to over one year before we can complete production and delivery. The lengthy sales cycle makes forecasting the volume and timing of sales difficult, and raises additional risks that customers may cancel or decide not to enter into contracts. The length of the sales cycle depends on the size and complexity of the project, the customer’s in-depth evaluation of our products, and, in some cases, the protracted nature of a bidding process. Because a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed, we have and may continue to incur substantial expense before we earn associated revenue. If customer cancellations occur, they could result in the loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our operating expenses. Our success is highly dependent on the technical, sales, marketing and managerial contributions of key individuals, including Leonard A. Rosenbaum, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President, and we may be unable to retain these individuals or recruit others. We depend on our senior executives, including Leonard A. Rosenbaum, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President, and certain key managers as well as, engineering, research and development, sales, marketing and manufacturing personnel, who are critical to our business. We do not have long-term employment agreements with our key employees. We presently have a key person life insurance policy on the life of Leonard A. Rosenbaum, for a total insured amount of $5 million, which may not be sufficient to cover our loss of Mr. Rosenbaum’s services. Furthermore, larger competitors may be able to offer more generous compensation packages to our executives and key employees, and therefore we risk losing key personnel to those competitors. If we were to lose the services of any of our key personnel, our engineering, product development, manufacturing and sales efforts could be slowed. We may also incur increased operating expenses, and be required to divert the attention of our senior executives to search for their replacements. The integration of any new personnel could disrupt our ongoing operations. 14  Acquisitions can result in an increase in our operating costs, divert management’s attention away from other operational matters and expose us to other associated risks. We continually evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses and technologies, and we consider targeted acquisitions that expand our core competencies to be an important part of our future growth strategy.  In the past, we have made acquisitions of other businesses with synergistic products, services and technologies, and plan to continue to do so in the future.  Acquisitions involve numerous risks, which include but are not limited to:  ●difficulties and increased costs in connection with the integration of the personnel, operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies into our existing facilities and operations; ●diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters; ●failure to commercialize the acquired technology; ●the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies; ●lack of synergy, or inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisitions; ●the risk that the issuance of our common stock, if any, in an acquisition or merger could be dilutive to our shareholders; ●the inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies and ●the acquired assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired assets. If demand declines for chemical vapor deposition, gas control and related equipment, or for carbon nanotube and nanowire deposition systems, our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our products are utilized to develop and manufacture materials and coatings for industrial and research applications that are used in numerous markets including but not limited to aerospace, medical, solar, nano and advanced electronic components. A significant part of our growth strategy involves continued expansion of the sales of our products for industrial as well as research and development purposes by companies, universities and government-funded research laboratories. The availability of funds for these purposes may be subject to budgetary and political restrictions, as well as cost-cutting measures by manufacturers in the markets in which we operate. If the availability of funds or the demand for capital equipment in the markets in which we operate declines, the demand for our products would also decline and our financial position and results of operations could be harmed. 15  The conditions of the markets in which we operate are volatile. The demand for our products and the profitability of our products can change significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors. The industries in which we operate are characterized by ongoing changes, including:  ●the availability of funds for research and development; ●global and regional economic conditions; ●governmental budgetary and political constraints; ●changes in the capacity utilization and production volume for research and industrial applications in the markets in which we operate; ●the profitability and capital resources of manufacturers in the markets in which we operate; and ●changes in technology. For these and other reasons, our results of operations for past periods may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results. Volatile and cyclical demand for our products may make it difficult for us to accurately budget our expense levels, which are based in part on our projections of future revenues. Demand for our equipment and related consumable products may be volatile as a result of sudden changes in supply and demand, and other factors in the manufacturing process. Our orders tend to be more volatile than our revenue, as any change in demand is reflected immediately in orders booked, which are net of cancellations, while revenue, tends to be recognized over multiple quarters as a result of procurement and production lead times, and the deferral of certain revenue under our revenue recognition policies. The fiscal period in which we are able to recognize revenue is also at times subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment. This could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate. When cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results may be materially adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary for us to remain competitive and financially sound. During a down cycle, we must be able to make timely adjustments to our cost and expense structure to correspond to the prevailing market conditions. In addition, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and the number of our personnel to meet customer demand, which may require additional liquidity. We can provide no assurance, that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to changes within the industry cycles in which we operate. If we fail to respond to these cyclical changes, our business could be seriously harmed. In 2017, 2018 and 2019, we reported pre-tax income (loss) of $7,195,000, ($5,558,000) and ($4,914,000), respectively. We do not have long-term volume production contracts with our customers, and we do not control the timing or volume of orders placed by our customers. Whether and to what extent our customers place orders for any specific products, and the mix and quantities of products included in those orders are factors beyond our control. Insufficient orders would result in under-utilization of our manufacturing facilities and infrastructure, and will negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. 16  We face significant competition and we are relatively small in size and have fewer resources in comparison with many of our competitors. We face significant competition throughout the world, which may increase as certain markets in which we operate continue to evolve. Our future performance depends, in part, upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide. Some of our competitors are diversified companies that have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive research, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we can provide. We face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products, some of which compete with the products and services that we offer, as well as companies, universities and research laboratories that have the capacity to design and build their own equipment internally. These competitors may bundle their products and services in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products. In addition, we face competition from smaller emerging processing equipment companies, whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer at often lower prices than ours, using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets. Loss of competitive position could impair our prices, customer orders, revenue, gross margin and market share, any of which would negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. Our failure to compete successfully with these other companies would seriously harm our business. There is a risk that larger, better financed competitors will develop and market more advanced products than those we currently offer, or that competitors with greater financial resources may decrease prices, thereby putting us under financial pressure. The health and environmental effects of nanotechnology are unknown, and this uncertainty could adversely affect the expansion of our business. The health and environmental effects of nanotechnology are unknown. There is no scientific agreement on the health effects of nanomaterials in general and carbon nanotubes, in particular, but some scientists believe that in some cases, nanomaterials may be hazardous to an individual’s health or to the environment.The science of nanotechnology is based on arranging atoms in such a way as to modify or build materials not made in nature; therefore, the effects are unknown. Future research into the effects of nanomaterials in general, and carbon nanotubes in particular, on health and environmental issues, may have an adverse effect on products incorporating nanotechnology. Since part of our growth strategy is based on sales of research equipment for the production of carbon nanotubes and the sale of such materials, the determination that these materials are harmful could adversely affect the expansion of our business. We may experience increasing price pressure. Our historical business strategy for many of our products has focused on product performance and customer service rather than on price. As a result of budgetary constraints, many of our customers are extremely price sensitive when purchasing of capital equipment. If we are unable to obtain prices that allow us to continue to compete on the basis of product performance and customer service, our profit margins will be reduced. 17  We may not be able to keep pace with the rapid change in the technology we use in our products. We believe that our continued success in the markets in which we operate depends, in part, on our ability to continually improve existing technologies and to develop and manufacture new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. We must be able to introduce these products and product enhancements into the market in a timely manner, in response to customer’s demands for higher-performance research and assembly equipment, customized to address rapid technological advances in capital equipment designs. Technological innovations are inherently complex, and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing. Our future business success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products, or new uses for existing products, that successfully address changing customer needs. Our success also depends on our ability to achieve market acceptance of our new products. In order to maintain our success in the marketplace, we may have to substantially increase our expenditures on research and development. If we do not develop and introduce new products, technologies or uses for existing products in a timely manner and continually find ways to reduce the cost of developing and producing them in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, our business could be seriously harmed. Manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect our ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs, while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory. Our business depends on timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of our customers. Some key parts to our products are subject to long lead-times and/or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers. Cyclical industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for us and for companies throughout our supply chain. Further, these conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations. We may also experience significant interruptions of our manufacturing operations, delays in our ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:  ●The failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis; ●Volatility in the availability and cost of materials, including rare earth elements; ●Difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals; ●Information technology or infrastructure failures; and 18   ●Natural disasters or other events beyond our control (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war). ●The effects of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) on our employees, suppliers and other third-parties upon which we rely. For example, we may source certain materials used in the development and manufacture of our products from regions affected by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which could make access to our supply chain difficult and could affect our business. If a supplier fails to meet our requirements concerning quality, cost, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, we may transfer our business to alternative sources, which could entail manufacturing delays, additional costs, or other difficulties. In addition, if we need to rapidly increase our business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may exacerbate any interruptions in our manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on our working capital. If any of our customers cancel or fail to accept a large system order, our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our backlog, largely consists of orders for customized systems including our chemical vapor deposition equipment and annealing and diffusion furnaces which are built to client specifications. We also have a significant concentration of revenue with customers exceeding 10% of revenues. Two customers represented 39.3% in total and one customer represented 38.2%, respectively, of our annual revenues in fiscal years 2019 and 2018. These customized systems can have prices that range from $100,000 to several million dollars, depending on the configuration, specific options included and any special requirements of the customer.  Because our orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer, our backlog at any particular point in time is not necessarily representative of actual sales for succeeding periods, nor does our backlog provide any assurance of achievement of revenues or that we will realize a profit from completing these orders.  Our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected should any large system order be cancelled prior to shipment, or not be accepted by the customer due to alleged non-conformity with product specifications or otherwise. Likewise, a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of our customers that purchase large systems, could have a material impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results.  Our backlog does not provide any assurance that we will realize a profit from those orders, or indicate in which period revenue will be recognized. We may not be able to hire or retain the number of qualified personnel, particularly engineering personnel, required for our business, which would harm the development and sales of our products and limit our ability to grow.  Competition in our industry for senior management, technical, sales, marketing and other key personnel is intense. If we are unable to retain our existing personnel, or attract and train additional qualified personnel, our growth may be limited due to a lack of capacity to develop and market our products. 19  In particular, we have, from time to time, experienced difficulty in hiring and retaining skilled engineers with appropriate qualifications to support our growth strategy. Our success depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified engineering personnel with experience in equipment design. Specifically, we need to continue to attract and retain mechanical, electrical, software and field service engineers to work with our direct sales force to technically qualify and perform on new sales opportunities and orders, and to demonstrate our products. Our financial position and results of operations may be materially harmed if we are unable to recoup our investment in research and development. The rapid change in technology in our industry requires that we continue to make substantial investments in research and development and selective acquisitions of technologies and products, in order to enhance the performance and functionality of our product line, to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands for improved performance, features and functionality.  These efforts include those related to the development of technology for the commercialization of carbon nanotubes. There can be no assurance that revenue from future products or enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products, enhancements or acquisitions, or that we will be able to secure the financial resources necessary to fund future research and development or acquisitions.  Research and development costs are typically incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a product, and not all development activities result in commercially viable products.  In addition, we cannot ensure that products or enhancements will receive market acceptance, or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us.  Our business could be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices, or if our products are not accepted by the markets in which we operate. We have made investments in our proprietary technologies. If third parties violate our proprietary rights, or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietary rights, such events could result in a loss of value of some of our intellectual property or costly litigation. Our success is dependent in part on our technologies and our other proprietary rights.  We believe that while patents can be useful and may be utilized by us in the future, they are not always necessary or feasible to protect our intellectual property. The process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive, and we cannot be certain that applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us.  In addition to patent protection, we have also historically protected our proprietary information and intellectual property such as design specifications, blueprints, technical processes and employee know-how, by limiting access to this confidential information and trade secrets and through the use of non-disclosure agreements. Other companies and individuals, including our larger competitors, may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology, or design around the intellectual property that we own or license.  Our failure to adequately protect our intellectual property, could result in the reduction or extinguishment of our rights to such intellectual property. We also assert rights to certain trademarks relating to certain of our products and product lines. We have not filed trademark applications to protect such marks with any governmental agency, including, but not limited to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation, but we have not filed any copyright applications with the U.S. Copyright Office in connection with those works.  As a result, we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties.  20  While patent, copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property may be important, we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel.  We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through other internal security measures.  However, these employees, consultants and third parties may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing.  In addition, the laws of certain territories in which we sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Occasionally, we may receive communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights or other intellectual property rights that they believe cover certain of our products, processes, technologies or information.  If such cases arise, we will evaluate our position and consider the available alternatives, which may include seeking licenses to use the technology in question on commercially reasonable terms, or defending our position.  Nevertheless, we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain licenses, or, if we are able to obtain licenses, that related terms will be acceptable, or that litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur.  Defending our intellectual property rights through litigation could be very costly.  If we are not able to negotiate the necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or successfully defend our position, our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our reputation and operating performance may be negatively affected if our products are not timely delivered. We provide complex products that often require substantial lead-time for design, ordering parts and materials, and for assembly and installation. The time required to design, order parts and materials and to manufacture, assemble and install our products, may in turn lead to delays or shortages in the availability of some products. If a product is delayed or is the subject of shortage because of problems with our ability to design, manufacture or assemble the product on a timely basis, or if a product or software otherwise fails to meet performance criteria, we may lose revenue opportunities entirely, or experience delays in revenue recognition associated with a product or service. In addition, we may incur higher operating expenses during the period required to correct the problem. We need to manage the growth of our CVD Materials operations effectively or we may experience difficulty in filling customer orders, declining product quality, increased costs or other operating challenges. We anticipate that growth of our operations will be required to satisfy our projected increase in demand for our products and to avail ourselves of new market opportunities. The expanding scope of our business and the growth in the number of our employees, customers and products have placed and will continue to place a significant strain on our management, information technology systems, manufacturing facilities and other resources. To properly manage our growth, we may need to hire additional employees, upgrade our existing financial and reporting systems and improve our business processes and controls. Failure to effectively manage our growth could make it difficult to manufacture our products and fill orders, as well as lead to declines in product quality or increased costs; any of these would adversely impact our business and results of operations. 21  Historically, we have only manufactured in unit or small batch quantities for our systems orders. If we receive orders for a large number of our systems, we may not have the internal manufacturing capacity to fill these orders on a timely basis, if at all, and may be forced to subcontract or outsource some of the fabrication of these systems to third parties. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully subcontract or outsource the fabrication of our systems at a reasonable cost to us, or that such third parties will adhere to our quality control standards. Our business might be adversely affected by our dependence on foreign business.  During the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately $4.2 million or 21.3% of our revenues were generated by sales to customers outside the U.S. compared to approximately $2.4 million or 9.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Because a portion of our revenues are derived from international customers, our operating results could be negatively affected by a decline in the economies of any of the countries or regions in which we do business.  Each region can exhibit unique characteristics, which can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period.  Periodic local or international economic downturns, trade balance issues and political instability, as well as fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates, could negatively affect our business and results of operations. All of our sales to date have been primarily priced in U.S. dollars. While our business has not been materially affected in the past by currency fluctuations, there is a risk that it may be materially adversely affected in the future.  Such risks include possible losses due to both currency exchange rate fluctuations and from possible social and political instability.  If our critical suppliers fail to deliver sufficient quantities of quality materials and components in a timely and cost-effective manner, it could negatively affect our business. We do not manufacture many components used in the production of our products, and consequently, we use numerous unrelated suppliers of materials and components.  We generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers.  Because of the variability and uniqueness of our customer’s orders, we try to avoid maintaining an extensive inventory of materials and components for manufacturing. While we are not dependent on any principal or major supplier for most of our material and component needs, switching over to an alternative supplier may take significant amounts of time and added expense, which could result in a disruption of our operations and adversely affect our business. It is not always practical or even possible to ensure that component parts are available from multiple suppliers; accordingly, we procure some key parts from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers.  At certain times, increases in demand for capital equipment can result in longer lead-times for many important system components, which may cause delays in meeting shipments to our customers.  The delay in the shipment of even a few systems could cause significant variations in our quarterly revenue, operating results and the market value of our common stock.  22  We cannot assure you that our financial position and results of operations will not be materially and adversely affected if, in the future, we do not receive in a timely and cost-effective manner a sufficient quantity of quality component parts and materials to meet our production requirements. We might require additional financing to expand our operations. Although we purchased an additional facility in November 2017, we could require additional financing to support our investment in our CVD Materials segment and to further implement our overall growth plans.  If any additional financing is not available if and when required on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or, even if available and we issue additional common stock, it may materially dilute the ownership interests of the then existing shareholders. We may be required to take additional impairment charges on assets. We are required to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment, or on an interim basis, whenever certain events occur or circumstances change, such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount. We are also required to test our long-lived assets, including acquired intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, for recoverability and impairment whenever there are indicators or impairment, such as an adverse change in business climate. As part of our long-term strategy, we have pursued acquisitions of other companies or assets, such as our recent acquisitions of assets owned by Tantaline ApS and MesoScribe Technologies, Inc. and may pursue future acquisitions of other companies or assets which could potentially increase our assets. Adverse changes in business conditions could materially impact our estimates of future operations and result in impairment charges to these assets. If our assets were impaired, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The price of our common shares is volatile and could decline significantly. The stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular has experienced volatility. If those industry-based market fluctuations continue, the trading price of our common shares could decline significantly independent of the overall market, and shareholders could lose all or a substantial part of their investment. The market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors, including, among others:  ●difficult macroeconomic conditions, unfavorable geopolitical events, and general stock market uncertainties, such as those occasioned by a global liquidity crisis and a failure of large financial institutions; ●receipt of large orders or cancellations of orders for our products; 23   ●issues associated with the performance and reliability of our products; ●actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations; ●announcements of financial developments or technological innovations; ●changes in recommendations and/or financial estimates by investment research analysis; ●strategic transactions, such as acquisitions, divestitures, or spin-offs; and ●the occurrence of major catastrophic events, including the effects of the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) ●trading volume is low Significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to our publicly traded securities and technology companies generally. The price of our common shares is likely to be volatile in the future. In the past, securities class action litigation often has been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. If similar litigation were pursued against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. We face the risk of product liability claims.  The manufacture and sale of our products, which in operation sometimes involve the use of toxic materials and extreme temperatures, and could result in product liability claims.  For example, our rapid thermal processing systems used to heat semiconductor materials to temperatures in excess of 1000º Celsius have certain inherent risks.  A failure of our product(s) at a customer site could also result in losses due to interruption of the business operations of our customer. While we regularly evaluate the nature and limits of our insurance coverages, there can be no assurance that our existing policies of insurance will be adequate to protect us from all liabilities that we might incur in connection with the manufacture and sale of our products in the event of a successful product liability claim or series of successful claims against us. We are subject to environmental regulations, and our inability or failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business. We are subject to environmental regulations in connection with our business operations, including regulations related to the development and manufacture of our products and our customers’ use of our products. Our failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental regulations could result in significant remediation liabilities, the imposition of fines or the suspension or termination of development, manufacturing or use of certain of our products, or affect the operation of our facilities, use or value of our real property, each of which could damage our financial position and results of operations. If we are subject to cyber-attacks we could incur substantial costs and, if such attacks are successful, we could incur significant liabilities, reputational harm, and disruption to our operations. We manage, store and transmit proprietary information and sensitive data relating to our operations. We may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use for these purposes. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate and/or compromise our confidential information (and or third-party confidential information), create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or our products, or that otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. 24  The costs to address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers, impeding our sales, manufacturing, distribution, or other critical functions. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive data about us, our customer, or other third parties, could expose us, our customers, or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business. Regulations related to conflict minerals will force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chains more complex, and may result in damage to our relationships with customers. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted requirements for companies that manufacture products that contain certain minerals and metals known as “conflict minerals”. These rules require public companies to perform diligence and to report annually to the SEC whether such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of minerals we use in the manufacture of our products. In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products. Given the complexity of our supply chain, we may not be able to ascertain the origins of these minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as conflict mineral free, which could harm our relationships with these customers and lead to a loss of revenue. These requirements could limit the pool of suppliers that can provide conflict-free minerals, and we may be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at competitive prices, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability. Failure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have agreements with third parties and make sales in countries known to experience corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices. We can make no assurance, however, that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 25  "
2,CVV,CVD EQUIPMENT CORP,2019-04-01,"     Risk Factors
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our shareholders should carefully consider the risk factors described below. The risks set forth below may not be the only risk factors relating to the Company. Any of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and stock price. We have significant investments in our CVD Materials segment, which could be met with further delays and ongoing losses that could materially and adversely impact our financial results and cash flow. To support the expected growth of our CVD Materials segment and to house the US based business, on November 30, 2017, we purchased the premises located at 555 North Research Place, Central Islip, NY (the “Premises”). The purchase price of the building was $13,850,000, exclusive of closing costs. We have monthly principle and interest payments of $62,481 and we have invested $2.5 million during 2018, principally for capital improvements and equipment for this business. We anticipate investing approximately $1.5 to $2 million for additional building improvements and machinery. Expenses for this building totaled $750,000 in 2018 related to interest expense of $405,000 and real estate taxes and other operating costs $345,000. If we are unable to reach profitable operations and not recover our investment, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We have a highly concentrated customer base so that changes in ordering patterns, delays or order cancellations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  In fiscal 2018 and 2017, approximately 38.2% and 66.1% of our net sales, respectively, was accounted for by one customer. We expect that contracts or orders from a relatively limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our business. The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. If any of our significant customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, we may not be able to replace the business in a timely manner or at all, which can and has had a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Major customers may also seek, and on occasion receive, pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to us and can hurt our competitive position. Our lengthy and variable sales cycle makes it difficult to predict our financial results. The marketing, sale and manufacture of our products, often requires a lengthy sales cycle ranging from several months to over one year before we can complete production and delivery. The lengthy sales cycle makes forecasting the volume and timing of sales difficult, and raises additional risks that customers may cancel or decide not to enter into contracts. The length of the sales cycle depends on the size and complexity of the project, the customer’s in-depth evaluation of our products, and, in some cases, the protracted nature of a bidding process. 12  Because a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed, we may incur substantial expense before we earn associated revenue. If customer cancellations occur, they could result in the loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our operating expenses. Our success is highly dependent on the technical, sales, marketing and managerial contributions of key individuals, including Leonard A. Rosenbaum, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President, and we may be unable to retain these individuals or recruit others. We depend on our senior executives, including Leonard A. Rosenbaum, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President, and certain key managers as well as, engineering, research and development, sales, marketing and manufacturing personnel, who are critical to our business. We do not have long-term employment agreements with our key employees. We presently have a key person life insurance policy on the life of Leonard A. Rosenbaum, for a total insured amount of $5 million, which may not be sufficient to cover our loss of Mr. Rosenbaum’s services. Furthermore, larger competitors may be able to offer more generous compensation packages to our executives and key employees, and therefore we risk losing key personnel to those competitors. If we were to lose the services of any of our key personnel, our engineering, product development, manufacturing and sales efforts could be slowed. We may also incur increased operating expenses, and be required to divert the attention of our senior executives to search for their replacements. The integration of any new personnel could disrupt our ongoing operations. Acquisitions can result in an increase in our operating costs, divert management’s attention away from other operational matters and expose us to other associated risks. We continually evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses and technologies, and we consider targeted acquisitions that expand our core competencies to be an important part of our future growth strategy.  In the past, we have made acquisitions of other businesses with synergistic products, services and technologies, and plan to continue to do so in the future.  Acquisitions involve numerous risks, which include but are not limited to:  ●difficulties and increased costs in connection with the integration of the personnel, operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies into our existing facilities and operations; ●diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters; ●failure to commercialize the acquired technology; ●the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies; ●lack of synergy, or inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisitions; ●the risk that the issuance of our common stock, if any, in an acquisition or merger could be dilutive to our shareholders; ●the inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies and ●the acquired assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired assets. 13  If demand declines for chemical vapor deposition, gas control and related equipment, or for carbon nanotube and nanowire deposition systems, our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our products are utilized to develop and manufacture materials and coatings for industrial and research applications that are used in numerous markets including but not limited to aerospace, medical, solar, nano and advanced electronic components. A significant part of our growth strategy involves continued expansion of the sales of our products for industrial as well as research and development purposes by companies, universities and government-funded research laboratories. The availability of funds for these purposes may be subject to budgetary and political restrictions, as well as cost-cutting measures by manufacturers in the markets in which we operate. If the availability of funds or the demand for capital equipment in the markets in which we operate declines, the demand for our products would also decline and our financial position and results of operations could be harmed. The conditions of the markets in which we operate are volatile. The demand for our products and the profitability of our products can change significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors. The industries in which we operate are characterized by ongoing changes, including:  ●the availability of funds for research and development; ●global and regional economic conditions; ●governmental budgetary and political constraints; ●changes in the capacity utilization and production volume for research and industrial applications in the markets in which we operate; ●the profitability and capital resources of manufacturers in the markets in which we operate; and ●changes in technology. For these and other reasons, our results of operations for past periods may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results. Volatile and cyclical demand for our products may make it difficult for us to accurately budget our expense levels, which are based in part on our projections of future revenues. Demand for our equipment and related consumable products may be volatile as a result of sudden changes in supply and demand, and other factors in the manufacturing process. Our orders tend to be more volatile than our revenue, as any change in demand is reflected immediately in orders booked, which are net of cancellations, while revenue, tends to be recognized over multiple quarters as a result of procurement and production lead times, and the deferral of certain revenue under our revenue recognition policies. The fiscal period in which we are able to recognize revenue is also at times subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment. This could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate. 14  When cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results may be materially adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary for us to remain competitive and financially sound. During a down cycle, we must be able to make timely adjustments to our cost and expense structure to correspond to the prevailing market conditions. In addition, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and the number of our personnel to meet customer demand, which may require additional liquidity. We can provide no assurance, that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to changes within the industry cycles in which we operate. If we fail to respond to these cyclical changes, our business could be seriously harmed. We do not have long-term volume production contracts with our customers, and we do not control the timing or volume of orders placed by our customers. Whether and to what extent our customers place orders for any specific products, and the mix and quantities of products included in those orders are factors beyond our control. Insufficient orders would result in under-utilization of our manufacturing facilities and infrastructure, and will negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. We face significant competition and we are relatively small in size and have fewer resources in comparison with many of our competitors. We face significant competition throughout the world, which may increase as certain markets in which we operate continue to evolve. Our future performance depends, in part, upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide. Some of our competitors are diversified companies that have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive research, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we can provide. We face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products, some of which compete with the products and services that we offer, as well as companies, universities and research laboratories that have the capacity to design and build their own equipment internally. These competitors may bundle their products and services in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products. In addition, we face competition from smaller emerging processing equipment companies, whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer at often lower prices than ours, using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets. Loss of competitive position could impair our prices, customer orders, revenue, gross margin and market share, any of which would negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. Our failure to compete successfully with these other companies would seriously harm our business. There is a risk that larger, better financed competitors will develop and market more advanced products than those we currently offer, or that competitors with greater financial resources may decrease prices, thereby putting us under financial pressure. The health and environmental effects of nanotechnology are unknown, and this uncertainty could adversely affect the expansion of our business. The health and environmental effects of nanotechnology are unknown. There is no scientific agreement on the health effects of nanomaterials in general and carbon nanotubes, in particular, but some scientists believe that in some cases, nanomaterials may be hazardous to an individual’s health or to the environment. 15  The science of nanotechnology is based on arranging atoms in such a way as to modify or build materials not made in nature; therefore, the effects are unknown. Future research into the effects of nanomaterials in general, and carbon nanotubes in particular, on health and environmental issues, may have an adverse effect on products incorporating nanotechnology. Since part of our growth strategy is based on sales of research equipment for the production of carbon nanotubes and the sale of such materials, the determination that these materials are harmful could adversely affect the expansion of our business. We may experience increasing price pressure. Our historical business strategy for many of our products has focused on product performance and customer service rather than on price. As a result of budgetary constraints, many of our customers are extremely price sensitive when purchasing of capital equipment. If we are unable to obtain prices that allow us to continue to compete on the basis of product performance and customer service, our profit margins will be reduced. We may not be able to keep pace with the rapid change in the technology we use in our products. We believe that our continued success in the markets in which we operate depends, in part, on our ability to continually improve existing technologies and to develop and manufacture new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. We must be able to introduce these products and product enhancements into the market in a timely manner, in response to customer’s demands for higher-performance research and assembly equipment, customized to address rapid technological advances in capital equipment designs. Technological innovations are inherently complex, and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing. Our future business success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products, or new uses for existing products, that successfully address changing customer needs. Our success also depends on our ability to achieve market acceptance of our new products. In order to maintain our success in the marketplace, we may have to substantially increase our expenditures on research and development. If we do not develop and introduce new products, technologies or uses for existing products in a timely manner and continually find ways to reduce the cost of developing and producing them in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, our business could be seriously harmed. Manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect our ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs, while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory. Our business depends on timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of our customers. Some key parts to our products are subject to long lead-times and/or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers. Cyclical industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for us and for companies throughout our supply chain. Further, these conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations. 16  We may also experience significant interruptions of our manufacturing operations, delays in our ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:  ●The failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis; ●Volatility in the availability and cost of materials, including rare earth elements; ●Difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals; ●Information technology or infrastructure failures; and ●Natural disasters or other events beyond our control (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war). If a supplier fails to meet our requirements concerning quality, cost, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, we may transfer our business to alternative sources, which could entail manufacturing delays, additional costs, or other difficulties. In addition, if we need to rapidly increase our business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may exacerbate any interruptions in our manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on our working capital. If any of our customers cancel or fail to accept a large system order, our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our backlog, largely consists of orders for customized systems including our chemical vapor deposition equipment and annealing and diffusion furnaces which are built to client specifications. We also have a significant concentration of revenue in a single customer. In 2018, our largest customer accounted for 38.2% of our revenue as compared to 66.1% in 2017. These customized systems can have prices that range from $100,000 to several million dollars, depending on the configuration, specific options included and any special requirements of the customer.  Because our orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer, our backlog at any particular point in time is not necessarily representative of actual sales for succeeding periods, nor does our backlog provide any assurance of achievement of revenues or that we will realize a profit from completing these orders.  Our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected should any large system order be cancelled prior to shipment, or not be accepted by the customer due to alleged non-conformity with product specifications or otherwise. Likewise, a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of our customers that purchase large systems, could have a material impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results.  Our backlog does not provide any assurance that we will realize a profit from those orders, or indicate in which period revenue will be recognized. 17  We may not be able to hire or retain the number of qualified personnel, particularly engineering personnel, required for our business, which would harm the development and sales of our products and limit our ability to grow.  Competition in our industry for senior management, technical, sales, marketing and other key personnel is intense. If we are unable to retain our existing personnel, or attract and train additional qualified personnel, our growth may be limited due to a lack of capacity to develop and market our products. In particular, we have, from time to time, experienced difficulty in hiring and retaining skilled engineers with appropriate qualifications to support our growth strategy. Our success depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified engineering personnel with experience in equipment design. Specifically, we need to continue to attract and retain mechanical, electrical, software and field service engineers to work with our direct sales force to technically qualify and perform on new sales opportunities and orders, and to demonstrate our products. Our financial position and results of operations may be materially harmed if we are unable to recoup our investment in research and development. The rapid change in technology in our industry requires that we continue to make substantial investments in research and development and selective acquisitions of technologies and products, in order to enhance the performance and functionality of our product line, to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands for improved performance, features and functionality.  These efforts include those related to the development of technology for the commercialization of carbon nanotubes. There can be no assurance that revenue from future products or enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products, enhancements or acquisitions, or that we will be able to secure the financial resources necessary to fund future research and development or acquisitions.  Research and development costs are typically incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a product, and not all development activities result in commercially viable products.  In addition, we cannot ensure that products or enhancements will receive market acceptance, or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us.  Our business could be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices, or if our products are not accepted by the markets in which we operate. We have made investments in our proprietary technologies. If third parties violate our proprietary rights, or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietary rights, such events could result in a loss of value of some of our intellectual property or costly litigation. Our success is dependent in part on our technologies and our other proprietary rights.  We believe that while patents can be useful and may be utilized by us in the future, they are not always necessary or feasible to protect our intellectual property. The process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive, and we cannot be certain that applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us.  In addition to patent protection, we have also historically protected our proprietary information and intellectual property such as design specifications, blueprints, technical processes and employee know-how, by limiting access to this confidential information and trade secrets and through the use of non-disclosure agreements. Other companies and individuals, including our larger competitors, may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology, or design around the intellectual property that we own or license.  Our failure to adequately protect our intellectual property, could result in the reduction or extinguishment of our rights to such intellectual property. We also assert rights to certain trademarks relating to certain of our products and product lines. We have not filed trademark applications to protect such marks with any governmental agency, including, but not limited to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation, but we have not filed any copyright applications with the U.S. Copyright Office in connection with those works.  As a result, we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties.  18  While patent, copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property may be important, we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel.  We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through other internal security measures.  However, these employees, consultants and third parties may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing.  In addition, the laws of certain territories in which we sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Occasionally, we may receive communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights or other intellectual property rights that they believe cover certain of our products, processes, technologies or information.  If such cases arise, we will evaluate our position and consider the available alternatives, which may include seeking licenses to use the technology in question on commercially reasonable terms, or defending our position.  Nevertheless, we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain licenses, or, if we are able to obtain licenses, that related terms will be acceptable, or that litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur.  Defending our intellectual property rights through litigation could be very costly.  If we are not able to negotiate the necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or successfully defend our position, our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our reputation and operating performance may be negatively affected if our products are not timely delivered. We provide complex products that often require substantial lead-time for design, ordering parts and materials, and for assembly and installation. The time required to design, order parts and materials and to manufacture, assemble and install our products, may in turn lead to delays or shortages in the availability of some products. If a product is delayed or is the subject of shortage because of problems with our ability to design, manufacture or assemble the product on a timely basis, or if a product or software otherwise fails to meet performance criteria, we may lose revenue opportunities entirely, or experience delays in revenue recognition associated with a product or service. In addition, we may incur higher operating expenses during the period required to correct the problem. 19  We need to manage our growth effectively or we may experience difficulty in filling customer orders, declining product quality, increased costs or other operating challenges. We anticipate that continued growth of our operations will be required to satisfy our projected increase in demand for our products and to avail ourselves of new market opportunities. The expanding scope of our business and the growth in the number of our employees, customers and products have placed and will continue to place a significant strain on our management, information technology systems, manufacturing facilities and other resources. To properly manage our growth, we may need to hire additional employees, upgrade our existing financial and reporting systems and improve our business processes and controls. We may also be required to expand our manufacturing facilities or add new manufacturing facilities. Failure to effectively manage our growth could make it difficult to manufacture our products and fill orders, as well as lead to declines in product quality or increased costs; any of these would adversely impact our business and results of operations. Historically, we have only manufactured in unit or small batch quantities. If we receive orders for a large number of our systems, we may not have the internal manufacturing capacity to fill these orders on a timely basis, if at all, and may be forced to subcontract or outsource some of the fabrication of these systems to third parties. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully subcontract or outsource the fabrication of our systems at a reasonable cost to us, or that such third parties will adhere to our quality control standards. Our business might be adversely affected by our dependence on foreign business. During the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately $2.4 million or 9.9% of our revenues were generated by sales to customers outside the U.S. compared to approximately $3.9 million or 9.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Because a portion of our revenues are derived from international customers, our operating results could be negatively affected by a decline in the economies of any of the countries or regions in which we do business.  Each region can exhibit unique characteristics, which can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period.  Periodic local or international economic downturns, trade balance issues and political instability, as well as fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates, could negatively affect our business and results of operations. All of our sales to date have been primarily priced in U.S. dollars. While our business has not been materially affected in the past by currency fluctuations, there is a risk that it may be materially adversely affected in the future.  Such risks include possible losses due to both currency exchange rate fluctuations and from possible social and political instability.  20  If our critical suppliers fail to deliver sufficient quantities of quality materials and components in a timely and cost-effective manner, it could negatively affect our business. We do not manufacture many components used in the production of our products, and consequently, we use numerous unrelated suppliers of materials and components.  We generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers.  Because of the variability and uniqueness of our customer’s orders, we try to avoid maintaining an extensive inventory of materials and components for manufacturing. While we are not dependent on any principal or major supplier for most of our material and component needs, switching over to an alternative supplier may take significant amounts of time and added expense, which could result in a disruption of our operations and adversely affect our business. It is not always practical or even possible to ensure that component parts are available from multiple suppliers; accordingly, we procure some key parts from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers.  At certain times, increases in demand for capital equipment can result in longer lead-times for many important system components, which may cause delays in meeting shipments to our customers.  The delay in the shipment of even a few systems could cause significant variations in our quarterly revenue, operating results and the market value of our common stock.  We cannot assure you that our financial position and results of operations will not be materially and adversely affected if, in the future, we do not receive in a timely and cost-effective manner a sufficient quantity of quality component parts and materials to meet our production requirements. We might require additional financing to expand our operations. Although we recently purchased an additional facility, we could require additional financing to support our investment in our CVD Materials segment and to further implement our overall growth plans.  If any additional financing is not available if and when required on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or, even if available and we issue additional common stock, it may materially dilute the ownership interests of the then existing shareholders. We may be required to take additional impairment charges on assets. We are required to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment, or on an interim basis, whenever certain events occur or circumstances change, such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount. We are also required to test our long-lived assets, including acquired intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, for recoverability and impairment whenever there are indicators or impairment, such as an adverse change in business climate. As part of our long-term strategy, we have pursued acquisitions of other companies or assets, such as our recent acquisitions of assets owned by Tantaline ApS and MesoScribe Technologies, Inc. and may pursue future acquisitions of other companies or assets which could potentially increase our assets. Adverse changes in business conditions could materially impact our estimates of future operations and result in impairment charges to these assets. If our assets were impaired, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 21  The price of our common shares is volatile and could decline significantly. The stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular has experienced volatility. If those industry-based market fluctuations continue, the trading price of our common shares could decline significantly independent of the overall market, and shareholders could lose all or a substantial part of their investment. The market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors, including, among others:  ●difficult macroeconomic conditions, unfavorable geopolitical events, and general stock market uncertainties, such as those occasioned by a global liquidity crisis and a failure of large financial institutions; ●receipt of large orders or cancellations of orders for our products; ●issues associated with the performance and reliability of our products; ●actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations; ●announcements of financial developments or technological innovations; ●changes in recommendations and/or financial estimates by investment research analysis; ●strategic transactions, such as acquisitions, divestitures, or spin-offs; and ●the occurrence of major catastrophic events ●trading volume is low Significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to our publicly traded securities and technology companies generally. The price of our common shares is likely to be volatile in the future. In the past, securities class action litigation often has been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. If similar litigation were pursued against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. We face the risk of product liability claims.  The manufacture and sale of our products, which in operation sometimes involve the use of toxic materials and extreme temperatures, and could result in product liability claims.  For example, our rapid thermal processing systems used to heat semiconductor materials to temperatures in excess of 1000º Celsius have certain inherent risks.  A failure of our product(s) at a customer site could also result in losses due to interruption of the business operations of our customer. While we regularly evaluate the nature and limits of our insurance coverages, there can be no assurance that our existing policies of insurance will be adequate to protect us from all liabilities that we might incur in connection with the manufacture and sale of our products in the event of a successful product liability claim or series of successful claims against us. 22  We are subject to environmental regulations, and our inability or failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business. We are subject to environmental regulations in connection with our business operations, including regulations related to the development and manufacture of our products and our customers’ use of our products. Our failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental regulations could result in significant remediation liabilities, the imposition of fines or the suspension or termination of development, manufacturing or use of certain of our products, or affect the operation of our facilities, use or value of our real property, each of which could damage our financial position and results of operations. If we are subject to cyber-attacks we could incur substantial costs and, if such attacks are successful, we could incur significant liabilities, reputational harm, and disruption to our operations. We manage, store and transmit proprietary information and sensitive data relating to our operations. We may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use for these purposes. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate and/or compromise our confidential information (and or third-party confidential information), create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or our products, or that otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. The costs to address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers, impeding our sales, manufacturing, distribution, or other critical functions. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive data about us, our customer, or other third parties, could expose us, our customers, or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business. Regulations related to conflict minerals will force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chains more complex, and may result in damage to our relationships with customers. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted requirements for companies that manufacture products that contain certain minerals and metals known as “conflict minerals”. These rules require public companies to perform diligence and to report annually to the SEC whether such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of minerals we use in the manufacture of our products. In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products. Given the complexity of our supply chain, we may not be able to ascertain the origins of these minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as conflict mineral free, which could harm our relationships with these customers and lead to a loss of revenue. These requirements could limit the pool of suppliers that can provide conflict-free minerals, and we may be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at competitive prices, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability. 23  Failure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have agreements with third parties and make sales in countries known to experience corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices. We can make no assurance, however, that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. "
6,CVV,CVD EQUIPMENT CORP,2018-04-02,"     Risk Factors
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our shareholders should carefully consider the risk factors described below. The risks set forth below may not be the only risk factors relating to the Company. Any of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and stock price. 10  If demand declines for chemical vapor deposition, gas control and related equipment, or for carbon nanotube and nanowire deposition systems, our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our products are utilized to develop and manufacture materials and coatings for industrial and research applications that are used in numerous markets including but not limited to aerospace, medical, solar, nano and advanced electronic components. A significant part of our growth strategy involves continued expansion of the sales of our products for industrial as well as research and development purposes by companies, universities and government-funded research laboratories. The availability of funds for these purposes may be subject to budgetary and political restrictions, as well as cost-cutting measures by manufacturers in the markets in which we operate. If the availability of funds or the demand for capital equipment in the markets in which we operate declines, the demand for our products would also decline and our financial position and results of operations could be harmed. We have a highly concentrated customer base so that changes in ordering patterns, delays or order cancellations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  In fiscal 2017, approximately 66.0% of our net sales was accounted for by one customer. We expect that contracts or orders from a relatively limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our business. The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. If any of our significant customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, we may not be able to replace the business in a timely manner or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Major customers may also seek, and on occasion receive, pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to us and can hurt our competitive position.  The conditions of the markets in which we operate are volatile. The demand for our products and the profitability of our products can change significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors. The industries in which we operate are characterized by ongoing changes, including:  ●the availability of funds for research and development; ●global and regional economic conditions; ●governmental budgetary and political constraints; ●changes in the capacity utilization and production volume for research and industrial applications in the markets in which we operate; ●the profitability and capital resources of manufacturers in the markets in which we operate; and ●changes in technology. 11  For these and other reasons, our results of operations for past periods may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results. Volatile and cyclical demand for our products may make it difficult for us to accurately budget our expense levels, which are based in part on our projections of future revenues. Demand for our equipment and related consumable products may be volatile as a result of sudden changes in supply and demand, and other factors in the manufacturing process. Our orders tend to be more volatile than our revenue, as any change in demand is reflected immediately in orders booked, which are net of cancellations, while revenue, tends to be recognized over multiple quarters as a result of procurement and production lead times, and the deferral of certain revenue under our revenue recognition policies. The fiscal period in which we are able to recognize revenue is also at times subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment. This could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate. When cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results may be materially adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in for us to remain competitive and financially sound. During a down cycle, we must be able to make timely adjustments to our cost and expense structure to correspond to the prevailing market conditions. In addition, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and the number of our personnel to meet customer demand, which may require additional liquidity. We can provide no assurance, that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to changes within the industry cycles in which we operate. If we fail to respond to these cyclical change, our business could be seriously harmed. We do not have long-term volume production contracts with our customers, and we do not control the timing or volume of orders placed by our customers. Whether and to what extent our customers place orders for any specific products, and the mix and quantities of products included in those orders are factors beyond our control. Insufficient orders would result in under-utilization of our manufacturing facilities and infrastructure, and will negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. We face significant competition and we are relatively small in size and have fewer resources in comparison with many of our competitors. We face significant competition throughout the world, which may increase as certain markets in which we operate continue to evolve. Our future performance depends, in part, upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide. Some of our competitors are diversified companies that have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive research, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we can provide. We face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products, some of which compete with the products and services that we offer, as well as companies, universities and research laboratories that have the capacity to design and build their own equipment internally. These competitors may bundle their products and services in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products. In addition, we face competition from smaller emerging processing equipment companies, whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer at often lower prices than ours, using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets. Loss of competitive position could impair our prices, customer orders, revenue, gross margin and market share, any of which would negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. Our failure to compete successfully with these other companies would seriously harm our business. There is a risk that larger, better financed competitors will develop and market more advanced products than those we currently offer, or that competitors with greater financial resources may decrease prices, thereby putting us under financial pressure. 12  The health and environmental effects of nanotechnology are unknown, and this uncertainty could adversely affect the expansion of our business. The health and environmental effects of nanotechnology are unknown. There is no scientific agreement on the health effects of nanomaterials in general and carbon nanotubes, in particular, but some scientists believe that in some cases, nanomaterials may be hazardous to an individual’s health or to the environment. The science of nanotechnology is based on arranging atoms in such a way as to modify or build materials not made in nature; therefore, the effects are unknown. Future research into the effects of nanomaterials in general, and carbon nanotubes in particular, on health and environmental issues, may have an adverse effect on products incorporating nanotechnology. Since part of our growth strategy is based on sales of research equipment for the production of carbon nanotubes and the sale of such materials, the determination that these materials are harmful could adversely affect the expansion of our business. We may experience increasing price pressure. Our historical business strategy for many of our products has focused on product performance and customer service rather than on price. As a result of budgetary constraints, many of our customers are extremely price sensitive when purchasing of capital equipment. If we are unable to obtain prices that allow us to continue to compete on the basis of product performance and customer service, our profit margins will be reduced. We may not be able to keep pace with the rapid change in the technology we use in our products. We believe that our continued success in the markets in which we operate depends, in part, on our ability to continually improve existing technologies and to develop and manufacture new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. We must be able to introduce these products and product enhancements into the market in a timely manner, in response to customer’s demands for higher-performance research and assembly equipment, customized to address rapid technological advances in capital equipment designs. Technological innovations are inherently complex, and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing. Our future business success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products, or new uses for existing products, that successfully address changing customer needs. Our success also depends on our ability to achieve market acceptance of our new products. In order to maintain our success in the marketplace, we may have to substantially increase our expenditures on research and development. If we do not develop and introduce new products, technologies or uses for existing products in a timely manner and continually find ways to reduce the cost of developing and producing them in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, our business could be seriously harmed. 13  Manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect our ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs, while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory. Our business depends on timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of our customers. Some key parts to our products are subject to long lead-times and/or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers. Cyclical industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for us and for companies throughout our supply chain. Further, these conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations. We may also experience significant interruptions of our manufacturing operations, delays in our ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:  ●The failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis; ●Volatility in the availability and cost of materials, including rare earth elements; ●Difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals; ●Information technology or infrastructure failures; and ●Natural disasters or other events beyond our control (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war). If a supplier fails to meet our requirements concerning quality, cost, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, we may transfer our business to alternative sources, which could entail manufacturing delays, additional costs, or other difficulties. In addition, if we need to rapidly increase our business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may exacerbate any interruptions in our manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on our working capital. If any of our customers cancel or fail to accept a large system order, our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our backlog, largely consists of orders for customized systems including our chemical vapor deposition equipment and annealing and diffusion furnaces which are built to client specifications. We also have a significant concentration of revenue in a single customer. In 2017, our largest customer accounted for 66.1% of our revenue. These customized systems can have prices that range from $100,000 to several million dollars, depending on the configuration, specific options included and any special requirements of the customer.  Because our orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer, our backlog at any particular point in time is not necessarily representative of actual sales for succeeding periods, nor does our backlog provide any assurance of achievement of revenues or that we will realize a profit from completing these orders.  Since revenues on long-term contracts are recognized by the percentage-of-completion method, if a contract is canceled, we may have to reverse revenue at such time. Our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected should any large system order be cancelled prior to shipment, or not be accepted by the customer due to alleged non-conformity with product specifications or otherwise. Likewise, a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of our customers that purchase large systems, could have a material impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results.  Our backlog does not provide any assurance that we will realize a profit from those orders, or indicate in which period revenue will be recognized. 14  Our success is highly dependent on the technical, sales, marketing and managerial contributions of key individuals, including Leonard A. Rosenbaum, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President, and we may be unable to retain these individuals or recruit others. We depend on our senior executives, including Leonard A. Rosenbaum, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President, and certain key managers as well as, engineering, research and development, sales, marketing and manufacturing personnel, who are critical to our business. We do not have long-term employment agreements with our key employees. We presently have a key person life insurance policies on the life of Leonard A. Rosenbaum, for a total insured amount of $5 million, which may not be sufficient to cover our loss of Mr. Rosenbaum’s services. Furthermore, larger competitors may be able to offer more generous compensation packages to our executives and key employees, and therefore we risk losing key personnel to those competitors. If we were to lose the services of any of our key personnel, our engineering, product development, manufacturing and sales efforts could be slowed. We may also incur increased operating expenses, and be required to divert the attention of our senior executives to search for their replacements. The integration of any new personnel could disrupt our ongoing operations.  We may not be able to hire or retain the number of qualified personnel, particularly engineering personnel, required for our business, which would harm the development and sales of our products and limit our ability to grow.  Competition in our industry for senior management, technical, sales, marketing and other key personnel is intense. If we are unable to retain our existing personnel, or attract and train additional qualified personnel, our growth may be limited due to a lack of capacity to develop and market our products. In particular, we have, from time to time, experienced difficulty in hiring and retaining skilled engineers with appropriate qualifications to support our growth strategy. Our success depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified engineering personnel with experience in equipment design. Specifically, we need to continue to attract and retain mechanical, electrical, software and field service engineers to work with our direct sales force to technically qualify and perform on new sales opportunities and orders, and to demonstrate our products. 15  The substantial lead-time required for ordering parts and materials may lead to inventory problems. The lead-time for ordering parts and materials for some of our products can be several months. As a result, we must order some components based on forecasted demand. If demand for our products lags significantly behind our forecasts, we may order more components than we require, which would result in cash flow problems as well as excess or obsolete inventory. Acquisitions can result in an increase in our operating costs, divert management’s attention away from other operational matters and expose us to other associated risks. In December 2016, we purchased certain assets formally owned by Tantaline A/S, which we incorporated into a facility in Denmark which is operated by our subsidiary, Tantaline CVD ApS. On October 31, 2017, through our newly formed and wholly-owned subsidiary, CVD Mesoscribe Technologies Corporation (“MesoScribe Technologies”), we acquired substantially all of the operating assets and business of Mesoscribe Technologies, Inc. (“MTI”).  We continually evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses and technologies, and we consider targeted acquisitions that expand our core competencies to be an important part of our future growth strategy.  In the past, we have made acquisitions of other businesses with synergistic products, services and technologies, and plan to continue to do so in the future.   Acquisitions involve numerous risks, which include but are not limited to:  ●difficulties and increased costs in connection with the integration of the personnel, operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies into our existing facilities and operations; ●diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters; ●failure to commercialize the acquired technology; ●the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies ●lack of synergy, or inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisitions; ●the risk that the issuance of our common stock, if any, in an acquisition or merger could be dilutive to our shareholders; ●the inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies; ●the acquired assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired assets. 16  Our financial position and results of operations may be materially harmed if we are unable to recoup our investment in research and development. The rapid change in technology in our industry requires that we continue to make substantial investments in research and development and selective acquisitions of technologies and products, in order to enhance the performance and functionality of our product line, to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands for improved performance, features and functionality.  These efforts include those related to the development of technology for the commercialization of carbon nanotubes. There can be no assurance that revenue from future products or enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products, enhancements or acquisitions, or that we will be able to secure the financial resources necessary to fund future research and development or acquisitions.  Research and development costs are typically incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a product, and not all development activities result in commercially viable products.  In addition, we cannot ensure that products or enhancements will receive market acceptance, or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us.  Our business could be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices, or if our products are not accepted by the markets in which we operate. We have made investments in our proprietary technologies. If third parties violate our proprietary rights, or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietary rights, such events could result in a loss of value of some of our intellectual property or costly litigation. Our success is dependent in part on our technologies and our other proprietary rights.  We believe that while patents can be useful and may be utilized by us in the future, they are not always necessary or feasible to protect our intellectual property. The process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive, and we cannot be certain that applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us.  In addition to patent protection, we have also historically protected our proprietary information and intellectual property such as design specifications, blueprints, technical processes and employee know-how, by limiting access to this confidential information and trade secrets and through the use of non-disclosure agreements. Other companies and individuals, including our larger competitors, may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology, or design around the intellectual property that we own or license.  Our failure to adequately protect our intellectual property, could result in the reduction or extinguishment of our rights to such intellectual property. We also assert rights to certain trademarks relating to certain of our products and product lines. We have not filed trademark applications to protect such marks with any governmental agency, including, but not limited to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation, but we have not filed any copyright applications with the U.S. Copyright Office in connection with those works.  As a result, we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties.   While patent, copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property may be important, we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel.  We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through other internal security measures.  However, these employees, consultants and third parties may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing.  In addition, the laws of certain territories in which we sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. 17  Occasionally, we may receive communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights or other intellectual property rights that they believe cover certain of our products, processes, technologies or information.  If such cases arise, we will evaluate our position and consider the available alternatives, which may include seeking licenses to use the technology in question on commercially reasonable terms, or defending our position.  Nevertheless, we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain licenses, or, if we are able to obtain licenses, that related terms will be acceptable, or that litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur.  Defending our intellectual property rights through litigation could be very costly.  If we are not able to negotiate the necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or successfully defend our position, our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our reputation and operating performance may be negatively affected if our products are not timely delivered. We provide complex products that often require substantial lead-time for design, ordering parts and materials, and for assembly and installation. The time required to design, order parts and materials and to manufacture, assemble and install our products, may in turn lead to delays or shortages in the availability of some products. If a product is delayed or is the subject of shortage because of problems with our ability to design, manufacture or assemble the product on a timely basis, or if a product or software otherwise fails to meet performance criteria, we may lose revenue opportunities entirely, or experience delays in revenue recognition associated with a product or service. In addition, we may incur higher operating expenses during the period required to correct the problem. Our lengthy and variable sales cycle may make it difficult to predict our financial results. The marketing, sale and manufacture of our products, often requires a lengthy sales cycle ranging from several months to over one year before we can complete production and delivery. The lengthy sales cycle makes forecasting the volume and timing of sales difficult, and raises additional risks that customers may cancel or decide not to enter into contracts. The length of the sales cycle depends on the size and complexity of the project, the customer’s in-depth evaluation of our products, and, in some cases, the protracted nature of a bidding process. Because a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed, we may incur substantial expense before we earn associated revenue. If customer cancellations occur, they could result in the loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our operating expenses. We need to manage our growth effectively or we may experience difficulty in filling customer orders, declining product quality, increased costs or other operating challenges. We anticipate that continued growth of our operations will be required to satisfy our projected increase in demand for our products and to avail ourselves of new market opportunities. The expanding scope of our business and the growth in the number of our employees, customers and products have placed and will continue to place a significant strain on our management, information technology systems, manufacturing facilities and other resources. To properly manage our growth, we may need to hire additional employees, upgrade our existing financial and reporting systems and improve our business processes and controls. We may also be required to expand our manufacturing facilities or add new manufacturing facilities. Failure to effectively manage our growth could make it difficult to manufacture our products and fill orders, as well as lead to declines in product quality or increased costs; any of these would adversely impact our business and results of operations. 18  Historically, we have only manufactured in unit or small batch quantities. If we receive orders for a large number of our systems, we may not have the internal manufacturing capacity to fill these orders on a timely basis, if at all, and may be forced to subcontract or outsource some of the fabrication of these systems to third parties. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully subcontract or outsource the fabrication of our systems at a reasonable cost to us, or that such third parties will adhere to our quality control standards. Our business might be adversely affected by our dependence on foreign business. During the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately $3.0 million or 9.6% of our revenues were generated by sales to customers outside the U.S. compared to approximately $2.4 million or 11.9% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Because a portion of our revenues are derived from international customers, our operating results could be negatively affected by a decline in the economies of any of the countries or regions in which we do business.  Each region can exhibit unique characteristics, which can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period.  Periodic local or international economic downturns, trade balance issues and political instability, as well as fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates, could negatively affect our business and results of operations. All of our sales to date have been primarily priced in U.S. dollars. While our business has not been materially affected in the past by currency fluctuations, there is a risk that it may be materially adversely affected in the future.  Such risks include possible losses due to both currency exchange rate fluctuations and from possible social and political instability.   Failure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have agreements with third parties and make sales in countries known to experience corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices. We can make no assurance, however, that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 19  If our critical suppliers fail to deliver sufficient quantities of quality materials and components in a timely and cost-effective manner, it could negatively affect our business. We do not manufacture many components used in the production of our products, and consequently, we use numerous unrelated suppliers of materials and components.  We generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers.  Because of the variability and uniqueness of our customer’s orders, we try to avoid maintaining an extensive inventory of materials and components for manufacturing. While we are not dependent on any principal or major supplier for most of our material and component needs, switching over to an alternative supplier may take significant amounts of time and added expense, which could result in a disruption of our operations and adversely affect our business.  It is not always practical or even possible to ensure that component parts are available from multiple suppliers; accordingly, we procure some key parts from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers.  At certain times, increases in demand for capital equipment can result in longer lead-times for many important system components, which may cause delays in meeting shipments to our customers.  The delay in the shipment of even a few systems could cause significant variations in our quarterly revenue, operating results and the market value of our common stock.  We cannot assure you that our financial position and results of operations will not be materially and adversely affected if, in the future, we do not receive in a timely and cost-effective manner a sufficient quantity of quality component parts and materials to meet our production requirements. We might require additional financing to expand our operations. Although we recently purchased additional space, we may require additional financing to further implement our growth plans.  We cannot assure you any additional financing will be available if and when required on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or, even if available, that it would not materially dilute the ownership interests of the then existing shareholders. 20  We may be required to take additional impairment charges on assets. We are required to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment, or on an interim basis, whenever certain events occur or circumstances change, such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount. We are also required to test our long-lived assets, including acquired intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, for recoverability and impairment whenever there are indicators or impairment, such as an adverse change in business climate. As part of our long-term strategy, we have pursued acquisitions of other companies or assets, such as our recent acquisitions of assets owned by Tantaline ApS and Mesoscribe Technologies, Inc. and may pursue future acquisitions of other companies or assets which could potentially increase our assets. Adverse changes in business conditions could materially impact our estimates of future operations and result in impairment charges to these assets. If our assets were impaired, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The price of our common shares is volatile and could decline significantly. The stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular has experienced volatility. If those industry-based market fluctuations continue, the trading price of our common shares could decline significantly independent of the overall market, and shareholders could lose all or a substantial part of their investment. The market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors, including, among others:  ●difficult macroeconomic conditions, unfavorable geopolitical events, and general stock market uncertainties, such as those occasioned by a global liquidity crises and a failure of large financial institutions; ●receipt of large orders or cancellations of orders for our products; ●issues associated with the performance and reliability of our products; ●actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations; ●announcements of financial developments or technological innovations; ●changes in recommendations and/or financial estimates by investment research analysis; ●strategic transactions, such as acquisitions, divestitures, or spin-offs; and ●the occurrence of major catastrophic events ● Significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to our publicly traded securities and technology companies generally. The price of our common shares is likely to be volatile in the future. In the past, securities class action litigation often has been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. If similar litigation were pursued against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 21  We face the risk of product liability claims.  The manufacture and sale of our products, which in operation may involve the use of toxic materials and extreme temperatures, involve the risk of product liability claims. For example, our rapid thermal processing systems are used to heat semiconductor materials to temperatures in excess of 1000º Celsius. In addition, a failure of one of our products at a customer site could interrupt the business operations of our customer. Our existing insurance coverage limits may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities that we might incur in connection with the manufacture and sale of our products if a successful product liability claim or series of product liability claims were brought against us. We are subject to environmental regulations, and our inability or failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business. We are subject to environmental regulations in connection with our business operations, including regulations related to the development and manufacture of our products and our customers’ use of our products. Our failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental regulations could result in significant remediation liabilities, the imposition of fines or the suspension or termination of development, manufacturing or use of certain of our products, or affect the operation of our facilities, use or value of our real property, each of which could damage our financial position and results of operations. If we are subject to cyber-attacks we could incur substantial costs and, if such attacks are successful, we could incur significant liabilities, reputational harm, and disruption to our operations. We manage, store and transmit proprietary information and sensitive data relating to our operations. We may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use for these purposes. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate and/or compromise our confidential information (and or third party confidential information), create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or our products, or that otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. The costs to address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers, impeding our sales, manufacturing, distribution, or other critical functions. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive data about us, our customer, or other third parties, could expose us, our customers, or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business. 22  Regulations related to conflict minerals will force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chains more complex, and may result in damage to our relationships with customers. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted requirements for companies that manufacture products that contain certain minerals and metals known as “conflict minerals”. These rules require public companies to perform diligence and to report annually to the SEC whether such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of minerals we use in the manufacture of our products. In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products. Given the complexity of our supply chain, we may not be able to ascertain the origins of these minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as conflict mineral free, which could harm our relationships with these customers and lead to a loss of revenue. These requirements could limit the pool of suppliers that can provide conflict-free minerals, and we may be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at competitive prices, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability. "
4,CVV,CVD EQUIPMENT CORP,2017-03-30,"     Risk Factors
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our shareholders should carefully consider the risk factors described below. The risks set forth below may not be the only risk factors relating to the company. Any of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and stock price. If demand declines for chemical vapor deposition, gas control and related equipment, or for carbon nanotube and nanowire deposition systems, our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  8  Our products are utilized to develop and manufacture materials and coatings for industrial and research applications that are used in numerous markets including but not limited to aerospace, medical, solar, nano and advanced electronic components. A significant part of our growth strategy involves continued expansion of the sales of our products for industrial as well as research and development purposes by companies, universities and government-funded research laboratories. The availability of funds for these purposes may be subject to budgetary and political restrictions, as well as cost-cutting measures by manufacturers in the markets in which we operate. If the availability of funds or the demand for capital equipment in the markets in which we operate declines, the demand for our products would also decline and our financial position and results of operations could be harmed. We face risks associated with selling our products to a highly concentrated customer base.  In fiscal 2016, approximately 53.5% of our net sales was accounted for by 2 customers. We expect that contracts or orders from a relatively limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our business. The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. If any of our significant customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, we may not be able to replace the business in a timely manner or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Major customers may also seek, and on occasion receive, pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to us.  The conditions of the markets in which we operate are volatile. The demand for our products and the profitability of our products can change significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors. The industries in which we operate are characterized by ongoing changes, including:  ●the availability of funds for research and development;  ●global and regional economic conditions;  ●governmental budgetary and political constraints;  ●changes in the capacity utilization and production volume for research and industrial applications in the markets in which we operate;  ●the profitability and capital resources of manufacturers in the markets in which we operate; and  ●changes in technology. For these and other reasons, our results of operations for past periods may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results. Volatile and cyclical demand for our products may make it difficult for us to accurately budget our expense levels, which are based in part on our projections of future revenues. Demand for our equipment and related consumable products may be volatile as a result of sudden changes in supply and demand, and other factors in the manufacturing process. Our orders tend to be more volatile than our revenue, as any change in demand is reflected immediately in orders booked, which are net of cancellations, while revenue, tends to be recognized over multiple quarters as a result of procurement and production lead times, and the deferral of certain revenue under our revenue recognition policies. The fiscal period in which we are able to recognize revenue is also at times subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment. This could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate.  9  When cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in for us to remain competitive and financially sound. During a down cycle, we must be able to make timely adjustments to our cost and expense structure to correspond to the prevailing market conditions. In addition, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and the number of our personnel to meet customer demand, which may require additional liquidity. We can provide no assurance, that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to changes within the industry cycles in which we operate. If we fail to respond to these cyclical change, our business could be seriously harmed. We do not have long-term volume production contracts with our customers, and we do not control the timing or volume of orders placed by our customers. Whether and to what extent our customers place orders for any specific products, and the mix and quantities of products included in those orders are factors beyond our control. Insufficient orders would result in under-utilization of our manufacturing facilities and infrastructure, and will negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.  We face significant competition and we are relatively small in size and have fewer resources in comparison with many of our competitors. We face significant competition throughout the world, which may increase as certain markets in which we operate continue to evolve. Some of our competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than us to develop new products and to support customers worldwide. Our future performance depends, in part, upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide. Some of our competitors are diversified companies that have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive research, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we can provide. We face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products, some of which compete with the products and services that we offer, as well as companies, universities and research laboratories that have the capacity to design and build their own equipment internally. These competitors may bundle their products and services in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products. In addition, we face competition from smaller emerging processing equipment companies, whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer at often lower prices than ours, using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets. Loss of competitive position could impair our prices, customer orders, revenue, gross margin and market share, any of which would negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. Our failure to compete successfully with these other companies would seriously harm our business. There is a risk that larger, better financed competitors will develop and market more advanced products than those we currently offer, or that competitors with greater financial resources may decrease prices, thereby putting us under financial pressure.  10  The health and environmental effects of nanotechnology are unknown, and this uncertainty could adversely affect the expansion of our business. The health and environmental effects of nanotechnology are unknown. There is no scientific agreement on the health effects of nanomaterials in general and carbon nanotubes, in particular, but some scientists believe that in some cases, nanomaterials may be hazardous to an individual’s health or to the environment. The science of nanotechnology is based on arranging atoms in such a way as to modify or build materials not made in nature; therefore, the effects are unknown. Future research into the effects of nanomaterials in general, and carbon nanotubes in particular, on health and environmental issues, may have an adverse effect on products incorporating nanotechnology. Since part of our growth strategy is based on sales of research equipment for the production of carbon nanotubes and the sale of such materials, the determination that these materials are harmful could adversely affect the expansion of our business. We may experience increasing price pressure. Our historical business strategy for many of our products has focused on product performance and customer service rather than on price. As a result of budgetary constraints, many of our customers are extremely price sensitive when purchasing of capital equipment. If we are unable to obtain prices that allow us to continue to compete on the basis of product performance and customer service, our profit margins will be reduced. We may not be able to keep pace with the rapid change in the technology we use in our products. We believe that our continued success in the markets in which we operate depends, in part, on our ability to continually improve existing technologies and to develop and manufacture new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. We must be able to introduce these products and product enhancements into the market in a timely manner, in response to customer’s demands for higher-performance research and assembly equipment, customized to address rapid technological advances in capital equipment designs. Technological innovations are inherently complex, and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing. Our future business success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products, or new uses for existing products, that successfully address changing customer needs. Our success also depends on our ability to achieve market acceptance of our new products. In order to maintain our success in the marketplace, we may have to substantially increase our expenditures on research and development. If we do not develop and introduce new products, technologies or uses for existing products in a timely manner and continually find ways to reduce the cost of developing and producing them in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, our business could be seriously harmed. Manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect our ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs, while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory.  11  Our business depends on timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of our customers. Some key parts to our products are subject to long lead-times and/or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers. Cyclical industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for us and for companies throughout our supply chain. Further, these conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations. We may also experience significant interruptions of our manufacturing operations, delays in our ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:  ●The failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis; ●Volatility in the availability and cost of materials, including rare earth elements; ●Difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals; ●Information technology or infrastructure failures; and ●Natural disasters or other events beyond our control (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war). If a supplier fails to meet our requirements concerning quality, cost, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, we may transfer our business to alternative sources, which could entail manufacturing delays, additional costs, or other difficulties. In addition, if we need to rapidly increase our business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may exacerbate any interruptions in our manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on our working capital.  If any of our customers cancel or fail to accept a large system order, our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our backlog, largely consists of orders for customized systems including our chemical vapor deposition equipment and annealing and diffusion furnaces which are built to client specifications. These customized systems can have prices that range from $100,000 to several million dollars, depending on the configuration, specific options included and any special requirements of the customer.  Because our orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer, our backlog at any particular point in time is not necessarily representative of actual sales for succeeding periods, nor does our backlog provide any assurance of achievement of revenues or that we will realize a profit from completing these orders.  Since revenues on long-term contracts are recognized by the percentage-of-completion method, if a contract is canceled, we may have to reverse revenue at such time. Our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected should any large system order be cancelled prior to shipment, or not be accepted by the customer due to alleged non-conformity with product specifications or otherwise. Likewise, a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of our customers that purchase large systems, could have a material impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results.  Our backlog does not provide any assurance that we will realize a profit from those orders, or indicate in which period revenue will be recognized.  12   Our success is highly dependent on the technical, sales, marketing and managerial contributions of key individuals, including Leonard A. Rosenbaum, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President, and we may be unable to retain these individuals or recruit others. We depend on our senior executives, including Leonard A. Rosenbaum, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President, and certain key managers as well as, engineering, research and development, sales, marketing and manufacturing personnel, who are critical to our business. We do not have long-term employment agreements with our key employees. We presently have a key person life insurance policies on the life of Leonard A. Rosenbaum, for a total insured amount of $5 million, which may not be sufficient to cover our loss of Mr. Rosenbaum’s services. Furthermore, larger competitors may be able to offer more generous compensation packages to our executives and key employees, and therefore we risk losing key personnel to those competitors. If we were to lose the services of any of our key personnel, our engineering, product development, manufacturing and sales efforts could be slowed. We may also incur increased operating expenses, and be required to divert the attention of our senior executives to search for their replacements. The integration of any new personnel could disrupt our ongoing operations.  We may not be able to hire or retain the number of qualified personnel, particularly engineering personnel, required for our business, which would harm the development and sales of our products and limit our ability to grow.  Competition in our industry for senior management, technical, sales, marketing and other key personnel is intense. If we are unable to retain our existing personnel, or attract and train additional qualified personnel, our growth may be limited due to a lack of capacity to develop and market our products.  In particular, we have, from time to time, experienced difficulty in hiring and retaining skilled engineers with appropriate qualifications to support our growth strategy. Our success depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified engineering personnel with experience in equipment design. Specifically, we need to continue to attract and retain mechanical, electrical, software and field service engineers to work with our direct sales force to technically qualify and perform on new sales opportunities and orders, and to demonstrate our products. The substantial lead-time required for ordering parts and materials may lead to inventory problems. The lead-time for ordering parts and materials for some of our products can be several months. As a result, we must order some components based on forecasted demand. If demand for our products lags significantly behind our forecasts, we may order more components than we require, which would result in cash flow problems as well as excess or obsolete inventory.  13  Acquisitions can result in an increase in our operating costs, divert management’s attention away from other operational matters and expose us to other associated risks. In December 2016, we purchased certain assets formally owned by Tantaline A/S, which we incorporated into a facility in Denmark which is operated by our subsidiary, Tnataline CVD ApS. We continually evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses and technologies, and we consider targeted acquisitions that expand our core competencies to be an important part of our future growth strategy.  In the past, we have made acquisitions of other businesses with synergistic products, services and technologies, and plan to continue to do so in the future.  Acquisitions involve numerous risks, which include but are not limited to:  ●difficulties and increased costs in connection with the integration of the personnel, operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies into our existing facilities and operations; ●diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters; ●failure to commercialize the acquired technology; ●the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies ●lack of synergy, or inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisitions; ●the risk that the issuance of our common stock, if any, in an acquisition or merger could be dilutive to our shareholders; ●the inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies; ●the acquired assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired assets.  Our financial position and results of operations may be materially harmed if we are unable to recoup our investment in research and development. The rapid change in technology in our industry requires that we continue to make substantial investments in research and development and selective acquisitions of technologies and products, in order to enhance the performance and functionality of our product line, to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands for improved performance, features and functionality.  These efforts include those related to the development of technology for the commercialization of carbon nanotubes. There can be no assurance that revenue from future products or enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products, enhancements or acquisitions, or that we will be able to secure the financial resources necessary to fund future research and development or acquisitions.  Research and development costs are typically incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a product, and not all development activities result in commercially viable products.  In addition, we cannot ensure that products or enhancements will receive market acceptance, or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us.  Our business could be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices, or if our products are not accepted by the markets in which we operate.  14  We have made investments in our proprietary technologies. If third parties violate our proprietary rights, or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietary rights, such events could result in a loss of value of some of our intellectual property or costly litigation. Our success is dependent in part on our technologies and our other proprietary rights.  We believe that while patents can be useful and may be utilized by us in the future, they are not always necessary or feasible to protect our intellectual property. The process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive, and we cannot be certain that applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us.  In addition to patent protection, we have also historically protected our proprietary information and intellectual property such as design specifications, blueprints, technical processes and employee know-how, by limiting access to this confidential information and trade secrets and through the use of non-disclosure agreements. Other companies and individuals, including our larger competitors, may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology, or design around the intellectual property that we own or license.  Our failure to adequately protect our intellectual property, could result in the reduction or extinguishment of our rights to such intellectual property. We also assert rights to certain trademarks relating to certain of our products and product lines. We have not filed trademark applications to protect such marks with any governmental agency, including, but not limited to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation, but we have not filed any copyright applications with the U.S. Copyright Office in connection with those works.  As a result, we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties.   While patent, copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property may be important, we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel.  We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through other internal security measures.  However, these employees, consultants and third parties may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing.  In addition, the laws of certain territories in which we sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Occasionally, we may receive communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights or other intellectual property rights that they believe cover certain of our products, processes, technologies or information.  If such cases arise, we will evaluate our position and consider the available alternatives, which may include seeking licenses to use the technology in question on commercially reasonable terms, or defending our position.  Nevertheless, we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain licenses, or, if we are able to obtain licenses, that related terms will be acceptable, or that litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur.  Defending our intellectual property rights through litigation could be very costly.  If we are not able to negotiate the necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or successfully defend our position, our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.  15  Our reputation and operating performance may be negatively affected if our products are not timely delivered. We provide complex products that often require substantial lead-time for design, ordering parts and materials, and for assembly and installation. The time required to design, order parts and materials and to manufacture, assemble and install our products, may in turn lead to delays or shortages in the availability of some products. If a product is delayed or is the subject of shortage because of problems with our ability to design, manufacture or assemble the product on a timely basis, or if a product or software otherwise fails to meet performance criteria, we may lose revenue opportunities entirely, or experience delays in revenue recognition associated with a product or service. In addition, we may incur higher operating expenses during the period required to correct the problem. Our lengthy and variable sales cycle may make it difficult to predict our financial results. The marketing, sale and manufacture of our products, often requires a lengthy sales cycle ranging from several months to over one year before we can complete production and delivery. The lengthy sales cycle makes forecasting the volume and timing of sales difficult, and raises additional risks that customers may cancel or decide not to enter into contracts. The length of the sales cycle depends on the size and complexity of the project, the customer’s in-depth evaluation of our products, and, in some cases, the protracted nature of a bidding process. Because a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed, we may incur substantial expense before we earn associated revenue. If customer cancellations occur, they could result in the loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our operating expenses. We anticipate continued growth in our revenues and operations during the next few years. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may experience difficulty in filling customer orders, declining product quality, increased costs or other operating challenges. We anticipate that continued growth of our operations will be required to satisfy our projected increase in demand for our products and to avail ourselves of new market opportunities. The expanding scope of our business and the growth in the number of our employees, customers and products have placed and will continue to place a significant strain on our management, information technology systems, manufacturing facilities and other resources. To properly manage our growth, we may need to hire additional employees, upgrade our existing financial and reporting systems and improve our business processes and controls. We may also be required to expand our manufacturing facilities or add new manufacturing facilities. Failure to effectively manage our growth could make it difficult to manufacture our products and fill orders, as well as lead to declines in product quality or increased costs; any of these would adversely impact our business and results of operations. Historically, we have only manufactured in unit or small batch quantities. If we receive orders for a large number of our systems, we may not have the internal manufacturing capacity to fill these orders on a timely basis, if at all, and may be forced to subcontract or outsource some of the fabrication of these systems to third parties. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully subcontract or outsource the fabrication of our systems at a reasonable cost to us, or that such third parties will adhere to our quality control standards.  16  Our business might be adversely affected by our dependence on foreign business. During the year ended December 31, 2016, 11.9% of our revenues came from foreign exports as compared with 9.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Because a significant amount of our revenues are derived from international customers, our operating results could be negatively affected by a decline in the economies of any of the countries or regions in which we do business.  Each region in the global semiconductor and electronics equipment market exhibits unique characteristics, which can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period.  Periodic local or international economic downturns, trade balance issues and political instability, as well as fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates, could negatively affect our business and results of operations. All of our sales to date have been priced in U.S. dollars. While our business has not been materially affected in the past by currency fluctuations, there is a risk that it may be materially adversely affected in the future.  Such risks include possible losses due to both currency exchange rate fluctuations and from possible social and political instability.   Failure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have agreements with third parties and make sales in countries known to experience corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices. We can make no assurance, however, that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If our critical suppliers fail to deliver sufficient quantities of quality materials and components in a timely and cost-effective manner, it could negatively affect our business. We do not manufacture many components used in the production of our products, and consequently, we use numerous unrelated suppliers of materials and components.  We generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers.  Because of the variability and uniqueness of our customer’s orders, we try to avoid maintaining an extensive inventory of materials and components for manufacturing. While we are not dependent on any principal or major supplier for most of our material and component needs, switching over to an alternative supplier may take significant amounts of time and added expense, which could result in a disruption of our operations and adversely affect our business.   17  It is not always practical or even possible to ensure that component parts are available from multiple suppliers; accordingly, we procure some key parts from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers.  At certain times, increases in demand for capital equipment can result in longer lead-times for many important system components, which may cause delays in meeting shipments to our customers.  The delay in the shipment of even a few systems could cause significant variations in our quarterly revenue, operating results and the market value of our common stock.  We cannot assure you that our financial position and results of operations will not be materially and adversely affected if, in the future, we do not receive in a timely and cost-effective manner a sufficient quantity of quality component parts and materials to meet our production requirements. We might require additional financing to expand our operations. We may require additional financing to further implement our growth plans.  We cannot assure you any additional financing will be available if and when required, or, even if available, that it would not materially dilute the ownership percentage of the then existing shareholders. Cost of compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could adversely affect future operating results, the trading price of our common stock and failure to comply could result in loss of our stock market listing, civil penalties and other liabilities. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires management to certify that it has tested and found the company’s internal controls to be effective.  It also requires, for accelerated filers, that a company’s independent auditors attest that such management representations are reasonably founded.  The adequacy of internal controls generally takes into consideration that the anticipated benefits of a control should outweigh the cost of that control.  Auditing standards related to the internal control requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act will significantly increase the cost and time needed to comply with the requirements of Section 404.  Complying with these requirements is very complex, costly and time consuming and, if we are required to comply under the existing regulations, will have a material impact on our operating results.  Failure to comply could result in civil penalties, loss of our listing on NASDAQ, and the imposition of possible litigation.   Changes in accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our financial results. Changes in accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results. New accounting pronouncements or taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements or taxation practices have occurred and may occur in the future. New rules, changes to existing rules, or the questioning of our current or past practices may adversely affect our reported financial results.  18  We may be required to take additional impairment charges on assets. We are required to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment, or on an interim basis, whenever certain events occur or circumstances change, such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount. We are also required to test our long-lived assets, including acquired intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, for recoverability and impairment whenever there are indicators or impairment, such as an adverse change in business climate. As part of our long-term strategy, we may pursue future acquisitions of other companies or assets which could potentially increase our assets. Adverse changes in business conditions could materially impact our estimates of future operations and result in impairment charges to these assets. If our assets were impaired, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The price of our common shares is volatile and could decline significantly. The stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular has experienced volatility. If those industry-based market fluctuations continue, the trading price of our common shares could decline significantly independent of the overall market, and shareholders could lose all or a substantial part of their investment. The market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors, including, among others:  ●difficult macroeconomic conditions, unfavorable geopolitical events, and general stock market uncertainties, such as those occasioned by a global liquidity crises and a failure of large financial institutions; ●receipt of large orders or cancellations of orders for our products; ●issues associated with the performance and reliability of our products; ●actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations; ●announcements of financial developments or technological innovations; ●changes in recommendations and/or financial estimates by investment research analysis; ●strategic transactions, such as acquisitions, divestitures, or spin-offs; and ●the occurrence of major catastrophic eventsSignificant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to our publicly traded securities and technology companies generally. The price of our common shares is likely to be volatile in the future. In the past, securities class action litigation often has been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. If similar litigation were pursued against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. We face the risk of product liability claims.  The manufacture and sale of our products, which in operation may involve the use of toxic materials and extreme temperatures, involve the risk of product liability claims. For example, our rapid thermal processing systems are used to heat semiconductor materials to temperatures in excess of 1000º Celsius. In addition, a failure of one of our products at a customer site could interrupt the business operations of our customer. Our existing insurance coverage limits may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities that we might incur in connection with the manufacture and sale of our products if a successful product liability claim or series of product liability claims were brought against us.   19  We are subject to environmental regulations, and our inability or failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business. We are subject to environmental regulations in connection with our business operations, including regulations related to the development and manufacture of our products and our customers’ use of our products. Our failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental regulations could result in significant remediation liabilities, the imposition of fines or the suspension or termination of development, manufacturing or use of certain of our products, or affect the operation of our facilities, use or value of our real property, each of which could damage our financial position and results of operations. If we are subject to cyber-attacks we could incur substantial costs and, if such attacks are successful, we could incur significant liabilities, reputational harm, and disruption to our operations. We manage, store and transmit proprietary information and sensitive data relating to our operations. We may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use for these purposes. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate and/or compromise our confidential information (and or third party confidential information), create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or our products, or that otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. The costs to address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers, impeding our sales, manufacturing, distribution, or other critical functions. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive data about us, our customer, or other third parties, could expose us, our customers, or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business. Regulations related to conflict minerals will force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chains more complex, and may result in damage to our relationships with customers.  20  Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted requirements for companies that manufacture products that contain certain minerals and metals known as conflict minerals. These rules require public companies to perform diligence and to report annually to the SEC whether such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of minerals we use in the manufacture of our products. In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products. Given the complexity of our supply chain, we may not be able to ascertain the origins of these minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as conflict mineral free, which could harm our relationships with these customers and lead to a loss of revenue. These requirements could limit the pool of suppliers that can provide conflict-free minerals, and we may be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at competitive prices, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability. "
11,CVV,CVD EQUIPMENT CORP,2016-03-30,"     Risk Factors
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K stockholders should carefully consider the risk factors described below. The risks set forth below may not be the only risk factors relating to the company. Any of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and stock price. If demand declines for chemical vapor deposition, gas control and related equipment, or for carbon nanotube and nanowire deposition systems, our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our products are utilized to develop and manufacture materials and coatings for industrial and research applications that are used in numerous markets including but not limited to aerospace, medical, solar, nano and advanced electronic components. A significant part of our growth strategy involves continued expansion of the sales of our products for industrial as well as research and development purposes by companies, universities and government-funded research laboratories. The availability of funds for these purposes may be subject to budgetary and political restrictions, as well as cost-cutting measures by manufacturers in the markets in which we operate. If the availability of funds or the demand for capital equipment in the markets in which we operate declines, the demand for our products would also decline and our financial position and results of operations could be harmed. The conditions of the markets in which we operate are volatile. The demand for our products and the profitability of our products can change significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors. The industries in which we operate are characterized by ongoing changes, including:  ●the availability of funds for research and development; ●global and regional economic conditions; ●governmental budgetary and political constraints ●changes in the capacity utilization and production volume for research and industrial applications in the markets in which we operate ●the profitability and capital resources of manufacturers in the markets in which we operate ●changes in technology For these and other reasons, our results of operations for past periods may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results.  8  Volatile and cyclical demand for our products may make it difficult for us to accurately budget our expense levels, which are based in part on our projections of future revenues. Demand for our equipment and related consumable products may be volatile as a result of sudden changes in supply and demand, and other factors in the manufacturing process. Our orders tend to be more volatile than our revenue, as any change in demand is reflected immediately in orders booked, which are net of cancellations, while revenue, tends to be recognized over multiple quarters as a result of procurement and production lead times, and the deferral of certain revenue under our revenue recognition policies. The fiscal period in which we are able to recognize revenue is also at times subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment. This could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate. When cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in for us to remain competitive and financially sound. During a down cycle, we must be able to make timely adjustments to our cost and expense structure to correspond to the prevailing market conditions. In addition, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and the number of our personnel to meet customer demand, which may require additional liquidity. We can provide no assurance, that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to changes within the industry cycles in which we operate. If we fail to respond to these cyclical change, our business could be seriously harmed. We do not have long-term volume production contracts with our customers, and we do not control the timing or volume of orders placed by our customers. Whether and to what extent our customers place orders for any specific products, and the mix and quantities of products included in those orders are factors beyond our control. Insufficient orders would result in under-utilization of our manufacturing facilities and infrastructure, and will negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. We face significant competition and we are relatively small in size and have fewer resources in comparison with many of our competitors. We face significant competition throughout the world, which may increase as certain markets in which we operate continue to evolve. Some of our competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than us to develop new products and to support customers worldwide. Our future performance depends, in part, upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide. Some of our competitors are diversified companies that have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive research, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we can provide. We face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products, some of which compete with the products and services that we offer, as well as companies, universities and research laboratories that have the capacity to design and build their own equipment internally. These competitors may bundle their products and services in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products. In addition, we face competition from smaller emerging processing equipment companies, whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer at often lower prices than ours, using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets. Loss of competitive position could impair our prices, customer orders, revenue, gross margin and market share, any of which would negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. Our failure to compete successfully with these other companies would seriously harm our business. There is a risk that larger, better financed competitors will develop and market more advanced products than those we currently offer, or that competitors with greater financial resources may decrease prices, thereby putting us under financial pressure.  9  We face risks associated with selling our products to a highly concentrated customer base.  In fiscal 2015, approximately 63.3% of our net sales was accounted for by 2 customers. We expect that contracts or orders from a relatively limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our business. The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. If any of our significant customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, we may not be able to replace the business in a timely manner or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Major customers may also seek, and on occasion receive, pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to us.  The health and environmental effects of nanotechnology are unknown, and this uncertainty could adversely affect the expansion of our business. The health and environmental effects of nanotechnology are unknown. There is no scientific agreement on the health effects of nanomaterials in general and carbon nanotubes, in particular, but some scientists believe that in some cases, nanomaterials may be hazardous to an individual’s health or to the environment. The science of nanotechnology is based on arranging atoms in such a way as to modify or build materials not made in nature; therefore, the effects are unknown. Future research into the effects of nanomaterials in general, and carbon nanotubes in particular, on health and environmental issues, may have an adverse effect on products incorporating nanotechnology. Since part of our growth strategy is based on sales of research equipment for the production of carbon nanotubes and the sale of such materials, the determination that these materials are harmful could adversely affect the expansion of our business. We may experience increasing price pressure. Our historical business strategy for many of our products has focused on product performance and customer service rather than on price. As a result of budgetary constraints, many of our customers are extremely price sensitive when purchasing of capital equipment. If we are unable to obtain prices that allow us to continue to compete on the basis of product performance and customer service, our profit margins will be reduced. We may not be able to keep pace with the rapid change in the technology we use in our products. We believe that our continued success in the markets in which we operate depends, in part, on our ability to continually improve existing technologies and to develop and manufacture new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. We must be able to introduce these products and product enhancements into the market in a timely manner, in response to customer’s demands for higher-performance research and assembly equipment, customized to address rapid technological advances in capital equipment designs.  10  Technological innovations are inherently complex, and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing. Our future business success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products, or new uses for existing products, that successfully address changing customer needs. Our success also depends on our ability to achieve market acceptance of our new products. In order to maintain our success in the marketplace, we may have to substantially increase our expenditures on research and development. If we do not develop and introduce new products, technologies or uses for existing products in a timely manner and continually find ways to reduce the cost of developing and producing them in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, our business could be seriously harmed. Manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect our ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs, while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory. Our business depends on timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of our customers. Some key parts to our products are subject to long lead-times and/or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers. Cyclical industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for us and for companies throughout our supply chain. Further, these conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations. We may also experience significant interruptions of our manufacturing operations, delays in our ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:  •the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis; •volatility in the availability and cost of materials, including rare earth elements; •difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals; •information technology or infrastructure failures; and •natural disasters or other events beyond our control (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war), particularly where it conducts manufacturing.  11  If a supplier fails to meet our requirements concerning quality, cost, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, we may transfer our business to alternative sources, which could entail manufacturing delays, additional costs, or other difficulties. In addition, if we need to rapidly increase our business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may exacerbate any interruptions in our manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on our working capital.  If any of our customers cancel or fail to accept a large system order, our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our backlog, largely consists of orders for customized systems including our chemical vapor deposition equipment and annealing and diffusion furnaces which are built to client specifications. These customized systems can have prices that range from $1.0 million to several million dollars, depending on the configuration, specific options included and any special requirements of the customer.  Because our orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer, our backlog at any particular point in time is not necessarily representative of actual sales for succeeding periods, nor does our backlog provide any assurance of achievement of revenues or that we will realize a profit from completing these orders.  Since revenues on long-term contracts are recognized by the percentage-of-completion method, if a contract is canceled, we may have to reverse revenue at such time. Our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected should any large system order be cancelled prior to shipment, or not be accepted by the customer due to alleged non-conformity with product specifications or otherwise. Likewise, a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of our customers that purchase large systems, could have a material impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results.  Our backlog does not provide any assurance that we will realize a profit from those orders, or indicate in which period revenue will be recognized. Our success is highly dependent on the technical, sales, marketing and managerial contributions of key individuals, including Leonard A. Rosenbaum, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President, and we may be unable to retain these individuals or recruit others. We depend on our senior executives, including Leonard A. Rosenbaum, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President, and certain key managers as well as, engineering, research and development, sales, marketing and manufacturing personnel, who are critical to our business. We do not have long-term employment agreements with our key employees except for one with Martin J. Teitelbaum, our General Counsel, which expires in May, 2016. We presently have two separate key person life insurance policies on the life of Leonard A. Rosenbaum, for a total insured amount of $7 million, which may not be sufficient to cover our loss of Mr. Rosenbaum’s services. Furthermore, larger competitors may be able to offer more generous compensation packages to our executives and key employees, and therefore we risk losing key personnel to those competitors. If we were to lose the services of any of our key personnel, our engineering, product development, manufacturing and sales efforts could be slowed. We may also incur increased operating expenses, and be required to divert the attention of our senior executives to search for their replacements. The integration of any new personnel could disrupt our ongoing operations.   12  We may not be able to hire or retain the number of qualified personnel, particularly engineering personnel, required for our business, which would harm the development and sales of our products and limit our ability to grow.  Competition in our industry for senior management, technical, sales, marketing and other key personnel is intense. If we are unable to retain our existing personnel, or attract and train additional qualified personnel, our growth may be limited due to a lack of capacity to develop and market our products.  In particular, we have, from time to time, experienced difficulty in hiring and retaining skilled engineers with appropriate qualifications to support our growth strategy. Our success depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified engineering personnel with experience in equipment design. Specifically, we need to continue to attract and retain mechanical, electrical, software and field service engineers to work with our direct sales force to technically qualify and perform on new sales opportunities and orders, and to demonstrate our products. The substantial lead-time required for ordering parts and materials may lead to inventory problems. The lead-time for ordering parts and materials for some of our products can be several months. As a result, we must order some components based on forecasted demand. If demand for our products lags significantly behind our forecasts, we may order more components than we require, which would result in cash flow problems as well as excess or obsolete inventory. Acquisitions can result in an increase in our operating costs, divert management’s attention away from other operational matters and expose us to other associated risks. We continually evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses and technologies, and we consider targeted acquisitions that expand our core competencies to be an important part of our future growth strategy.  In the past, we have made acquisitions of other businesses with synergistic products, services and technologies, and plan to continue to do so in the future.  Acquisitions involve numerous risks, which include but are not limited to:  ●difficulties and increased costs in connection with the integration of the personnel, operations, technologies and products of the acquired companies into our existing facilities and operations;  ●diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters;  ●failure to commercialize the acquired technology;  ●the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies;  ●lack of synergy, or inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisition;  ●the risk that the issuance of our common stock, if any, in an acquisition or merger could be dilutive to our shareholders;  ●the inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies; and  ●the acquired assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired assets.  13  Our financial position and results of operations may be materially harmed if we are unable to recoup our investment in research and development. The rapid change in technology in our industry requires that we continue to make substantial investments in research and development and selective acquisitions of technologies and products, in order to enhance the performance and functionality of our product line, to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands for improved performance, features and functionality.  These efforts include those related to the development of technology for the commercialization of carbon nanotubes. There can be no assurance that revenue from future products or enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products, enhancements or acquisitions, or that we will be able to secure the financial resources necessary to fund future research and development or acquisitions.  Research and development costs are typically incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a product, and not all development activities result in commercially viable products.  In addition, we cannot ensure that products or enhancements will receive market acceptance, or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us.  Our business could be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices, or if our products are not accepted by the markets in which we operate. We have made investments in our proprietary technologies. If third parties violate our proprietary rights, or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietary rights, such events could result in a loss of value of some of our intellectual property or costly litigation. Our success is dependent in part on our technologies and our other proprietary rights.  We believe that while patents can be useful and may be utilized by us in the future, they are not always necessary or feasible to protect our intellectual property. The process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive, and we cannot be certain that applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us.  In addition to patent protection, we have also historically protected our proprietary information and intellectual property such as design specifications, blueprints, technical processes and employee know-how, by limiting access to this confidential information and trade secrets and through the use of non-disclosure agreements. Other companies and individuals, including our larger competitors, may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology, or design around the intellectual property that we own or license.  Our failure to adequately protect our intellectual property, could result in the reduction or extinguishment of our rights to such intellectual property. We also assert rights to certain trademarks relating to certain of our products and product lines. We have not filed trademark applications to protect such marks with any governmental agency, including, but not limited to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation, but we have not filed any copyright applications with the U.S. Copyright Office in connection with those works.  As a result, we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties.    14  While patent, copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property may be important, we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel.  We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through other internal security measures.  However, these employees, consultants and third parties may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing.  In addition, the laws of certain territories in which we sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.  Occasionally, we may receive communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights or other intellectual property rights that they believe cover certain of our products, processes, technologies or information.  If such cases arise, we will evaluate our position and consider the available alternatives, which may include seeking licenses to use the technology in question on commercially reasonable terms, or defending our position.  Nevertheless, we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain licenses, or, if we are able to obtain licenses, that related terms will be acceptable, or that litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur.  Defending our intellectual property rights through litigation could be very costly.  If we are not able to negotiate the necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or successfully defend our position, our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our reputation and operating performance may be negatively affected if our products are not timely delivered. We provide complex products that often require substantial lead-time for design, ordering parts and materials, and for assembly and installation. The time required to design, order parts and materials and to manufacture, assemble and install our products, may in turn lead to delays or shortages in the availability of some products. If a product is delayed or is the subject of shortage because of problems with our ability to design, manufacture or assemble the product on a timely basis, or if a product or software otherwise fails to meet performance criteria, we may lose revenue opportunities entirely, or experience delays in revenue recognition associated with a product or service. In addition, we may incur higher operating expenses during the period required to correct the problem. Our lengthy and variable sales cycle may make it difficult to predict our financial results. The marketing, sale and manufacture of our products, often requires a lengthy sales cycle ranging from several months to over one year before we can complete production and delivery. The lengthy sales cycle makes forecasting the volume and timing of sales difficult, and raises additional risks that customers may cancel or decide not to enter into contracts. The length of the sales cycle depends on the size and complexity of the project, the customer’s in-depth evaluation of our products, and, in some cases, the protracted nature of a bidding process. Because a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed, we may incur substantial expense before we earn associated revenue. If customer cancellations occur, they could result in the loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our operating expenses.  15   We anticipate continued growth in our revenues and operations during the next few years. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may experience difficulty in filling customer orders, declining product quality, increased costs or other operating challenges. We anticipate that continued growth of our operations will be required to satisfy our projected increase in demand for our products and to avail ourselves of new market opportunities. The expanding scope of our business and the growth in the number of our employees, customers and products have placed and will continue to place a significant strain on our management, information technology systems, manufacturing facilities and other resources. To properly manage our growth, we may need to hire additional employees, upgrade our existing financial and reporting systems and improve our business processes and controls. We may also be required to expand our manufacturing facilities or add new manufacturing facilities. Failure to effectively manage our growth could make it difficult to manufacture our products and fill orders, as well as lead to declines in product quality or increased costs; any of these would adversely impact our business and results of operations. Historically, we have only manufactured in unit or small batch quantities. If we receive orders for a large number of our systems, we may not have the internal manufacturing capacity to fill these orders on a timely basis, if at all, and may be forced to subcontract or outsource some of the fabrication of these systems to third parties. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully subcontract or outsource the fabrication of our systems at a reasonable cost to us, or that such third parties will adhere to our quality control standards. Our business might be adversely affected by our dependence on foreign business. During the year ended December 31, 2015, 9.0% of our revenues came from foreign exports as compared with 20.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Because a significant amount of our revenues are derived from international customers, our operating results could be negatively affected by a decline in the economies of any of the countries or regions in which we do business.  Each region in the global semiconductor and electronics equipment market exhibits unique characteristics, which can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period.  Periodic local or international economic downturns, trade balance issues and political instability, as well as fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates, could negatively affect our business and results of operations. All of our sales to date have been priced in U.S. dollars. While our business has not been materially affected in the past by currency fluctuations, there is a risk that it may be materially adversely affected in the future.  Such risks include possible losses due to both currency exchange rate fluctuations and from possible social and political instability.    16  Failure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have agreements with third parties and make sales in countries known to experience corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices. We can make no assurance, however, that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If our critical suppliers fail to deliver sufficient quantities of quality materials and components in a timely and cost-effective manner, it could negatively affect our business. We do not manufacture many components used in the production of our products, and consequently, we use numerous unrelated suppliers of materials and components.  We generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers.  Because of the variability and uniqueness of our customer’s orders, we try to avoid maintaining an extensive inventory of materials and components for manufacturing. While we are not dependent on any principal or major supplier for most of our material and component needs, switching over to an alternative supplier may take significant amounts of time and added expense, which could result in a disruption of our operations and adversely affect our business.  It is not always practical or even possible to ensure that component parts are available from multiple suppliers; accordingly, we procure some key parts from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers.  At certain times, increases in demand for capital equipment can result in longer lead-times for many important system components, which may cause delays in meeting shipments to our customers.  The delay in the shipment of even a few systems could cause significant variations in our quarterly revenue, operating results and the market value of our common stock.  We cannot assure you that our financial position and results of operations will not be materially and adversely affected if, in the future, we do not receive in a timely and cost-effective manner a sufficient quantity of quality component parts and materials to meet our production requirements. We might require additional financing to expand our operations. We may require additional financing to further implement our growth plans.  We cannot assure you any additional financing will be available if and when required, or, even if available, that it would not materially dilute the ownership percentage of the then existing shareholders.  17  Cost of compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could adversely affect future operating results, the trading price of our common stock and failure to comply could result in loss of our stock market listing, civil penalties and other liabilities. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires management to certify that it has tested and found the company’s internal controls to be effective.  It also requires, for accelerated filers, that a company’s independent auditors attest that such management representations are reasonably founded.  The adequacy of internal controls generally takes into consideration that the anticipated benefits of a control should outweigh the cost of that control.  Auditing standards related to the internal control requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act will significantly increase the cost and time needed to comply with the requirements of Section 404.  Complying with these requirements is very complex, costly and time consuming and, if we are required to comply under the existing regulations, will have a material impact on our operating results.  Failure to comply could result in civil penalties, loss of our listing on NASDAQ, and the imposition of possible litigation.   Changes in accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our financial results. Changes in accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results. New accounting pronouncements or taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements or taxation practices have occurred and may occur in the future. New rules, changes to existing rules, or the questioning of our current or past practices may adversely affect our reported financial results. Our income taxes can change. We are subject to income tax on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis and significant judgment is required in certain instances to allocate our taxable income to a jurisdiction and to determine the related income tax expense and benefits. Losses in one jurisdiction generally may not be used to offset profits in other jurisdictions. As a result, changes in the mix of our earnings (or losses) between jurisdictions, among other factors, could alter our overall effective income tax rate, possibly resulting in significant tax rate increases. We may be required to take additional impairment charges on assets. We are required to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment, or on an interim basis, whenever certain events occur or circumstances change, such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount. We are also required to test our long-lived assets, including acquired intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, for recoverability and impairment whenever there are indicators or impairment, such as an adverse change in business climate. As part of our long-term strategy, we may pursue future acquisitions of other companies or assets which could potentially increase our assets. Adverse changes in business conditions could materially impact our estimates of future operations and result in impairment charges to these assets. If our assets were impaired, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.  18  The price of our common shares is volatile and could decline significantly. The stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular has experienced volatility. If those industry-based market fluctuations continue, the trading price of our common shares could decline significantly independent of the overall market, and shareholders could lose all or a substantial part of their investment. The market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors, including, among others:  ●difficult macroeconomic conditions, unfavorable geopolitical events, and general stock market uncertainties, such as those occasioned by a global liquidity crises and a failure of large financial institutions;   ●receipt of large orders or cancellations of orders for our products;   ●issues associated with the performance and reliability of our products;   ●actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations;   ●announcements of financial developments or technological innovations;   ●changes in recommendations and/or financial estimates by investment research analysis;   ●strategic transactions, such as acquisitions, divestitures, or spin-offs; and   ●the occurrence of major catastrophic events Significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to our publicly traded securities and technology companies generally. The price of our common shares is likely to be volatile in the future. In the past, securities class action litigation often has been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. If similar litigation were pursued against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. We face the risk of product liability claims.  The manufacture and sale of our products, which in operation may involve the use of toxic materials and extreme temperatures, involve the risk of product liability claims. For example, our rapid thermal processing systems are used to heat semiconductor materials to temperatures in excess of 1000º Celsius. In addition, a failure of one of our products at a customer site could interrupt the business operations of our customer. Our existing insurance coverage limits may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities that we might incur in connection with the manufacture and sale of our products if a successful product liability claim or series of product liability claims were brought against us.   19  We are subject to environmental regulations, and our inability or failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business. We are subject to environmental regulations in connection with our business operations, including regulations related to the development and manufacture of our products and our customers’ use of our products. Our failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental regulations could result in significant remediation liabilities, the imposition of fines or the suspension or termination of development, manufacturing or use of certain of our products, or affect the operation of our facilities, use or value of our real property, each of which could damage our financial position and results of operations. If we are subject to cyber-attacks we could incur substantial costs and, if such attacks are successful, we could incur significant liabilities, reputational harm, and disruption to our operations. We manage, store and transmit proprietary information and sensitive data relating to our operations. We may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use for these purposes. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate and/or compromise our confidential information (and or third party confidential information), create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or our products, or that otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. The costs to address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers, impeding our sales, manufacturing, distribution, or other critical functions. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive data about us, our customer, or other third parties, could expose us, our customers, or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business. Regulations related to conflict minerals will force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chains more complex, and may result in damage to our relationships with customers. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted requirements for companies that manufacture products that contain certain minerals and metals known as conflict minerals. These rules require public companies to perform diligence and to report annually to the SEC whether such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of minerals we use in the manufacture of our products. In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products. Given the complexity of our supply chain, we may not be able to ascertain the origins of these minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as conflict mineral free, which could harm our relationships with these customers and lead to a loss of revenue. These requirements could limit the pool of suppliers that can provide conflict-free minerals, and we may be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at competitive prices, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability.  20  "
