12,TGNA,TEGNA INC,2024-02-29,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSAn investment in our common stock involves risks and uncertainties and investors should consider carefully the following risk factors before investing in our securities. We seek to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet perceive or that we currently believe are immaterial may adversely affect our business and the trading price of our securities.Risks Related to Our Business and IndustryWe are impacted by demand for advertising, which, in turn, depends on a number of factors, some of which are cyclical and many of which are beyond our controlIn 2023, 44% of our revenues were derived from non-political television spot and digital advertising. Demand for advertising is highly correlated with the strength of the U.S. economy, both in the markets our stations serve and in the nation as a whole. Consequently, our operating results depend on the relative strength of the economy in our principal television markets as well as the strength or weakness of regional and national economic factors. During 2023, macroeconomic conditions, including rising interest rates, the impact of inflation, along with geopolitical concerns, created economic and political uncertainty as well as volatility in U.S. and other markets. This uncertainty and volatility caused advertisers to pull back on spending affecting our AMS revenue results. This may very well continue into 2024.Our advertising revenues can also be affected by a variety of other factors outside our control, including, among other things, the viewership of the programming offered by our television stations, local and national advertising price fluctuations, the duration and extent of any network preemption of regularly scheduled programming for any reason, and labor disputes or other disruptions at programming providers, networks or professional sports leagues.Our advertising revenues also vary substantially from year to year, driven by the political election cycle (i.e., even years, with presidential election cycles every four years driving outsized revenues); the ability and willingness of candidates and political action committees to raise and spend funds on television and digital advertising; and the competitiveness of the election races in our stations’ markets.Competition from alternative forms of media may impair our ability to grow or maintain revenue levels in traditional and new businessesAdvertising and marketing services produce a significant portion of our revenues, with our stations’ affiliated desktop, mobile and tablet advertising revenues, as well as our OTT product offerings being important components. Technology, particularly new video formats, streaming and downloading capabilities via the Internet, video-on-demand and other devices and technologies used in the entertainment industry continues to evolve rapidly, leading to alternative methods for the delivery and storage of digital content. These technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior and have empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where and how they consume news and entertainment, including through so-called “cutting the cord” and other consumption strategies.22These innovations may affect our ability to maintain the audience for our linear television product, which may make our television stations less attractive to advertisers. For example, increasing demand for content generated for consumption through other forms of media such as Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Max, Hulu, Netflix, Paramount+ or Peacock could cause our advertising revenues to decline as a result of changes to the ratings of our programming, which may materially negatively affect our business and results of operations.The value of our assets or operations may be diminished if our information technology systems fail to perform adequatelyOur information technology systems are critically important to operating our business efficiently and effectively. We rely on our information technology systems, including systems hosted and operated by third-party vendors on our behalf, to manage our business data, communications, news and advertising content, digital products, order entry, fulfillment and other business processes. The failure of information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, broadcasting disruptions, and loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results to be impacted.Our efforts to minimize the likelihood and impact of adverse cybersecurity incidents and to protect our technology and confidential information may not be successful and our business could be negatively affected In addition to the operational risks described above, our information technology systems and infrastructure, and that of our vendors, are also exposed to increasing risks related to cybersecurity incidents. Cybersecurity attacks by third parties with malicious intent, including but not limited to, attacks on these systems, pose risks to our company. Further, advances in technology and the increasing sophistication of attackers have led to more frequent and effective cyberattacks, including advanced persistent threats by state-sponsored actors, cyberattacks relying on complex social engineering or “phishing” tactics, ransomware attacks, and other methods. We take measures to minimize the risk and impact of a cyber-attack, including utilization of multi-factor authentication, deployment of firewalls, virtual private networks for mobile connections, elevated access controls, standardized vendor access, active patching monitoring / logging, and regular training of our employees related to protecting sensitive information and recognizing “phishing” attacks. The measures we employ may not always be effective to prevent or detect cyber-attacks or incidents, and unauthorized access to our technology and confidential information may occur.  Depending on the severity of the incident or cyber-attack, such events could result in business interruptions, disclosure of nonpublic information, loss of sales and customers, misstated financial data, liabilities for stolen assets or information, diversion of our management’s attention, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation, and financial consequences, any or all of which could adversely affect our business operations and reputation. In addition, cybersecurity incidents could subject us to civil liability to customers and other third parties, as well as fines, penalties, or other legal recourse imposed by governmental or regulatory authorities, which could be substantial. We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may not cover, or may be insufficient to cover, all of our losses from incidents impacting our systems or those of our vendors. In addition, our business operations may be disrupted, and our results of operations may be impaired, by the impact of breaches or cyber-attacks on our vendors, and these potential disruptions and impairments may not be covered by our insurance policies.As has historically been the case in the broadcast sector, loss of, or changes in, affiliation agreements or retransmission consent agreements could adversely affect operating results for our stations Most of our stations are covered by our network affiliation agreements with the major broadcast television networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox). Under these agreements, the television networks produce and distribute programming to us in exchange for our stations’ commitments to air the programming at specified times and to pay the networks monetary compensation and other consideration, such as commercial announcement time during the programming. The cost of network affiliation agreements represents a significant portion of our television operating expenses. Each of our network affiliation agreements has a stated expiration date. With respect to the major broadcast networks, our principal expirations occur in the following years: NBC-early 2027, CBS-2028, ABC-2026 and Fox-2025. If renewed, our network affiliation agreements may be renewed on terms that are less favorable to us. The non-renewal or termination of any of our network affiliation agreements would prevent us from being able to carry programming of the affiliate network. This loss of programming would require us to obtain replacement programming, which may involve higher costs and/or which may not be as attractive to our audiences, resulting in reduced revenues. In recent years, the networks have begun streaming their programming directly to consumers on the Internet and other distribution platforms (e.g., CBS on Paramount+ and NBC on Peacock), in some cases live or within a short period of the original network programming broadcast on local television stations, including those we own. An increase in the availability of network programming on alternative platforms that either bypass or provide less favorable terms to local stations – such as cable channels, the Internet and other distribution vehicles – may dilute the exclusivity and the value of network programming originally broadcast by our stations and could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of our stations.23Our retransmission consent agreements with major cable, satellite and telecommunications service providers (also referred to as multichannel video programming distributors or MVPDs) permit them to retransmit our stations’ signals to their subscribers in exchange for the payment of compensation to us (which we classify as subscription revenues). This source of revenue represented approximately 52% of our 2023 total revenues. On occasion, we may not be able to agree on mutually acceptable terms when negotiating renewals as we experienced in renewal negotiations with a major MVPD in early December 2023 which was subsequently resolved in January 2024. When this happens, the MVPD will be required to cease airing our programming (commonly referred to as a “blackout” or “going dark”), and we will not be compensated by the MVPD during the period of the blackout. Future blackouts, should they occur, or if we are unable to renew our retransmission agreements on market terms, or at all, could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We operate our business in a single broadcast segment, which increases our exposure to the changes and highly competitive environment of the broadcast industry Broadcast companies operate in a highly competitive environment and compete for audiences, advertising and marketing services revenue and quality programming. Lower audience share, declines in advertising and marketing services spending, and increased programming costs would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against existing, new or potential competitors, or that competition and consolidation in the media marketplace will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.In addition, the FCC and Congress may enact new laws and regulations, and/or changes to existing laws and regulations, that could impact media ownership and other broadcast-related activities. Changes to FCC rules may lead to additional opportunities as well as increased uncertainty in the industry. Changing regulations may also impair or reduce our leverage in negotiating affiliation or retransmission agreements, adversely affecting our revenues, or result in increased costs, reduced valuations for certain broadcasting properties or other impacts, all of which may adversely impact our future profitability. All of our stations are required to hold broadcasting licenses from the FCC; when granted, these licenses are generally granted for a period of eight years. Under certain circumstances, the FCC is not required to renew any license and could decline to renew future license applications.Changes in the regulatory environment could increase our costs or limit our opportunities for growthOur stations are subject to various obligations and restrictions under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act), and FCC regulations. These requirements may be affected by legislation, FCC actions, or court decisions, and any such changes may affect the performance of our business, such as by imposing new obligations or by limiting our television stations’ exclusivity or retransmission consent rights. Broadcast station acquisitions also are subject to FCC review and approval. If FCC rules and policies, including broadcast ownership rules become more restrictive, our opportunities to grow our broadcast business through acquisitions or other strategic transactions could be impaired.In addition, prospective acquisition activities may be subject to antitrust review by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ). DOJ’s review could result in restrictions on our ability to pursue or consummate future transactions, and/or a requirement that we divest certain television stations if an acquisition would result in excessive concentration in a market. Review and enforcement policies of the DOJ may be subject to change, including as a result of changes in administration or in DOJ leadership. As a result, we cannot assure investors that any future transaction that we enter into will be approved, or that a requirement to divest existing stations will not have an adverse effect on the transaction or on our business.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockThere could be significant liability if the spin-off of Cars.com was determined to be a taxable transaction In May 2017 we completed our spin-off of Cars.com, which we refer to as the “spin-off”. In connection with the spin-off, we received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the requirements for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code were satisfied. The opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from TEGNA and the spun-off business regarding the past and future conduct of the company’s business and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is incorrect or not satisfied, TEGNA and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities.Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel, the Internal Revenue Service could determine on audit that the spin-off is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings were incorrect or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the share ownership of TEGNA or the spun-off business after the separation. If the spin-off was determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, TEGNA and its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. Our 2017 tax year is currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service and the relevant federal statute of limitations remains open until September 30, 2024. 24Our strategic acquisitions, investments and partnerships could pose various risks, increase our leverage and may significantly impact our ability to expand our overall profitabilityAcquisitions involve inherent risks, such as increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures and facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flow and could strain our human resources. We may be unable to successfully complete acquisitions, implement effective cost controls, achieve expected synergies or increase revenues as a result of an acquisition. Acquisitions may result in us assuming unexpected liabilities and in management diverting its attention from the operation of our business. Acquisitions may result in us having greater exposure to the industry risks of the businesses underlying the acquisition. Strategic investments and partnerships with other companies expose us to the risk that we may be unable to control the operations of our investee or partnership, which could decrease the amount of benefits we realize from a particular relationship. We are exposed to the risk that our partners in strategic investments and infrastructure may encounter financial difficulties which could disrupt investee or partnership activities, or impair assets acquired, which would adversely affect future reported results of operations and shareholders’ equity. The failure to obtain regulatory approvals or required consents of broadcast television networks or other third parties may prevent us from completing or realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions. Furthermore, acquisitions may subject us to new or different regulations which could have an adverse effect on our operations.Volatility in the U.S. credit markets could significantly impact our ability to obtain new financing to fund our operations or to refinance our existing debt at reasonable rates and terms as it maturesAs of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $3.09 billion in debt and approximately $1.49 billion of undrawn additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. On January 25, 2024, the revolving credit facility was amended to, among other things, reduce the Five-Year Commitments (as defined in the Credit Agreement) from $1.51 billion to $750 million and to extend the term, as further described in Part II, Item 7 below. Our fixed rate term debt matures at various times during the years 2026 - 2029. If our operating results deteriorate significantly, we may not be able to pay amounts when due and a portion of these maturities may need to be refinanced. Access to the capital markets for longer-term financing is generally unpredictable and volatile credit markets could make it harder for us to obtain debt financings. In addition, any amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility in the future are subject to a variable rate.The value of our existing intangible assets may become impaired, depending upon future operating resultsGoodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $5.31 billion as of December 31, 2023, representing approximately 76% of our total assets. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing and more frequent testing upon the occurrence of certain events or significant changes in circumstances that indicate all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable in which case a non-cash charge to earnings may be necessary. We may subsequently experience market pressures that could cause future cash flows to decline below our current expectations, or volatile equity markets could negatively impact market factors used in the impairment analysis, including earnings multiples, discount rates, and long-term growth rates. Any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely affect future reported results of operations and shareholders’ equity, although such charges would not affect our cash flow.We may not realize the anticipated benefits of our share repurchase programs and any failure to repurchase our common stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our stock priceOn June 2, 2023, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program under which we repurchased $300 million of our common stock. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2023. On November 9, 2023, we entered into a second ASR program under which we repurchased an additional $325 million of our common stock. This program was completed in February 2024. Both of these ASR agreements are in addition to the $650.0 million share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in December 2023 which expires on December 31, 2025.The timing and amount of any repurchases under share repurchase programs will depend on factors such as the stock price, economic and market conditions, and corporate and regulatory requirements. Any failure to repurchase shares after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence and the price of our common stock.The existence of share repurchase programs could cause the price of the Company’s common stock to be higher than it otherwise would be and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Although a share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance it will do so because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the effectiveness of the program.Repurchasing common stock will reduce the amount of cash we have available to fund capital expenditures, interest payments, dividends, share repurchases, investments in strategic initiatives and other operating requirements and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these share repurchase programs.25"
9,TGNA,TEGNA INC,2023-02-27,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSAn investment in our common stock involves risks and uncertainties and investors should consider carefully the following risk factors before investing in our securities. We seek to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet perceive or that we currently believe are immaterial may adversely affect our business and the trading price of our securities.Risks Related to the MergerThe Merger is subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions, including conditions that may not be satisfied or completed on a timely basis, if at all.The consummation of the Merger is subject to a number of important closing conditions that make the closing and timing of the Merger uncertain. The conditions include, among others, (i) the approval of the Merger Agreement by the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote thereon (which was received on May 17, 2022); (ii) the absence of any injunction or order by a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or law in the United States having been adopted prohibiting the consummation of the Merger; (iii) the expiration or termination of all waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, applicable to the Merger and the transactions contemplated by that certain Contribution and Exchange Agreement entered into concurrently with the Merger Agreement by the Parent Restructuring Entities (the Contribution Agreement) (all such waiting periods have expired); (iv) the grant by the FCC of applications required to be filed with the FCC to obtain the approvals of the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act and FCC rules necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Contribution Agreement (the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement, the Restructuring), including a petition for declaratory ruling under Section 310(b) of the Communications Act and the FCC’s rules governing foreign ownership with respect to the Merger and the Restructuring; (v) the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement (subject to certain materiality qualifiers); (vi) the performance and compliance in all material respects by the parties of their respective covenants required by the Merger Agreement to be performed or complied with by such party prior to the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time); and (vii) the absence of any “Company Material Adverse Effect” (as defined in the Merger Agreement) since September 30, 2021. We can provide no assurance that all required consents and approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions will otherwise be satisfied (or waived, if applicable), and, if all required consents and approvals are obtained and all closing conditions are satisfied (or waived, if applicable), we can provide no assurance as to the terms, conditions and timing of such consents and approvals or the timing of the completion of the Merger. Many of the conditions to completion of the Merger are not within either our or the Parent Restructuring Entities’ control, and neither us nor the Parent Restructuring Entities can predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied (or waived, if applicable). Any delay in completing the Merger could cause us not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the Merger is successfully completed within its expected timeframe.18Failure to complete the Merger in a timely manner, or at all, could negatively impact our future business and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.If the Merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of the failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals, our shareholders will not receive any payment for their shares in connection with the Merger. Instead, TEGNA will remain an independent public company, and its shares will continue to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Moreover, our ongoing business may be materially adversely affected and we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:•we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock price, and it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of the shares would return to the prices at which the shares currently trade;•we may experience negative publicity, which could have an adverse effect on our ongoing operations including, but not limited to, retaining and attracting employees, distribution partners, content partners, business clients, customers, providers, advertisers and others with whom we do business;•we will still be required to pay certain significant costs relating to the Merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor, printing and other professional services fees, which may relate to activities that we would not have undertaken other than in connection with the Merger;•the Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business, which may have delayed or prevented us from undertaking business opportunities that, absent the Merger Agreement, we may have pursued;•matters relating to the Merger require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which could result in the distraction of management from ongoing business operations and pursuing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us; and•litigation related to the Merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement.If the Merger is not consummated, the risks described above may materialize and they may have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial results and stock price, especially to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects an assumption that the Merger will be completed.We are subject to certain restrictions in the Merger Agreement that may hinder operations pending the consummation of the Merger.The Merger Agreement generally requires us to operate our business in the ordinary course pending consummation of the Merger and restricts us, without Community News Media LLC’s consent, from taking certain specified actions until the Merger is completed, subject to certain exceptions. These restrictions may affect our ability to execute our business strategies and attain our financial and other goals and may impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These restrictions could be in place for an extended period of time if the consummation of the Merger is delayed, which may delay or prevent us from undertaking business opportunities that, absent the Merger Agreement, we might have pursued, or from effectively responding to competitive pressures or industry developments. Whether or not the Merger is completed, the pending Merger may disrupt our current plans and operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. For these and other reasons, the pendency of the Merger could adversely affect our business and financial results.We will be subject to various uncertainties while the Merger is pending that may cause disruption and may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, clients, customers, and others with whom we do business.In connection with the proposed Merger, our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company following the Merger, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel while the Merger is pending. Key employees may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company following the Merger. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be able to attract and retain key employees to the same extent that we have been able to in the past. If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring, and integrating excellent personnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, we may be unable to grow and operate our business effectively.The proposed Merger further could cause disruptions to our business or business relationships, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Parties with which we have business relationships may experience uncertainty as to the future of such relationships and may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek alternative relationships with third parties or seek to alter their present business relationships with us. Parties with whom we otherwise may have sought to establish business relationships may seek alternative relationships with third parties. The pursuit of the Merger and the preparation for the 19integration may also place a significant burden on management and internal resources. The diversion of management’s attention away from day-to-day business concerns could adversely affect our financial results.Risks Related to Our Business and IndustryWe are impacted by demand for advertising, which, in turn, depends on a number of factors, some of which are cyclical and many of which are beyond our controlIn 2022, 42% of our revenues were derived from non-political television spot and digital advertising.

Consequently, our operating results depend on the relative strength of the economy in our principal television markets as well as the strength or weakness of regional and national economic factors. During 2022, macroeconomic conditions, including rising interest rates, recent spikes in inflation rates, along with geopolitical concerns, created economic and political uncertainty as well as volatility in U.S. and other markets. This uncertainty and volatility caused advertisers to pull back on spending affecting our AMS revenue results. This may very well continue into 2023. In addition, if macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. were to deteriorate there could be a significant adverse impact on our television spot and digital advertising revenues.Our advertising revenues can also be affected by a variety of other factors outside our control, including, among other things, the viewership of the programming offered by our television stations, local and national advertising price fluctuations, the duration and extent of any network preemption of regularly scheduled programming for any reason, and labor disputes or other disruptions at programming providers, networks or professional sports leagues.Our advertising revenues also vary substantially from year to year, driven by the political election cycle (i.e., even years, with presidential election cycles every four years driving outsized revenues); the ability and willingness of candidates and political action committees to raise and spend funds on television and digital advertising; and the competitiveness of the election races in our stations’ markets.Competition from alternative forms of media may impair our ability to grow or maintain revenue levels in traditional and new businessesAdvertising and marketing services produce a significant portion of our revenues, with our stations’ affiliated desktop, mobile and tablet advertising revenues, as well as our OTT product offerings being important components.

These technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior and have empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where and how they consume news and entertainment, including through so-called “cutting the cord” and other consumption strategies.These innovations may affect our ability to generate television audience, which may make our television stations less attractive to advertisers. For example, increasing demand for content generated for consumption through other forms of media such as Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, Netflix, Paramount+ or Peacock could cause our advertising revenues to decline as a result of changes to the ratings of our programming, which may materially negatively affect our business and results of operations.The value of our assets or operations may be diminished if our information technology systems fail to perform adequatelyOur information technology systems are critically important to operating our business efficiently and effectively. We rely on our information technology systems, including systems hosted and operated by third-party vendors on our behalf, to manage our business data, communications, news and advertising content, digital products, order entry, fulfillment and other business processes. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, broadcasting disruptions, and loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results to be impacted.Our efforts to minimize the likelihood and impact of adverse cybersecurity incidents and to protect our technology and confidential information may not be successful and our business could be negatively affected In addition to the operational risks described above, our informational technology systems are also exposed to increasing risks related to cybersecurity-related incidents. Cybersecurity attacks by third parties with malicious intent, including but not limited to, attacks on our or our vendors’ information technology infrastructure and unauthorized attempts to gain access to our confidential information, pose risks to our company. Further, advances in technology and the increasing sophistication of attackers have led to more frequent and effective cyberattacks, including advanced persistent threats by state-sponsored actors, cyberattacks relying on complex social engineering or “phishing” tactics, ransomware attacks, and other methods. We take measures to minimize the risk of a cyber-attack including utilization of multi-factor authentication, deployment of firewalls, virtual private networks for mobile connections, elevated access controls, standardized vendor access, active patching monitoring / logging, and regular training of our employees related to protecting sensitive information and recognizing “phishing” attacks. The 20measures we employ may not be sufficient in preventing or timely detecting breaches or cyber-attacks due to the evolving nature and ever-increasing abilities of cyber-attackers. Depending on the severity of the breach or cyber-attack, such events could result in business interruptions, disclosure of nonpublic information, loss of sales and customers, misstated financial data, liabilities for stolen assets or information, diversion of our management’s attention, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation, and financial consequences, any or all of which could adversely affect our business operations and reputation. In addition, cybersecurity breaches could subject us to civil liability to customers and other third parties as well as fines and penalties imposed by governmental or regulatory authorities, which could be substantial. We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may be insufficient to cover all of our losses from breaches of our systems. In addition, our business operations may be disrupted, and our results of operations may be impaired, by the impact of breaches or cyber-attacks on our vendors, and these potential disruptions and impairments may not be covered by our insurance policies.As has historically been the case in the broadcast sector, loss of, or changes in, affiliation agreements or retransmission consent agreements could adversely affect operating results for our stations Most of our stations are covered by our network affiliation agreements with the major broadcast television networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox).

This source of revenue represented approximately 47% of our 2022 total revenues. We recently renewed distribution agreements with multiple major MVPDs. On occasion, we may not be able to agree on mutually acceptable terms when negotiating such renewals. When this happens, the MVPD will be required to cease airing our programming (commonly referred to as a “blackout” or “going dark”), and we will not be compensated by the MVPD during the period of the blackout. Future blackouts, should they occur, or if we are unable to renew our retransmission agreements on market terms, or at all, could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, the Merger could affect our relationships with broadcast television networks and MVPDs. Please see the Risk Factor titled “We will be subject to various uncertainties while the Merger is pending that may cause disruption and may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, clients, customers, and others with whom we do business.”We operate our business in a single broadcast segment, which increases our exposure to the changes and highly competitive environment of the broadcast industry Broadcast companies operate in a highly competitive environment and compete for audiences, advertising and marketing services revenue and quality programming.

Changes to FCC rules may lead to additional opportunities as well as increased uncertainty in the industry. Changing regulations may also impair or reduce our leverage in negotiating affiliation or retransmission agreements, adversely affecting our revenues, or result in increased costs, reduced valuations for certain broadcasting properties or other impacts, all of which may adversely impact our future profitability. All of our stations are required to hold broadcasting licenses from the FCC; when granted, these licenses are generally granted for a period of eight years. Under certain circumstances, the 21FCC is not required to renew any license and could decline to renew future license applications.Changes in the regulatory environment could increase our costs or limit our opportunities for growthOur stations are subject to various obligations and restrictions under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act), and FCC regulations.

DOJ’s review could result in restrictions on our ability to pursue or consummate future transactions, and/or a requirement that we divest certain television stations if an acquisition would result in excessive concentration in a market. Review and enforcement policies of the DOJ may be subject to change, including as a result of changes in administration or in DOJ leadership. As a result, we cannot assure investors that any future transaction that we enter into will be approved, or that a requirement to divest existing stations will not have an adverse effect on the transaction or on our business.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockThere could be significant liability if the spin-off of Cars.com was determined to be a taxable transaction In May 2017 we completed our spin-off of Cars.com, which we refer to as the “spin-off”. In connection with the spin-off, we received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the requirements for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code were satisfied. The opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from TEGNA and the spun-off business regarding the past and future conduct of the company’s business and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is incorrect or not satisfied, TEGNA and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities.Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel, the Internal Revenue Service could determine on audit that the spin-off is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings were incorrect or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the share ownership of TEGNA or the spun-off business after the separation. If the spin-off was determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, TEGNA and its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. Our 2017 tax year is currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service and the relevant federal statute of limitations remains open until November 30, 2023. Volatility in the U.S. credit markets could significantly impact our ability to obtain new financing to fund our operations or to refinance our existing debt at reasonable rates and terms as it maturesAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $3.09 billion in debt and approximately $1.49 billion of undrawn additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility that expires in 2024. Our fixed rate term debt matures at various times during the years 2026-2029. If our operating results deteriorate significantly, we may not be able to pay amounts when due and a portion of these maturities may need to be refinanced. Access to the capital markets for longer-term financing is generally unpredictable and volatile credit markets could make it harder for us to obtain debt financings. In addition, the Merger Agreement prohibits us from incurring, assuming, or guaranteeing any debt, subject to certain exceptions. The value of our existing intangible assets may become impaired, depending upon future operating resultsGoodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $5.36 billion as of December 31, 2022, representing approximately 73% of our total assets. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing and more frequent testing upon the occurrence of certain events or significant changes in circumstances that indicate all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable in which case a non-cash charge to earnings may be necessary. We may subsequently experience market pressures that could cause future cash flows to decline below our current expectations, or volatile equity markets could negatively impact market factors used in the impairment analysis, including earnings multiples, discount rates, and long-term growth rates. Any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely affect future reported results of operations and shareholders’ equity, although such charges would not affect our cash flow.22"
6,TGNA,TEGNA INC,2022-03-01,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSAn investment in our common stock involves risks and uncertainties and investors should consider carefully the following risk factors before investing in our securities. We seek to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet perceive or that we currently believe are immaterial may adversely affect our business and the trading price of our securities.Risks Related to the MergerThe Merger is subject to receipt of approval from our shareholders as well as the satisfaction of other closing conditions, including conditions that may not be satisfied or completed on a timely basis, if at all.The consummation of the Merger is subject to a number of important closing conditions that make the closing and timing of the Merger uncertain. The conditions include, among others, (i) the approval of the Merger Agreement by the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote thereon; (ii) the absence of any injunction or order by a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or law in the United States having been adopted prohibiting the consummation of the Merger; (iii) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended applicable to the Merger and the transactions contemplated by that certain Contribution and Exchange Agreement entered into concurrently with the Merger Agreement by the Parent Restructuring Entities (the Contribution Agreement); (iv) the grant by the FCC of applications required to be filed with the FCC to obtain the approvals of the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act and FCC rules necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Contribution Agreement (the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement, the Restructuring), including a petition for declaratory ruling under Section 310(b) of the Communications Act and the FCC’s rules governing foreign ownership with respect to the Merger and the Restructuring; (v) the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement (subject to certain materiality qualifiers); (vi) the performance and compliance in all material respects by the parties of their respective covenants required by the Merger Agreement to be performed or complied with by such party prior to the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time); and (vii) the absence of any “Company Material Adverse Effect” (as defined in the Merger Agreement) since September 30, 2021. We can provide no assurance that all required consents and approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions will otherwise be satisfied (or waived, if applicable), and, if all required consents and approvals are obtained and all closing conditions are satisfied (or waived, if applicable), we can provide no assurance as to the terms, conditions and timing of such consents and approvals or the timing of the completion of the Merger. Many of the conditions to completion of the Merger are not within either our or the Parent Restructuring Entities’ control, and neither us nor the Parent Restructuring Entities can predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied (or waived, if applicable). Any delay in completing the Merger could cause us not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the Merger is successfully completed within its expected timeframe.18Failure to complete the Merger in a timely manner, or at all, could negatively impact our future business and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.If the Merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of our shareholders failing to adopt the Merger Agreement, our shareholders will not receive any payment for their shares in connection with the Merger. Instead, TEGNA will remain an independent public company, and its shares will continue to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Moreover, our ongoing business may be materially adversely affected and we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:•we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock price, and it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of the shares would return to the prices at which the shares currently trade;•we may experience negative publicity, which could have an adverse effect on our ongoing operations including, but not limited to, retaining and attracting employees, distribution partners, content partners, business clients, customers, providers, advertisers and others with whom we do business;•we will still be required to pay certain significant costs relating to the Merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor, printing and other professional services fees, which may relate to activities that we would not have undertaken other than in connection with the Merger;•we may be required to pay a cash termination fee as required under the Merger Agreement;•the Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business, which may have delayed or prevented us from undertaking business opportunities that, absent the Merger Agreement, we may have pursued;•matters relating to the Merger require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which could result in the distraction of management from ongoing business operations and pursuing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us; and•litigation related to the Merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement.If the Merger is not consummated, the risks described above may materialize and they may have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial results and stock price, especially to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects an assumption that the Merger will be completed.We are subject to certain restrictions in the Merger Agreement that may hinder operations pending the consummation of the Merger.The Merger Agreement generally requires us to operate our business in the ordinary course pending consummation of the Merger and restricts us, without Community News Media LLC’s consent, from taking certain specified actions until the Merger is completed, subject to certain exceptions. These restrictions may affect our ability to execute our business strategies and attain our financial and other goals and may impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These restrictions could be in place for an extended period of time if the consummation of the Merger is delayed, which may delay or prevent us from undertaking business opportunities that, absent the Merger Agreement, we might have pursued, or from effectively responding to competitive pressures or industry developments. Whether or not the Merger is completed, the pending Merger may disrupt our current plans and operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. For these and other reasons, the pendency of the Merger could adversely affect our business and financial results.We will be subject to various uncertainties while the Merger is pending that may cause disruption and may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, clients, customers, and others with whom we do business.In connection with the proposed Merger, our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company following the Merger, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel while the Merger is pending. Key employees may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company following the Merger. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be able to attract and retain key employees to the same extent that we have been able to in the past. If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring, and integrating excellent personnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, we may be unable to grow and operate our business effectively.The proposed Merger further could cause disruptions to our business or business relationships, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Parties with which we have business relationships may experience uncertainty as to the future of such relationships and may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek alternative relationships with third parties or 19seek to alter their present business relationships with us. Parties with whom we otherwise may have sought to establish business relationships may seek alternative relationships with third parties. The pursuit of the Merger and the preparation for the integration may also place a significant burden on management and internal resources. The diversion of management’s attention away from day-to-day business concerns could adversely affect our financial results.The Merger Agreement contains provisions that could make it difficult for a third party to make a superior acquisition proposal.The Merger Agreement contains certain customary restrictions on our ability to solicit proposals from third parties for an acquisition of TEGNA prior to obtaining the approval of the Merger Agreement from our shareholders. In addition, subject to certain customary “fiduciary out” exceptions, the Board is required to recommend that our shareholders vote in favor of the approval of the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.We may, under certain circumstances, be obligated to pay a termination fee to Parent and/or reimburse Parent for its expenses. These costs could require us to use cash that would have otherwise been available for other uses. These provisions might discourage an otherwise-interested third party from considering or proposing an acquisition of TEGNA, including proposals that may be deemed to offer greater value to our shareholders than as provided in the Merger Agreement. Furthermore, even if a third party elects to propose an acquisition, the requirement that we must pay a termination fee to accept any such proposal may cause that third party to offer a lower price to our stockholders than such third party might otherwise have offered.Risks Related to Our Business and IndustryWe are impacted by demand for advertising, which, in turn, depends on a number of factors, some of which are cyclical and many of which are beyond our control In 2021, 48% of our revenues were derived from television spot and digital advertising. Demand for advertising is highly correlated with the strength of the U.S. economy, both in the markets our stations serve and in the nation as a whole.  Consequently, our operating results depend on the relative strength of the economy in our principal television markets as well as the strength or weakness of regional and national economic factors. A decline in economic conditions in the U.S. could have a significant adverse impact on our businesses and could significantly impact our television spot and digital advertising revenues. Our advertising revenues can also be affected by a variety of other factors outside our control, including, among other things, the viewership of the programming offered by our television stations, local and national advertising price fluctuations, the duration and extent of any network preemption of regularly scheduled programming for any reason, and labor disputes or other disruptions at programming providers, networks or professional sports leagues. Our advertising revenues can also vary substantially from year to year, driven by the political election cycle (i.e., even years); the ability and willingness of candidates and political action committees to raise and spend funds on television and digital advertising; and the competitiveness of the election races in our stations’ markets. Competition from alternative forms of media may impair our ability to grow or maintain revenue levels in traditional and new businessesAdvertising and marketing services produce a significant portion of our revenues, with our stations’ affiliated desktop, mobile and tablet advertising revenues, as well as our OTT product offerings being important components. Technology, particularly new video formats, streaming and downloading capabilities via the Internet, video-on-demand, personal video recorders and other devices and technologies used in the entertainment industry continues to evolve rapidly, leading to alternative methods for the delivery and storage of digital content. These technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior and have empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where and how they consume news and entertainment, including through so-called “cutting the cord” and other consumption strategies. These innovations may affect our ability to generate television audience, which may make our television stations less attractive to advertisers. For example, increasing demand for content generated for consumption through other forms of media such as Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, Netflix, or Peacock could cause our advertising revenues to decline as a result of changes to the ratings of our programming, which may materially negatively affect our business and results of operations.  A resurgence in the rate of COVID-19 infections that is significant enough to force widespread business closures could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  During 2021 and continuing into 2022, the world continued to be impacted by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The emergence of the delta and omicron variants produced spiking infection rates, creating further economic uncertainty throughout the United States.20The impact of COVID-19 and the extent of its adverse impact on our financial and operating results will be dictated by how the pandemic continues to affect our advertising customers. This will depend on future pandemic-related developments including the severity of COVID-19 variants; disruptions to our customers’ supply chains and impacts to their advertising and marketing purchasing patterns; the effectiveness, distribution and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines; consumer confidence; and U.S. government actions to prevent and manage the virus spread, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. While we use the best information available in developing significant estimates included in our financial statements, the effects of the pandemic on our operations may not be fully realized, or reflected in our financial results, until future periods. As such, actual results could differ from our estimates, and these differences resulting from changes in facts and circumstances could be material. The value of our assets or operations may be diminished if our information technology systems fail to perform adequatelyOur information technology systems are critically important to operating our business efficiently and effectively. We rely on our information technology systems, including systems hosted and operated by third-party vendors on our behalf, to manage our business data, communications, news and advertising content, digital products, order entry, fulfillment and other business processes. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, broadcasting disruptions, and loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results to be impacted.Our efforts to minimize the likelihood and impact of adverse cybersecurity incidents and to protect our technology and confidential information may not be successful and our business could be negatively affected In addition to the operational risks described above, our informational technology systems are also exposed to increasing risks related to cybersecurity-related incidents. Cybersecurity attacks by third parties with malicious intent, including but not limited to, attacks on our or our vendors’ information technology infrastructure and unauthorized attempts to gain access to our confidential information, pose risks to our company. Further, advances in technology and the increasing sophistication of attackers have led to more frequent and effective cyberattacks, including advanced persistent threats by state-sponsored actors, cyberattacks relying on complex social engineering or “phishing” tactics, ransomware attacks, and other methods. We take measures to minimize the risk of a cyber-attack including utilization of multi-factor authentication, deployment of firewalls, virtual private networks for mobile connections, elevated access controls, standardized vendor access, active patching monitoring / logging, and conducting regular training of our employees related to protecting sensitive information and recognizing “phishing” attacks. While the measures we employ meet or exceed industry standards they nonetheless may not be sufficient in preventing or timely detecting breaches or cyber-attacks due to the evolving nature and ever-increasing abilities of cyber-attackers. Depending on the severity of the breach or cyber-attack, such events could result in business interruptions, disclosure of nonpublic information, loss of sales and customers, misstated financial data, liabilities for stolen assets or information, diversion of our management’s attention, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation, and financial consequences, any or all of which could adversely affect our business operations and reputation. In addition, cybersecurity breaches could subject us to civil liability to customers and other third parties as well as fines and penalties imposed by governmental or regulatory authorities, which could be substantial. We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may be insufficient to cover all of our losses from breaches of our systems. In addition, our business operations may be disrupted, and our results of operations may be impaired, by the impact of breaches or cyber-attacks on our vendors, and these potential disruptions and impairments may not be covered by our insurance policies.As has historically been the case in the broadcast sector, loss of, or changes in, affiliation agreements or retransmission consent agreements could adversely affect operating results for our stations Most of our stations are covered by our network affiliation agreements with the major broadcast television networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox). These television networks produce and distribute programming in exchange for each of our stations’ commitment to air the programming at specified times and for other consideration such as commercial announcement time during the programming. The cost of network affiliation agreements represents a significant portion of our television operating expenses. Each of our network affiliation agreements has a stated expiration date. With respect to the major broadcast networks, our principal expirations occur in the following years: NBC-early 2024, CBS-late 2022, ABC-2023 and Fox-mid 2022. If renewed, our network affiliation agreements may be renewed on terms that are less favorable to us. The non-renewal or termination of any of our network affiliation agreements would prevent us from being able to carry programming of the affiliate network. This loss of programming would require us to obtain replacement programming, which may involve higher costs and/or which may not be as attractive to our audiences, resulting in reduced revenues. In recent years, the networks have begun streaming their programming directly to consumers on the Internet and other distribution platforms (e.g., CBS on Paramount+ and NBC on Peacock), in some cases live or within a short period of the original network programming broadcast on local television stations, including those we own. An increase in the availability of network programming on alternative platforms that either bypass or provide less favorable terms to local stations - such as cable channels, the Internet and other distribution vehicles - may dilute the exclusivity and the value of network programming originally broadcast by our stations and could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of our stations.21Our retransmission consent agreements with major cable, satellite and telecommunications service providers (also referred to as multichannel video programming distributors or MVPDs) permit them to retransmit our stations’ signals to their subscribers in exchange for the payment of compensation to us (which we classify as subscription revenues). This source of revenue represented approximately 49% of our 2021 total revenues. We recently renewed distribution agreements with multiple major MVPDs at what we believe to be leading Big Four affiliates rates. On occasion, we may not be able to agree on mutually acceptable terms when negotiating such renewals as we experienced in renewal negotiations with a major broadcast satellite provider in early October 2021. When this happens, the MVPD will be required to cease airing our programming (commonly referred to as a “blackout” or “going dark”), and we will not be compensated by the MVPD during the period of the blackout as was the case with the broadcast satellite provider. Future blackouts, should they occur, or if we are unable to renew our retransmission agreements on market terms, or at all, could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, the Merger could affect our relationships with broadcast television networks and MVPDs. Please see the Risk Factor titled “We will be subject to various uncertainties while the Merger is pending that may cause disruption and may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, clients, customers, and others with whom we do business.”We operate our business in a single broadcast segment, which increases our exposure to the changes and highly competitive environment of the broadcast industry Broadcast companies operate in a highly competitive environment and compete for audiences, advertising and marketing services revenue and quality programming. Lower audience share, declines in advertising and marketing services spending, and increased programming costs would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against existing, new or potential competitors, or that competition and consolidation in the media marketplace will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.In addition, the FCC and Congress may enact new laws and regulations, and/or changes to existing laws and regulations, that could impact media ownership and other broadcast-related activities. Changes to FCC rules may lead to additional opportunities as well as increased uncertainty in the industry. Changing regulations may also impair or reduce our leverage in negotiating affiliation or retransmission agreements, adversely affecting our revenues, or result in increased costs, reduced valuations for certain broadcasting properties or other impacts, all of which may adversely impact our future profitability. All of our stations are required to hold broadcasting licenses from the FCC; when granted, these licenses are generally granted for a period of eight years. Under certain circumstances, the FCC is not required to renew any license and could decline to renew future license applications.Changes in the regulatory environment could increase our costs or limit our opportunities for growthOur stations are subject to various obligations and restrictions under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act), and FCC regulations. These requirements may be affected by legislation, FCC actions, or court decisions, and any such changes may affect the performance of our business, such as by imposing new obligations or by limiting our television stations’ exclusivity or retransmission consent rights. If broadcast ownership rules become more restrictive, our opportunities to grow our broadcast business through acquisitions or other strategic transactions could be impaired.In addition, prospective acquisition activities may be subject to antitrust review by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ). DOJ’s review could result in restrictions on our ability to pursue or consummate future transactions, and/or a requirement that we divest certain television stations if an acquisition would result in excessive concentration in a market. Review and enforcement policies of the DOJ may be subject to change, including as a result of changes in administration or in DOJ leadership. As a result, we cannot assure investors that any future transaction that we enter into will be approved, or that a requirement to divest existing stations will not have an adverse effect on the transaction or on our business.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockThere could be significant liability if the spin-off of Cars.com was determined to be a taxable transaction In May 2017 we completed our spin-off of Cars.com, which we refer to as the “spin-off”.

The opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from TEGNA and the spun-off business regarding the past and future conduct of the company’s business and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is incorrect or not satisfied, TEGNA and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities.Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel, the Internal Revenue Service could determine on audit that the spin-off is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings were incorrect or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the share ownership of TEGNA or the spun-off business after the separation. If the spin-off was determined to be taxable for U.S. 22federal income tax purposes, TEGNA and its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. Our 2017 tax year is currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service and the relevant federal statute of limitations remains open until December 31, 2022. Volatility in the U.S. credit markets could significantly impact our ability to obtain new financing to fund our operations or to refinance our existing debt at reasonable rates and terms as it maturesAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $3.26 billion in debt and approximately $1.33 billion of undrawn additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility that expires in 2024.

A resurgence in the rate of COVID-19 infections that is significant enough to force widespread business closures could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  During the first quarter of 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) believed to have been first identified in Wuhan, China, spread globally, including to every state in the United States. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. The federal and state governments in the United States have responded by instituting a wide variety of mitigating control measures, including, mandatory quarantines, closures of non-essential businesses and all other places of social interaction, while implementing “shelter in place” orders and restricting travel. Such control measures have resulted in cancellation or postponement of sporting events, including the Olympics, and suspension of popular entertainment content production. The mitigating control measures began negatively impacting our AMS revenue stream in mid-March 2020 as demand for non-political advertising and marketing services softened. During the second and third quarters of 2020, certain state and local governments began to implement multi-step policies towards re-opening and lifting the control measures. Demand for many sectors’ 19advertising and marketing services increased as this occurred. However, some states which re-opened also experienced increases in new COVID-19 cases, forcing some to reinstate control measures and restrict public gatherings. Through the end of the fourth quarter of 2020, case and fatality figures continued to trend upwards, both nationally and in many states, though several vaccines have now been approved for emergency use and are beginning to be distributed.The extent of the pandemic’s impact on our financial and operational results, which could be material, will depend on the length of time that the pandemic continues and whether we experience further waves of the infection, its effect on our customers’ demand for our advertising products (as well as their ability to pay us for services provided), the pace at which governmental regulations closing businesses and restricting movement imposed in response to the pandemic are relaxed, the success of public vaccination campaigns, the effectiveness of the vaccines against mutating strains of the virus, the effect of existing and potential economic stimulus measures passed into law, as well as uncertainty regarding all of the foregoing.While we cannot at this time predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has had, and is likely to continue to have a dampening effect on our near-term AMS revenues. In addition, a sustained adverse impact on our non-political advertising from the COVID-19 pandemic could eventually impact our ability to maintain compliance with covenants under our revolving credit facility in the future further affecting our liquidity and financial condition. In addition, we may experience an increased risk of undetected malicious cyber-security attacks due to our workforce working remotely. We continue to closely monitor the situation, to assess further possible implications to our business and customers, and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences. The value of our assets or operations may be diminished if our information technology systems fail to perform adequatelyOur information technology systems are critically important to operating our business efficiently and effectively. We rely on our information technology systems to manage our business data, communications, news and advertising content, digital products, order entry, fulfillment and other business processes.

In addition, cybersecurity breaches could subject us to civil liability to customers and other third parties as well as fines and penalties imposed by governmental or regulatory authorities which could be substantial. We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may be insufficient to cover all of our losses from breaches of our systems.As has historically been the case in the broadcast sector, loss of, or changes in, affiliation agreements or retransmission consent agreements could adversely affect operating results for our stations Most of our stations are covered by our network affiliation agreements with the major broadcast television networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox). These television networks produce and distribute programming in exchange for each of our stations’ commitment to air the programming at specified times and for other consideration such as commercial announcement time during the programming. The cost of network affiliation agreements represents a significant portion of our television operating expenses. Each of our affiliation agreements has a stated expiration date. With respect to the major broadcast networks, our principal expirations occur in the following years: NBC-early 2024, CBS-2022, Fox-2022, ABC-2023. If renewed, our network affiliation agreements may be renewed on terms that are less favorable to us. The non-renewal or termination of any of our network affiliation agreements would prevent us from being able to carry programming of the affiliate network. This loss of programming would require us to obtain replacement programming, which may involve higher costs and/or which may not be as attractive to our audiences, resulting in reduced revenues. 20In recent years, the networks have streamed their programming on the Internet and other distribution platforms (e.g., CBS All Access and Peacock NBC), in some cases live or within a short period of the original network programming broadcast on local television stations, including those we own. An increase in the availability of network programming on alternative platforms that either bypass or provide less favorable terms to local stations - such as cable channels, the Internet and other distribution vehicles - may dilute the exclusivity and value of network programming originally broadcast by the local stations and could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of our stations.Our retransmission consent agreements with major cable, satellite and telecommunications service providers (also referred to as multichannel video programming distributors or MVPDs) permit them to retransmit our stations’ signals to their subscribers in exchange for the payment of compensation to us (which we classify as subscription revenues). This source of revenue represented approximately 44% of our 2020 total revenues, and we expect the contribution of subscription revenues to increase in 2021 and to continue to increase in the foreseeable future periods. During 2020, retransmission consent agreements covering approximately 35% of our subscribers were renewed. During 2021, retransmission agreements related to approximately 30% of our subscribers will be up for renewal. On occasion, we may not be able to agree on mutually acceptable terms when negotiating such agreements. When this happens, the MVPD may be required to cease airing our programming (commonly referred to as a “blackout” or “going dark”). When this happens, we will not be compensated by the MVPD during the period of the blackout.  Furthermore, if we are unable to renew the agreement on market terms, or at all, it could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We operate our business in a single broadcast segment, which increases our exposure to the changes and highly competitive environment of the broadcast industry Broadcast companies operate in a highly competitive environment and compete for audiences, advertising and marketing services revenue and quality programming. Lower audience share, declines in advertising and marketing services spending, and increased programming costs would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against existing, new or potential competitors, or that competition and consolidation in the media marketplace will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.In addition, the FCC and Congress are contemplating several new laws and changes to existing media ownership and other broadcast-related regulations, regarding a wide range of matters (including the number of stations a company may own within a single market or nationwide). Changes to FCC rules may lead to additional opportunities as well as increased uncertainty in the industry. Changing regulations may also impair or reduce our leverage in negotiating affiliation or retransmission agreements, adversely affecting our revenues, or result in increased costs, reduced valuations for certain broadcasting properties or other impacts, all of which may adversely impact our future profitability. All of our stations are required to hold broadcasting licenses from the FCC; when granted, these licenses are generally granted for a period of eight years. Under certain circumstances, the FCC is not required to renew any license and could decline to renew future license applications.Changes in the regulatory environment could increase our costs or limit our opportunities for growthOur stations are subject to various obligations and restrictions under the Communications Act of 1934 as amended (the “Communications Act”), and FCC regulations. These requirements may be affected by legislation, FCC actions, or court decisions, and any such changes may affect the performance of our business, such as by imposing new obligations or by limiting our television stations’ exclusivity or retransmission consent rights. For instance, although the FCC voted in November 2017 to reduce restrictions on local broadcast ownership, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated and remanded these changes effective as of November 29, 2019; the U.S. Supreme Court granted petitions by the FCC and broadcasters to review the Third Circuit’s decision. Depending on the Supreme Court’s decision, the FCC’s 2017 regulatory changes could be restored, or the applicable media ownership rules could be altered in other ways by Congress or the FCC. Oral arguments in the case were held on January 19, 2021; the Supreme Court is expected to rule on the case by the end of June 2021. If broadcast ownership rules become more restrictive, our opportunities to grow our broadcast business through acquisitions or other strategic transactions could be impaired.In addition, some of our acquisition activities may be subject to antitrust review by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ), and could restrict our ability to pursue or consummate future transactions and could require us to divest certain television stations if an acquisition would result in excessive concentration in a market. Review and enforcement policies of the DOJ may be subject to change under the Biden administration. As a result, we cannot assure investors that any future acquisition will be approved, or that a requirement to divest existing stations will not have an adverse effect on the transaction or our business.21Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockThere could be significant liability if the spin-off of Cars.com was determined to be a taxable transaction In May 2017 we completed our spin-off of Cars.com, which we refer to as the “spin-off”. In connection with the spin-off, we received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the requirements for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code were satisfied. The opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from TEGNA and the spun-off business regarding the past and future conduct of the company’s business and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is incorrect or not satisfied, TEGNA and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities.Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel, the Internal Revenue Service could determine on audit that the spin-off is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings were incorrect or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the share ownership of TEGNA or the spun-off business after the separation. If the spin-off was determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, TEGNA and its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. On October 15, 2021, TEGNA’s 2017 tax year (including the tax-free treatment of the spin-off of the Cars.com business) will no longer be subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.A proxy contest with an activist shareholder could cause us to incur significant costs, divert management’s attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our businessActivist shareholders, like Standard General, may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations, advance shareholder proposals or director nominations or otherwise attempt to affect changes or acquire control over us. On January 21, 2021, Standard General nominated four directors for election in connection with our 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  Responding to these actions can be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our Board and management from the management of our operations and the pursuit of our business strategies, particularly if such activist shareholders advocate for actions that are not supported by other shareholders, our board or management. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, damage to our reputation and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified directors, personnel and business partners. These actions could also cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility.Our strategic acquisitions, investments and partnerships could pose various risks, increase our leverage and may significantly impact our ability to expand our overall profitabilityAcquisitions involve inherent risks, such as increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures and facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flow and could strain our human resources. We may be unable to successfully complete acquisitions, implement effective cost controls, achieve expected synergies or increase revenues as a result of an acquisition. Acquisitions may result in us assuming unexpected liabilities and in management diverting its attention from the operation of our business. Acquisitions may result in us having greater exposure to the industry risks of the businesses underlying the acquisition. Strategic investments and partnerships with other companies expose us to the risk that we may be unable to control the operations of our investee or partnership, which could decrease the amount of benefits we realize from a particular relationship. We are exposed to the risk that our partners in strategic investments and infrastructure may encounter financial difficulties which could disrupt investee or partnership activities, or impair assets acquired, which would adversely affect future reported results of operations and shareholders’ equity. The failure to obtain regulatory approvals or required consents of broadcast television networks or other third parties may prevent us from completing or realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions. Furthermore, acquisitions may subject us to new or different regulations which could have an adverse effect on our operations.Volatility in the U.S. credit markets could significantly impact our ability to obtain new financing to fund our operations and strategic initiatives or to refinance our existing debt at reasonable rates and terms as it maturesAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $3.58 billion in debt and approximately $1.13 billion of undrawn additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility that expires in 2024. This debt matures at various times during the years 2024-2029. While our cash flow is expected to be sufficient to pay amounts when due, if our operating results deteriorate significantly, we may not be able to pay amounts when due and a portion of these maturities may need to be refinanced. Access to the capital markets for longer-term financing is generally unpredictable and volatile credit markets could make it harder for us to obtain debt financings.22The value of our existing intangible assets may become impaired, depending upon future operating resultsGoodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $5.47 billion as of December 31, 2020, representing approximately 80% of our total assets. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing and more frequent testing upon the occurrence of certain events or significant changes in circumstance that indicate all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable in which case a non-cash charge to earnings may be necessary. We may subsequently experience market pressures which could cause future cash flows to decline below our current expectations, or volatile equity markets could negatively impact market factors used in the impairment analysis, including earnings multiples, discount rates, and long-term growth rates. Any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely affect future reported results of operations and shareholders’ equity, although such charges would not affect our cash flow"

RISK FACTORSAn investment in our common stock involves risks and uncertainties and investors should consider carefully the following risk factors before investing in our securities. We seek to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet perceive or that we currently believe are immaterial may adversely affect our business and the trading price of our securities.We are impacted by demand for advertising, which, in turn, depends on a number of factors, some of which are cyclical and many of which are beyond our control In 2019, 55% of our revenues were derived from television spot and digital advertising. Demand for advertising is highly dependent upon the strength of the U.S. economy, both in the markets our stations serve and in the nation as a whole. During an economic downturn, demand for advertising often decreases. Consequently, our operating results depend on the relative strength of the economy in our principal television markets as well as the strength or weakness of regional and national economic factors. A decline in economic conditions in the U.S. could have a significant adverse impact on our businesses and could significantly impact our television spot and digital advertising revenues. Our advertising revenues can also vary substantially from year to year, driven by the political election cycle (i.e., even years); the ability and willingness of candidates and political action committees to raise and spend funds on television and digital advertising; and the competitiveness of the election races in our stations’ markets. Advertising revenues will also vary based on the coverage of major sporting events (e.g., Olympics and Super Bowl) due to our high concentration of NBC stations.  Competition from alternative forms of media may impair our ability to grow or maintain revenue levels in traditional and new businessesAdvertising and marketing services produce the majority of our revenues, with our stations’ affiliated desktop, mobile and tablet advertising revenues, as well as our OTT product offerings being important components. Technology, particularly new video formats, streaming and downloading capabilities via the Internet, video-on-demand, personal video recorders and other devices and technologies used in the entertainment industry continues to evolve rapidly, leading to alternative methods for the delivery and storage of digital content. These technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior and have empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where and how they consume news and entertainment, including through so-called “cutting the cord” and other consumption strategies. These innovations may affect our ability to generate television audience, which may make our television stations less attractive to advertisers. For example, increasing demand for content generated for consumption through other forms of media such as Amazon Prime, Disney+, HBO Go, Hulu, or Netflix, could cause our advertising revenues to decline as a result of changes to the ratings of our programming, which may materially negatively affect our business and results of operations.   The value of our assets or operations may be diminished if our information technology systems fail to perform adequatelyOur information technology systems are critically important to operating our business efficiently and effectively. We rely on our information technology systems to manage our business data, communications, news and advertising content, digital products, order entry, fulfillment and other business processes. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, broadcasting disruptions, and loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results to be impacted.Our efforts to minimize the likelihood and impact of adverse cybersecurity incidents and to protect our technology and confidential information may not be successful and our business could be negatively affected Our information technology systems are critically important to operating our business efficiently and effectively. We rely on our information technology systems to manage our business data, communications, news and advertising content, digital products, order entry, fulfillment and other business processes. As such, we are exposed to various cybersecurity threats, including but not limited to, threats to our information technology infrastructure, and unauthorized attempts to gain access to our confidential information, including third parties which receive our confidential information for business purposes. We take measures to minimize the risk of a cyber-attack including utilization of multi-factor authentication, deployment of firewalls, virtual private networks for mobile connections and conducting regular training of our employees related to protecting sensitive information and recognizing “phishing” attacks. These measures, however, may not be sufficient in preventing or the timely 15detection of breaches or cyber-attacks due to the evolving nature and ever-increasing abilities of cyber-attacks. Depending on the severity of the breach or cyber-attack, such events could result in business interruptions, disclosure of nonpublic information, loss of sales and customers, misstated financial data, liabilities for stolen assets or information, diversion of our management’s attention, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation, and financial consequences, any or all of which could adversely affect our business operations and reputation.

If broadcast ownership rules become more restrictive, our opportunities to grow our broadcast business through acquisitions or other strategic transactions could be impaired.There could be significant liability if the spin-off of Cars.com was determined to be a taxable transaction In May 2017 we completed our spin-off of Cars.com, which we refer to as the ”spin-off”. In connection with the spin-off, we received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the requirements for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code were satisfied. The opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from TEGNA and the spun-off business regarding the past and future conduct of the company’s business and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is incorrect or not satisfied, TEGNA and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities.Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel, the Internal Revenue Service could determine on audit that the spin-off is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings were incorrect or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the share ownership of TEGNA or the spun-off business after the separation. If the spin-off was determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, TEGNA and its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. Our proxy contest with Standard General L.P. has caused and could continue to cause us to incur significant costs, divert management’s attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our businessActivist shareholders, like Standard General, may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations, advance shareholder  proposals or otherwise attempt to affect changes or acquire control over us. Responding to these actions can be costly and time-consuming, divert the attention of our Board and management from the management of our operations and the pursuit of our business strategies, particularly if such activist shareholders advocate actions that are not supported by other shareholders, our board or management. In 2019, we incurred advisory fees of $6.1 million related to the pending proxy contest with Standard General, and have incurred additional costs in the first quarter of 2020. In addition to the incurred costs, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, damage to our reputation and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified directors, personnel and business partners. These actions could also cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility.Our strategic acquisitions, investments and partnerships could pose various risks, increase our leverage and may significantly impact our ability to expand our overall profitabilityAcquisitions involve inherent risks, such as increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures and facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flow and could strain our human resources.

Additional risks that we do not yet perceive or that we currently believe are immaterial may adversely affect our business and the trading price of our securities.Changes in economic conditions in the U.S. markets we serve may depress demand for our products and services We generate a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of advertising at our television stations. Expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions, as well as budgeting and buying patterns. As a result, our operating results depend on the relative strength of the economy in our principal television markets as well as the strength or weakness of regional and national economic factors. A decline in economic conditions in the U.S. could have a significant adverse impact on our businesses and could significantly impact all key advertising revenue categories.

We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may be insufficient to cover all of our losses from any future breaches of our systems.As has historically been the case in the broadcast sector, loss of, or changes in, affiliation agreements or retransmission consent agreements could adversely affect operating results for our stations Most of our stations are covered by our network affiliation agreements with the major broadcast television networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox). These television networks produce and distribute programming in exchange for each of our stations’ commitment to air the programming at specified times and for other consideration such as commercial announcement time during the programming. The cost of network affiliation agreements represents a significant portion of our television operating expenses. Each of our affiliation agreements has a stated expiration date. With respect to the major broadcast networks, our earliest expirations occur in the following years: NBC-2021, CBS-2019, ABC-2023, Fox-2019. If renewed, our network affiliation agreements may be renewed on terms that are less favorable to us.

This source of revenue represented approximately 38% of our 2018 total revenues, and we expect subscription revenues to increase in 2019 and moving forward. During 2019, retransmission consent agreements covering approximately 50% of our subscribers expire. If we are unable to negotiate and renew these agreements on favorable terms, or at all, the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our ability to increase our subscription revenues, negatively impacting our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We operate our business in a single broadcast segment, which increases our exposure to the changes and highly competitive environment of the broadcast industry.We operate as a single business segment which has more broadcast sector concentration. Broadcast companies operate in a highly competitive environment and compete for audiences, advertising and marketing services revenue and quality programing. Lower audience share, declines in advertising and marketing services spending, and increased programming costs would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, the FCC and Congress are contemplating several new laws and changes to existing media ownership and other broadcast-related regulations, regarding a wide range of matters (including permitting companies to own more stations in a single market, as well as owning more stations nationwide). Changes to FCC rules may lead to additional opportunities as well as increased uncertainty in the industry. We cannot be assured that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing, new or potential competitors, or that competition and consolidation in the media marketplace will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Changing regulations may also impair or reduce our leverage in negotiating affiliation or retransmission agreements, adversely affecting our revenues, or result in increased costs, reduced valuations for certain broadcasting properties or other impacts, all of which may adversely impact our future profitability. All of our television stations are required to hold television broadcasting licenses from the FCC; when granted, these licenses are generally granted for a period of eight years. Under certain circumstances, the FCC is not required to renew any license and could decline to renew future license applications.Changes in the regulatory environment could increase our costs or limit our opportunities for growthOur television stations are subject to various obligations and restrictions under the Communications Act and FCC regulations. These requirements may be affected by legislation, FCC actions, or court decisions, and any such changes may affect the performance of our business, such as by imposing new obligations or by limiting our television stations’ exclusivity or retransmission consent rights. In addition, although the FCC voted in November 2017 to reduce restrictions on local broadcast 13ownership, these regulatory changes could be overturned in pending court challenges or could be reversed in the future by Congress or the FCC. If broadcast ownership rules become more restrictive, our opportunities to grow our broadcast business through acquisitions or other strategic transactions could be impaired.There could be significant liability if the spin-off of either the publishing businesses or Cars.com were determined to be a taxable transaction In June 2015, we spun off our former publishing businesses, Gannett Co. Inc. (Gannett) and in May 2017 we completed our spin-off of Cars.com, collectively “the spin-offs”. In connection with each of the spin-offs, we received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the requirements for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code were satisfied. The opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from TEGNA and the spun-off businesses regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is incorrect or not satisfied, TEGNA and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel, the Internal Revenue Service could determine on audit that either of the spin-offs are taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings were incorrect or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the share ownership of TEGNA or the spin-off businesses after the separation. If either spin-off were determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, TEGNA and its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. Volatility in the U.S. credit markets could significantly impact our ability to obtain new financing to fund our operations and strategic initiatives or to refinance our existing debt at reasonable rates and terms as it maturesAt December 31, 2018, we had approximately $2.96 billion in debt and approximately $1.44 billion of undrawn additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility that expires in 2023. This debt matures at various times during the years 2019-2027. While our cash flow is expected to be sufficient to pay amounts when due, if our operating results deteriorate significantly, we may not be able to pay amounts when due and a portion of these maturities may need to be refinanced. Access to the capital markets for longer-term financing is generally unpredictable and volatile credit markets could make it harder for us to obtain debt financings.The value of our existing intangible assets may become impaired, depending upon future operating resultsGoodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $4.12 billion at December 31, 2018, representing approximately 78% of our total assets. These assets are subject to annual impairment testing and more frequent testing upon the occurrence of certain events or significant changes in circumstance that indicate all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable in which case a non-cash charge to earnings may be necessary. We may subsequently experience market pressures which could cause future cash flows to decline below our current expectations, or volatile equity markets could negatively impact market factors used in the impairment analysis, including earnings multiples, discount rates, and long-term growth rates. Any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely affect future reported results of operations and shareholders’ equity, although such charges would not affect our cash flow.Our strategic acquisitions, investments and partnerships could pose various risks, increase our leverage and may significantly impact our ability to expand our overall profitabilityAcquisitions involve inherent risks, such as increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures and facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flow and could strain our human resources. We may be unable to successfully implement effective cost controls, achieve expected synergies or increase revenues as a result of an acquisition. Acquisitions may result in us assuming unexpected liabilities and in management diverting its attention from the operation of our business. Acquisitions may result in us having greater exposure to the industry risks of the businesses underlying the acquisition. Strategic investments and partnerships with other companies expose us to the risk that we may be unable to control the operations of our investee or partnership, which could decrease the amount of benefits we realize from a particular relationship. We are exposed to the risk that our partners in strategic investments and infrastructure may encounter financial difficulties which could disrupt investee or partnership activities, or impair assets acquired, which would adversely affect future reported results of operations and shareholders’ equity. The failure to obtain regulatory approvals may prevent us from completing or realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions. Furthermore, acquisitions may subject us to new or different regulations which could have an adverse effect on our operations.14"

RISK FACTORSAn investment in our common stock involves risks and uncertainties and investors should consider carefully the following risk factors before investing in our securities. We seek to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet perceive or that we currently believe are immaterial may adversely affect our business and the trading price of our securities.Changes in economic conditions in the U.S. markets we serve may depress demand for our products and services We generate a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of advertising at our television stations. Expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions, as well as budgeting and buying patterns. As a result, our operating results depend on the relative strength of the economy in our principal television markets as well as the strength or weakness of regional and national economic factors. A decline in economic conditions in the U.S. could have a significant adverse impact on our businesses and could significantly impact all key advertising revenue categories. Competition from alternative forms of media may impair our ability to grow or maintain revenue levels in traditional and new businessesAdvertising and marketing services produces the majority of our revenues, with our stations’ affiliated desktop, mobile and 11tablet advertising revenues being an important component. Technology, particularly new video formats, streaming and downloading capabilities via the Internet, video-on-demand, personal video recorders and other devices and technologies used in the entertainment industry continues to evolve rapidly, leading to alternative methods for the delivery and storage of digital content. These technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior and have empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where and how they consume news and entertainment, including through so-called “cutting the cord” and other consumption strategies. These innovations may affect our ability to generate television audience, which may make our television stations less attractive to both household audiences and advertisers. This competition may make it difficult for us to grow or maintain our revenues.We are dependent on advertising revenues, which, in turn, depend on a number of factors, some of which are cyclical and many of which are beyond our controlIn 2017, 61% of our revenues were derived from television spot and digital advertising. Demand for advertising is highly dependent upon the strength of the U.S. economy, both in the markets our stations serve and in the nation as a whole. During an economic downturn, demand for advertising may decrease. Our advertising revenues can also vary substantially from year to year, driven by the political election cycle (e.g., even years); the ability and willingness of candidates and political action committees to raise and spend funds on television and digital advertising, and the competitive nature of the elections impacting viewers within our stations’ markets. Advertising revenues will also vary based on the coverage of major sporting events (e.g., Olympics and Super Bowl) due to our high concentration of NBC stations.  In addition, shifting viewer preferences could cause our advertising revenues to decline as a result of changes to the ratings of our programming, which may materially negatively affect our business and results of operations.   The value of our assets or operations may be diminished if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or if we are the subject of a data breach or cyber attackOur information technology systems are critically important to operating our business efficiently and effectively. We rely on our information technology systems to manage our business data, communications, news and advertising content, digital products, order entry, fulfillment and other business processes. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, broadcasting disruptions, and loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results to be impacted.Furthermore, attempts to compromise information technology systems occur regularly across many industries and sectors, and we may be vulnerable to security breaches beyond our control. We invest in security resources and technology to protect our data and business processes against risk of data security breaches and cyber-attack, but the techniques used to attempt attacks are constantly changing. A breach or successful attack could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation. We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may be insufficient to cover all of our losses from any future breaches of our systems.As has historically been the case in the broadcast sector, loss of, or changes in, affiliation agreements or retransmission consent agreements could adversely affect operating results for our stations Most of our stations are covered by our network affiliation agreements with the major broadcast television networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox). These television networks produce and distribute programming in exchange for each of our stations’ commitment to air the programming at specified times and for commercial announcement time during the programming. The cost of network affiliation agreements represents a significant portion of our television operating expenses. Each of our affiliation agreements has a stated expiration date (NBC-2021, CBS-2019, ABC-2018, Fox-2019). If renewed, our network affiliation agreements may be renewed on terms that are less favorable to us. The non-renewal or termination of any of our network affiliation agreements would prevent us from being able to carry programming of the affiliate network. This loss of programming would require us to obtain replacement programming, which may involve higher costs and/or which may not be as attractive to our audiences, resulting in reduced revenues. In recent years, the networks have streamed their programming on the Internet and other distribution platforms, in some cases live or within a short period of the original network programming broadcast on local television stations, including those we own. An increase in the availability of network programming on alternative platforms that either bypass or provide less favorable terms to local stations - such as cable channels, the Internet and other distribution vehicles - may dilute the exclusivity and value of network programming originally broadcast by the local stations and could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of our stations.Our retransmission consent agreements with major cable, satellite and telecommunications service providers permit them to retransmit our stations’ signals to their subscribers in exchange for the payment of compensation to us (which we classify as subscription revenues). This source of revenue represented approximately 38% of our 2017 total revenues, and we expect subscription revenues to increase in 2018 and moving forward. As is the case in the broadcast television industry generally, if we 12are unable to renegotiate these agreements on favorable terms, or at all, the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.The spin-off of our Cars.com business and sale of our majority ownership interest in CareerBuilder has reduced the size and diversification of our business, which in turn increases our exposure to the changes and highly competitive environment of the broadcast industry.We now operate as a single business segment which has more broadcast sector concentration. Broadcast companies operate in a highly competitive environment and compete for audiences, advertising and marketing services revenue and quality programing. Lower audience share, declines in advertising and marketing services spending, and increased programming costs would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Congress are contemplating several new laws and changes to existing media ownership and other broadcast-related regulations, regarding a wide range of matters (including permitting companies to own more stations in a single market, as well as owning more stations nationwide).

On September 7, 2016, we announced our intention to spin-off our Cars.com business unit within our Digital Segment. The separation, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2017, is subject to final approval of our Board of Directors. In addition, unanticipated developments, regulatory approvals or clearances and uncertainty in the financial markets, could delay or prevent the completion of the proposed separation or cause the proposed separation to occur on terms or conditions that are different from those currently anticipated. As a result, we cannot assure that we will be able to complete the proposed separation on the terms or the timeline that we announced, if at all. The proposed Cars.com separation may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefitsExecuting the proposed separation of Cars.com will require us to incur costs as well as time and attention from our senior management and key employees, which could distract them from operating our business, disrupt operations, and result in the loss of business opportunities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We may also experience increased difficulties in attracting, retaining and motivating key employees during the pendency of the separation and following its completion, which could harm our business. Even if the proposed separation is completed, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the separation and the separation may in fact adversely affect our business. As independent, publicly traded companies, both TEGNA and Cars.com will be smaller, less diversified companies with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions and competitive pressures, which could materially and adversely affect their respective businesses, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly traded companies following the completion of the proposed separation will be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred.The strategic review of CareerBuilder business unit is subject to various risks and uncertaintiesOn September 7, 2016, we also announced that we will conduct a strategic review of our CareerBuilder business unit within our Digital Segment, including a possible sale. There can be no assurance of the terms, timing or structure of any transaction involving such business, or whether any such transaction will take place at all, and any such transaction is subject to risks and uncertainties.

If the Gannett separation is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, TEGNA and its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. 13Volatility in the U.S. credit markets could significantly impact our ability to obtain new financing to fund our operations and strategic initiatives or to refinance our existing debt at reasonable rates and terms as it maturesAt December 31, 2016, we had approximately $4.08 billion in debt and approximately $844 million of undrawn additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility that expires in 2020. This debt matures at various times during the years 2017-2027. While our cash flow is expected to be sufficient to pay amounts when due, if operating results deteriorate significantly, a portion of these maturities may need to be refinanced. Access to the capital markets for longer-term financing is unpredictable and volatile credit markets could make it harder for us to obtain debt financings generally.Changes in the regulatory environment could encumber or impede our efforts to improve operating results or the value of assetsOur media and digital operations are subject to government regulation. Changing regulations, particularly FCC regulations which affect our television stations, may impair or reduce our leverage in negotiating affiliation or retransmission agreements, adversely affecting our revenues, or result in increased costs, reduced valuations for certain broadcasting properties or other impacts, all of which may adversely impact our future profitability.

The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, late or missed publications, and loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results to be impacted.Furthermore, attempts to compromise information technology systems occur regularly across many industries and sectors, and we may be vulnerable to security breaches beyond our control. We invest in security resources and technology to protect our data and business processes against risk of data security breaches and cyber attack, but the techniques used to attempt attacks are constantly changing. A breach or successful attack could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation. We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may be insufficient to cover all of our losses from any future breaches of our systems.As has historically been the case in the broadcast sector, loss of or changes in affiliation agreements or retransmission consent agreements could adversely affect operating results for our Media Segment’s stations Most of our stations have network affiliation agreements with the major broadcast television networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox). These television networks produce and distribute programming in exchange for each of our stations' commitment to air the programming at specified times and for commercial announcement time during the programming. In most cases, we also make cash payments to the networks. 12Each of our affiliation agreements has a stated expiration date. If renewed, our network affiliation agreements may be renewed on terms that are less favorable to us. The non-renewal or termination of any of our network affiliation agreements would prevent us from being able to carry programming of the affiliate network. This loss of programming would require us to obtain replacement programming, which may involve higher costs and/or which may not be as attractive to our audiences, resulting in reduced revenues. In recent years, the networks have streamed their programming on the Internet and other distribution platforms, in some cases within a short period of the original network programming broadcast on local television stations, including those we own. An increase in the availability of network programming on alternative platforms that either bypass or provide less favorable terms to local stations - such as cable channels, the Internet and other distribution vehicles - may dilute the exclusivity and value of network programming originally broadcast by the local stations and could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of our stations.Our retransmission consent agreements with major cable, satellite and telecommunications service providers permit them to retransmit our stations’ signals to their subscribers in exchange for the payment of compensation to us. As is the case in the broadcast television industry generally, if we are unable to renegotiate these agreements on favorable terms, or at all, the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.There could be significant liability if the spin-off of the publishing businesses is determined to be a taxable transaction We received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the requirements for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code were satisfied. The opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from TEGNA and Gannett regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is incorrect or not satisfied, TEGNA and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel, the Internal Revenue Service could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings were incorrect or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the share ownership of TEGNA or Gannett after the separation. If the separation is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, TEGNA and its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.  Gannett or we may fail to perform under various temporary transaction agreements that were executed as part of the separation or we may fail to have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transaction agreements expireIn connection with the separation, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and also entered into various other agreements, including a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement and an employee matters agreement. The separation and distribution agreement, the tax matters agreement and the employee matters agreement determined the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and includes certain indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations. The transition services agreement provides for the performance of certain services by each company for the benefit of the other for a limited period of time after the separation. We will rely on Gannett to satisfy its performance obligations under these agreements. If Gannett is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, we could incur operational difficulties or losses. If we do not have in place our own systems and services, or if we do not have agreements with other providers of these services once certain transaction agreements expire or terminate, we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our profitability may decline. Volatility in the U.S. credit markets could significantly impact our ability to obtain new financing to fund our operations and strategic initiatives or to refinance our existing debt at reasonable rates as it maturesAt December 31, 2015, we had approximately $4.2 billion in debt and approximately $658 million of undrawn additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility that expires in 2020. This debt matures at various times during the years 2016-2027. While our cash flow is expected to be sufficient to pay amounts when due, if operating results deteriorate significantly, a portion of these maturities may need to be refinanced. Access to the capital markets for longer-term financing is unpredictable, and volatile credit markets could make it harder for us to obtain debt financings generally.Changes in the regulatory environment could encumber or impede our efforts to improve operating results or the value of assetsOur media and digital operations are subject to government regulation. Changing regulations, particularly FCC Regulations which affect our television stations (including changes to our shared services and similar agreements), may result in increased costs, reduced valuations for certain broadcasting properties or other impacts, all of which may adversely impact our future profitability. All of our television stations are required to hold television broadcasting licenses from the FCC; when granted, these licenses are generally granted for a period of eight years. Under certain circumstances, the FCC is not required to renew any license and could decline to renew either our current license applications that are pending or those submitted in the future. 13Our strategic acquisitions, investments and partnerships could pose various risks, increase our leverage and may significantly impact our ability to expand our overall profitabilityAcquisitions involve inherent risks, such as increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures and facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flow and could strain our human resources. We may be unable to successfully implement effective cost controls, achieve expected synergies or increase revenues as a result of an acquisition. Acquisitions may result in us assuming unexpected liabilities and in management diverting its attention from the operation of our business. Disclosures we make regarding past operating results of acquired entities and our pro forma results are based on financial information provided to us by acquired entities, which has not been reviewed by our auditors or subject to our internal controls. Acquisitions may result in us having greater exposure to the industry risks of the businesses underlying the acquisition. Strategic investments and partnerships with other companies expose us to the risk that we may be unable to control the operations of our investee or partnership, which could decrease the amount of benefits we realize from a particular relationship. We are exposed to the risk that our partners in strategic investments and infrastructure may encounter financial difficulties which could disrupt investee or partnership activities, or impair assets acquired, which would adversely affect future reported results of operations and shareholders’ equity. In addition, we may be unable to obtain financing necessary to complete acquisitions on attractive terms or at all. The failure to obtain regulatory approvals may prevent us from completing or realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions. Furthermore, acquisitions may subject us to new or different regulations which could have an adverse effect on our operations.The value of our existing intangible assets may become impaired, depending upon future operating resultsGoodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $6.98 billion at December 31, 2015, representing approximately 82% of our total assets. These assets are subject to annual impairment testing and more frequent testing upon the occurrence of certain events or significant changes in circumstance that indicate all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable. In which case a non-cash charge to earnings may be necessary, as occurred in 2013-2015 (see Notes 3 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements). We may subsequently experience market pressures which could cause future cash flows to decline below our current expectations, or volatile equity markets could negatively impact market factors used in the impairment analysis, including earnings multiples, discount rates, and long-term growth rates. Any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely affect future reported results of operations and shareholders’ equity, although such charges would not affect our cash flow. "

RISK FACTORSIn addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K, prospective investors should consider carefully the following risk factors before investing in our securities. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet perceive or that we currently believe are immaterial may adversely affect our business and the trading price of our securities.Changes in economic conditions in the U.S., U.K. and other international markets we serve may depress demand for our products and servicesOur operating results depend on the relative strength of the economy in our principal television, publishing and digital markets as well as the strength or weakness of regional and national economic factors. A decline in economic conditions in the U.S. and U.K. could have a significant adverse impact on our businesses, particularly publishing, and could significantly impact all key advertising revenue categories.Competition from alternative forms of media may impair our ability to grow or maintain revenue levels in core and new businessesAdvertising produces the predominant share of our broadcasting, publishing and digital revenues, with affiliated web site, mobile and tablet revenues being an important component. With the continued development of alternative forms of media, particularly electronic media including those based on the Internet, our businesses may face increased competition. Alternative media sources may affect our ability to generate circulation revenues and our television audience. New and emerging technologies such as subscription streaming media services and mobile video are increasing competition for household audiences and advertisers. This competition may make it difficult for us to grow or maintain our print advertising, circulation and broadcasting revenues, which we believe will challenge us to expand the contributions of our online and other digital businesses.The proposed separation of our Publishing business from our Broadcasting and Digital businesses is subject to various risks and uncertainties, and may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, if at allOn Aug. 5, 2014, we announced our plan to create two publicly traded companies: one exclusively focused on our Broadcasting and Digital businesses, and the other on our Publishing business. The separation, which is expected to be completed mid-2015, is subject to certain customary conditions, including final approval of our Board of Directors. In addition, unanticipated developments, including possible delays in obtaining various tax opinions or rulings, regulatory approvals or clearances and uncertainty of the financial markets, could delay or prevent the completion of the proposed separation or cause the proposed separation to occur on terms or conditions that are different from those currently expected. As a result, we are unable to assure that we will complete the proposed separation on the terms or the timeline that we announced, if at all. The proposed separation may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefitsExecuting the proposed separation will require us to incur costs as well as time and attention from our senior management and key employees, which could distract them from operating our business, disrupt operations, and result in the loss of business opportunities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We may also experience increased difficulties in attracting, retaining and motivating key employees during the pendency of the separation and following its completion, which could harm our businesses. Even if the proposed separation is completed, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the separation and the separation may in fact adversely affect our business. As independent, publicly traded companies, both companies will be smaller, less diversified companies with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions and competitive pressures, which could materially and adversely affect their respective businesses, financial condition and results of operations. Separating the businesses may also eliminate or reduce synergies that existed before the separation, such as the operation of the digital sites and applications for our Publishing and Broadcasting properties as part of the integrated Gannett digital platform, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of each business. There can be no assurance that the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly traded companies following the completion of the proposed separation will be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred.The value of our assets or operations may be diminished if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or if we are the subject of a data breach or cyber attackOur information technology systems are critically important to operating our business efficiently and effectively. We rely on our information technology systems to manage our business data, communications, news and advertising content, digital products, order entry, fulfillment and other business processes. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, late or missed publications, and loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results to be impacted.  Furthermore, attempts to compromise information technology systems occur regularly across many industries and sectors, and we may be vulnerable to security breaches beyond our control. We invest in security resources and technology to protect our data and business processes against risk of data security breaches and cyber attack, but the techniques used to attempt attacks are constantly changing. A breach or successful attack could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation. We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may be insufficient to cover all of our losses from any future breaches of our systems.20Volatility in the U.S. credit markets could significantly impact our ability to obtain new financing to fund our operations and strategic initiatives or to refinance our existing debt at reasonable rates as it maturesAt the end of 2014, we had approximately $4.5 billion in long-term debt and approximately $625 million of additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities. This debt matures at various times during the years 2015-2027. While our cash flow is expected to be sufficient to pay amounts when due, if operating results deteriorate significantly, a portion of these maturities may need to be refinanced. Access to the capital markets for longer term financing is unpredictable, and volatile credit markets could make it harder for us to obtain debt financings generally.Volatility in global financial markets directly affects the value of our pension plan assets and liabilitiesOur three largest retirement plans, which account for 97% of total pension plan assets, were underfunded as of Dec. 28, 2014, by $728 million on a U.S. GAAP basis. Changes in interest rates and future investment returns can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans.  Foreign exchange variability could adversely affect our consolidated operating resultsWeakening of the British pound-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate could diminish Newsquest’s earnings contribution to consolidated results. Newsquest results for 2014 were translated to U.S. dollars at the average rate of 1.65. If the price of the British pound against the U.S. dollar had been 10% more or less than the actual price, operating income would have increased or decreased approximately 1% in 2014. CareerBuilder, with expanding overseas operations, also has foreign exchange risk but to a significantly lesser degree.Changes in the regulatory environment could encumber or impede our efforts to improve operating results or the value of assetsOur broadcasting, publishing and digital operations are subject to government regulation. Changing regulations, particularly FCC Regulations which affect our television stations (including changes to our shared services and similar agreements), may result in increased costs, reduced valuations for certain broadcasting properties or other impacts, all of which may adversely impact our future profitability. All of our television stations are required to hold television broadcasting licenses from the FCC; when granted, these licenses are generally granted for a period of eight years.

The failure to obtain regulatory approvals may prevent us from completing or realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions. Furthermore, acquisitions may subject us to new or different regulations which could have an adverse effect on our operations.The value of our existing intangible assets may become impaired, depending upon future operating resultsGoodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $7.74 billion at Dec. 28, 2014, representing approximately 69% of our total assets. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable, in which case a non-cash charge to earnings may be necessary, as occurred in 2012-2014 (see Notes 3 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely affect future reported results of operations and shareholders’ equity, although such charges would not affect our cash flow.Adverse results from litigation or governmental investigations can impact our business practices and operating resultsFrom time to time, we are parties to litigation and regulatory, environmental and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies. Adverse outcomes in lawsuits or investigations could result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition as well as our ability to conduct our businesses as they are presently being conducted. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I, Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” contained elsewhere in this report for a description of certain of our pending litigation and regulatory matters and other proceedings with governmental authorities"

Additional risks that we did not yet perceive or that we currently believe are immaterial may also adversely affect our business and the trading price of our securities.Deterioration in economic conditions in the markets we serve in the U.S., U.K. and other international markets we serve may depress demand for our products and servicesOur operating results depend on the relative strength of the economy in our principal television, publishing and digital markets as well as the strength or weakness of national and regional economic factors. Generally soft economic conditions and uneven recoveries in the U.S. and U.K. have had a significant adverse impact on the company’s businesses, particularly publishing. If conditions remain challenging or worsen in the U.S. or U.K. economy, all key advertising revenue categories could be significantly impacted.Competition from alternative forms of media may impair our ability to grow or maintain revenue levels in core and new businessesAdvertising produces the predominant share of our broadcasting, publishing and digital revenues, with affiliated web site, mobile and tablet revenues being an important component. With the continued development of alternative forms of media, particularly electronic media including those based on the Internet, our businesses may face increased competition. Alternative media sources may also affect our ability to generate circulation revenues and our television audience. In addition, new and emerging technologies such as subscription streaming media services and mobile video are increasing competition for household audiences and advertisers.  Services such as Aereo and FilmOn X provide their subscribers with streaming content from television stations, over the Internet.  Litigation is ongoing over the claims of certain broadcasters and networks that such services, which are offered without broadcasters’ consent, violate copyright law.  The Supreme Court has agreed to hear an appeal of the Second Circuit’s decision affirming a district court decision to deny a preliminary injunction against Aereo.This competition may make it difficult for us to grow or maintain our print advertising, circulation and broadcasting revenues, which we believe will challenge us to expand the contributions of our online and other digital businesses.Continued volatility in the U.S. credit markets could significantly impact the company’s ability to obtain new financing to fund its operations and strategic initiatives or to refinance its existing debt at reasonable rates as it maturesAt the end of 2013, the company had approximately $3.7 billion in long-term debt and approximately $1.2 billion of additional borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facilities.  This debt matures at various times during the years 2014-2027. While the company’s cash flow is expected to be sufficient to pay amounts when due, if operating results deteriorate significantly, a portion of these maturities may need to be refinanced.

Changing regulations, particularly FCC Regulations which affect our television stations (including changes to our shared services and similar agreements), may result in increased costs, reduced valuations for certain broadcasting properties or other impacts, all of which may adversely impact our future profitability. For example, the FCC is expected to release an order determining that certain joint sales agreements between stations will be treated as attributable interests and seek comment about shared services agreements and local news agreements, including whether such arrangements should be attributable for purposes of the FCC’s ownership rules.  In addition, the FCC is seeking comment on rules governing a “repacking” of the broadcast spectrum which may require certain stations to move to different channels.  All of our television stations are required to possess television broadcasting licenses from the FCC; when granted, these licenses are generally granted for a period of eight years. Under certain circumstances the FCC is not required to renew any license and could decline to renew either our current license applications that are pending or those submitted in the future.20Our strategic acquisitions, investments and partnerships could pose various risks, increase our leverage and may significantly impact our ability to expand our overall profitabilityAcquisitions involve inherent risks, such as increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures and facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flow and could strain our human resources.

In addition, disclosures we make regarding past operating results of acquired entities and our pro forma results are based on financial information provided to us by acquired entities, which has not been reviewed by our auditors or subject to our internal controls. Acquisitions may also result in us having greater exposure to the industry risks of the businesses underlying the acquisition.  For example, our recent acquisition of Belo escalated our dependency on network affiliation agreements and beneficial retransmission agreements.  Strategic investments and partnerships with other companies expose us to the risk that we may not be able to control the operations of our investee or partnership, which could decrease the amount of benefits we realize from a particular relationship. The company is also exposed to the risk that its partners in strategic investments and infrastructure may encounter financial difficulties which could lead to disruption of investee or partnership activities, or impairment of assets acquired, which would adversely affect future reported results of operations and shareholders’ equity.The value of our existing intangible assets may become impaired, depending upon future operating resultsGoodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $5.27 billion as of Dec. 29, 2013, representing approximately 57% of our total assets. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary, as occurred in 2013 and 2012 (see Notes 3 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

This debt matures at various times during the years 2014-2018. While the company’s cash flow is expected to be sufficient to pay amounts when due, if operating results deteriorate significantly, a portion of these maturities may need to be refinanced. Access to the capital markets may at times be affected by our credit ratings and conditions in the economy. A decline in our corporate credit rating could make future borrowings more expensive, and volatile credit markets could make it harder for us to obtain debt financings generally.  At the end of 2012, the company had approximately $922 million of additional borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facilities. Volatility in global financial markets directly affects the value of our pension plan assets and liabilitiesThe company’s principal U.S. retirement plan, the Gannett Retirement Plan, was underfunded as of Dec. 30, 2012 by $594 million on a U.S. GAAP basis. Various factors, including future investment returns, discount rates and potential pension legislative changes, impact the timing and amount of pension contributions the company may be required to make in the future.

Changing regulations, particularly FCC regulations which affect our television stations, may result in increased costs and adversely impact our future profitability. For example, FCC regulations required us to construct digital television stations in all of our television markets, despite the fact that the new digital stations did not produce significant additional revenue. In addition, our television stations are required to possess television broadcast licenses from the FCC; when granted, these licenses are generally granted for a period of eight years. Under certain circumstances the FCC is not required to renew any license and could decline to renew either our current license applications that are pending or those submitted in the future.The degree of success of our investment and acquisition strategy may significantly impact our ability to expand overall profitabilityWe will continue efforts to identify and complete strategic investments, partnerships and business acquisitions. These efforts may not prove successful. Strategic investments and partnerships with other companies expose us to the risk that we may not be able to control the operations of our investee or partnership, which could decrease the amount of benefits we reap from a particular relationship. The company is also exposed to the risk that its partners in strategic investments and infrastructure may encounter financial difficulties which could lead to disruption of investee or partnership activities, or impairment of assets acquired, which would adversely affect future reported results of operations and shareholders' equity.Acquisitions of other businesses may be difficult to integrate with our existing operations, could require an inefficiently high amount of attention from our senior management, might require us to incur additional debt or divert our capital from more profitable expenditures, and might result in other unanticipated problems and liabilities. 24The value of our existing intangible assets may become impaired, depending upon future operating resultsGoodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $3.3 billion as of Dec. 30, 2012, representing approximately 52% of our total assets. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary, as occurred in 2010 and 2012 (see Notes 3 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Furthermore, attempts to compromise information technology systems occur regularly, and we may be vulnerable to security breaches beyond our control.  We invest in security resources and technology to protect our data and business processes against risk of data security breaches and cyber attack, but the techniques used to attempt attacks are constantly changing.  A breach or successful attack could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation"
14,TGNA,TEGNA INC,2011-02-23,"ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORSIn addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K,prospective investors should consider carefully the following risk factors before investing in oursecurities. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that wedo not yet perceive or that we currently believe are immaterial may also adversely affect ourbusiness and the trading price of our securities.Deterioration in economic conditions in the markets we serve in the U.S. and the UK may depressdemand for our products and servicesOur operating results depend on the relative strength of the economy in our principal publishing,digital and television markets as well as the strength or weakness of national and regionaleconomic factors. Generally soft economic conditions and uneven recoveries in the U.S. and U.K.have had a significant adverse impact on the companys businesses, particularly publishing. Ifconditions remain challenging or worsen in the U.S. or U.K. economy, all key advertising revenuecategories could be significantly impacted.Competition from alternative forms of media may impair our ability to grow or maintain revenuelevels in core and new businessesAdvertising produces the predominant share of our publishing, broadcasting and affiliated web siterevenues as well as digital segment revenues. With the continued development of alternative formsof media, particularly electronic media including those based on the Internet, our businesses mayface increased competition. Alternative media sources may also affect our ability to generatecirculation revenues and television audience. This competition may make it difficult for us to growor maintain our broadcasting, print advertising and circulation revenues, which we believe willchallenge us to expand the contributions of our online and other digital businesses.A decline in the companys credit ratings and continued volatility in the U.S. credit markets couldsignificantly impact the companys ability to obtain new financing to fund its operations andstrategic initiatives or to refinance its existing debt at reasonable rates as it maturesAt the end of 2010, the company had approximately $2.35 billion in long-term debt, of which $221million was in the form of borrowings under bank credit facilities, $180 million is a term loan andthe balance was in the form of unsecured notes. Approximately $613 million of this debt maturesbeginning in mid-2011 with remaining maturities in 2012-2018. While the companys cash flow isexpected to be sufficient to pay amounts when due, if operating results deteriorate significantly,a significant portion of these maturities may need to be refinanced. Access to the capital marketsmay at times be affected by our credit ratings and conditions in the economy. A decline in ourcorporate credit rating could make future borrowings more expensive, and volatile credit marketscould make it harder for us to obtain debt financings generally. However, the company did accessthe capital markets in September 2010 with $500 million of unsecured financing. In September, thecompany also amended its revolving credit agreements and extended the maturity date with themajority of itslenders from March 15, 2012 to September 30, 2014. Total commitments under the amended revolvingcredit agreements are $1.63 billion through March 15, 2012 and total extended commitments fromMarch 15, 2012 to September 30, 2014 will be $1.14 billion. At the end of 2010, the company hadapproximately $1.4 billion of additional borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facilities.Volatility in global financial markets directly affects the value of our pension plan assetsWhile asset returns were strongly positive in 2010 and 2009, the companys principal U.S.retirement plan, the Gannett Retirement Plan, is underfunded by $346 million. Depending on variousfactors, including future investment returns, discount rates and potential pension legislativechanges, the company may be required to make up this underfunding with contributions in futureyears.Foreign exchange variability could adversely affect our consolidated operating resultsWeakening of the British pound-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate could diminish Newsquests earningscontribution to consolidated results. Newsquest results for 2010 were translated to U.S. dollars atthe average rate of 1.55. CareerBuilder, with expanding overseas operations, also has foreignexchange risk but to a significantly lesser degree.Changes in the regulatory environment could encumber or impede our efforts to improve operatingresults or value of assetsOur publishing and broadcasting operations are subject to government regulation. Changingregulations, particularly FCC regulations which affect our television stations, may result inincreased costs and adversely impact our future profitability. For example, FCC regulationsrequired us to construct digital television stations in all of our television markets, despite thefact that the new digital stations are unlikely to produce significant additional revenue. Inaddition, our television stations are required to possess television broadcast licenses from theFCC; when granted, these licenses are generally granted for a period of eight years. Under certaincircumstances the FCC is not required to renew any license and could decline to renew our licenseapplications that are currently pending in 2011.The degree of success of our investment and acquisition strategy may significantly impact ourability to expand overall profitabilityWe will continue efforts to identify and complete strategic investments, partnerships and businessacquisitions. These efforts may not prove successful. Strategic investments and partnerships withother companies expose us to the risk that we may not be able to control the operations of ourinvestee or partnership, which could decrease the amount of benefits we reap from a particularrelationship. The company is also exposed to the risk that its partners in strategic investmentsand infrastructure may encounter financial difficulties which could lead to disruption of investeeor partnership activities.Acquisitions of other businesses may be difficult to integrate with our existing operations,could require an inefficiently high amount of attention from our senior management, might requireus to incur additional debt or divert our capital from more profitable expenditures, and mightresult in other unanticipated problems and liabilities. 24Table of ContentsThe value of our intangible assets may become impaired, depending upon future operating resultsGoodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $3.4 billion as of Dec. 26, 2010,representing approximately 49% of our total assets. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and otherintangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer berecoverable, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary, as occurred in the last threeyears (see Notes 3 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Any future evaluationsrequiring an asset impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely affectfuture reported results of operations and shareholders equity, although such charges would notaffect our cash flow.The collectability of accounts receivable under current soft economic conditions could deteriorateto a greater extent than provided for in the companys financial statements and in its projectionsof future resultsGenerally soft economic conditions and uneven recoveries in the U.S. and U.K. have increased thecompanys exposure to losses resulting from the potential bankruptcy of its advertising customers.The companys accounts receivable are stated at net estimated realizable value and its allowancefor doubtful accounts has been determined based on several factors, including receivable agings,significant individual credit risk accounts and historical experience. If such collectabilityestimates prove inaccurate, adjustments to future operating results could occur"

This debt matures in part in 2009, 2011 and2012. While the companys cash flow permits us to lower the amount of this debt before it matures,a significant portion of it may need to be refinanced. Access to the capital markets forlonger-term financing is currently restricted due to the unprecedented and ongoing turmoil in thecapital markets. At the end of 2008, the company had approximately $1.2 billion of additionalborrowing capacity under its revolving credit facilities, providing near-term liquidity to fund itsneeds and to repay debt maturing in 2009 and beyond.Volatility in U.S. and U.K. financial markets directly affects the value of our pension planassetsBecause of volatility and sharp declines in global financial markets, the companys pensionplan asset values declined significantly in 2008 and the companys principal U.S. retirement plan,the Gannett Retirement Plan, is underfunded. These 2008 investment losses will result in higherpension costs in 2009.
