5,BMI,BADGER METER INC,2024-02-16,"ITEM 1A.	RISK FACTORSShareholders, potential investors and other readers are urged to consider the significant business risks described below in addition to the other information set forth or incorporated by reference in this 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the “Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements” at the front of this 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  If any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occur, our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  The following list of risk factors may not be exhaustive.  We operate in a continually changing business, economic and geopolitical environment, and new risk factors may emerge from time to time.  We can neither predict these new risk factors with certainty nor assess the precise impact, if any, on our business, or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may adversely impact our results of operations.  While there is much uncertainty, we do analyze the risks we face, perform a probability assessment of their impacts and attempt to soften their potential impact when and if possible.PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICESThe inability to develop technologically advanced products and solutions could harm our future success.We believe our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards.  Although we believe that we currently have a competitive advantage in this area, maintaining such advantage will require continued investment in research and development, sales, marketing and manufacturing capabilities.  There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments or that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantage.  If we are unable to maintain our competitive advantage, our future financial performance may be adversely affected.  We are not currently aware of any emerging standards, technologies or 11  new products that could render our existing products obsolete in the near term.  Our radios operate on networks which are changing as part of the natural evolution of technology.  The pace of that change is largely outside of the Company’s control and the sun-setting of a network may have an adverse impact on the Company, however, we have strong relationships with telecommunication providers that assist in mitigating this risk.  The municipal water industry is continuing to see the adoption of static water meters.  Static water metering has lower barriers to entry than mechanical metering that could affect the competitive landscape in North America.  We believe we have a competitive product and market position. If the adoption rate for static meters were to accelerate, we believe competitors lack brand recognition and product breadth and do not have extensive water utility channel distribution to effectively reach the more than 50,000 water utilities in the United States.Failure to manufacture quality products could have a material adverse effect on our business.If we fail to maintain and enforce quality control and testing procedures, our products will not meet required performance standards.  Our products have an extended expected life and we therefore offer extended duration warranty coverages.  Product quality and performance are a priority for us since our products are used in various applications where precise control of fluids is essential.  Although we believe our products are perceived as high quality, any future production and/or sale of substandard products could seriously harm our reputation, resulting in both a loss of current customers to competitors and damage to our ability to attract new customers.  In addition, if any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products or incur warranty related expenses.  A successful claim brought against us with respect to a defective product in excess of available insurance coverage, if any, or a requirement to participate in a major product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.If our software products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected.We sell software products, including cloud-based solutions, that may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications when used with other technologies utilized by the customer.  A failure of our software products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products or a failure or breach of a cloud network could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Our role as a prime contractor brings certain risks that could have a material adverse effect to our business.We periodically assume the role of prime contractor for providing complete technology systems, installation and other services and project management to customers and governmental entities, which brings with it added risks, including but not limited to, our responsibility for managing subcontractor performance and project timelines and the potential for expanded warranty and performance obligations.  While we routinely manage these types of arrangements, it is possible to encounter a situation where we may not be able to perform to the expectations of the customer or governmental entity, and thus incur additional costs that could affect our profitability or harm our reputation.If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our software and related products, our ability to market our software products could be hindered and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights.  These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information.  In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and software products and other components may increasingly be subject to third-party infringement claims.  Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.12  BUSINESS CONDITIONSThe inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and component parts at reasonable prices could decrease our profit margins and negatively impact timely delivery to customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are affected by the availability and prices for raw materials and component parts, including purchased castings made of metal or alloys (such as brass, which uses copper as its main component, aluminum, stainless steel and cast iron), plastic resins, microprocessors and other electronic subassemblies, and components that are used in the manufacturing process.  Further, supply chain disruptions and challenges may be caused by a number of factors affecting our suppliers, including, but not limited to, capacity constraints, port congestion, labor disputes or unrest, labor shortages and costs, economic downturns, availability of credit, a high interest rate environment, impaired financial condition, sanctions/tariffs, energy inflation/availability and geopolitical risks (such as the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East). The effects of climate change, including extreme weather events, may exacerbate these risks. The inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and component parts for our products at reasonable prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations by decreasing profit margins and by negatively impacting timely deliveries to customers.  In the past, we have been able to offset price increases in raw materials and component parts by increased sales prices, active materials management, product engineering programs and the diversity of materials used in the production processes.  However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to accomplish this in the future.  Since we do not control the actual production of these raw materials and component parts, there may be continued delays in the production or transportation of these materials for reasons that are beyond our control.  World commodity markets and inflationary environments may affect raw material and component part prices. In addition, we rely on single suppliers for microprocessors, castings and components in several of our product lines and the loss of such suppliers could temporarily disrupt operations in the short term.  Global public health pandemics could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Global health pandemics and related containment measures taken by federal and state governments could result in business slowdowns or shutdowns, weakened economic conditions, economic uncertainty, and volatility in the financial markets and could interfere with the ability of our employees, suppliers, and customers to perform our and their respective responsibilities and obligations relative to the conduct of our business and operations.The extent to which future pandemics impact our business operations in future periods will depend on multiple factors that cannot be accurately predicated at this time, such as the duration and scope of any pandemic, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, the disruption caused by such actions, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, suppliers and customers. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and overall financial performance. Economic conditions could cause a material adverse impact on our sales and operating results.As a supplier of products and software, the majority of which are to water utilities, we may be adversely affected by global economic conditions, rising interest rates, delays in governmental programs created to stimulate the economy, and the impact of government budget cuts or partial shutdowns of governmental operations that affect our customers, including independent distributors, large city utilities, public and private water companies and numerous smaller water utilities.  These customers may delay capital projects, including non-critical maintenance and upgrades, or may not have the ability to authorize and finance purchases during economic downturns, instability in world markets, and a higher interest rate environment.  We also sell products for other applications to reduce our dependency on the municipal water market.  A significant downturn in this market could cause a material adverse impact on sales and operating results.  Therefore, a downturn in general economic conditions, as well as in the municipal water market, rising interest rates, delays in the timing or amounts of possible annual federal funding, government budget cuts or partial shutdowns of governmental operations, or the availability of funds to municipalities could result in a reduction in demand for our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and overall financial performance.13  Geopolitical crisis, including terrorism or pandemics, could adversely affect our business.Our operations are susceptible to global events, including acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, political instability, and a widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business results and financial condition. Risks related to foreign markets could decrease our profitability.Since we sell products worldwide as well as manufacture products in several countries, we are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally.  These risks include such things as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including the effect of a strong or weak U.S. dollar, changes in political or economic conditions of specific countries or regions, potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws or regulatory requirements, differing labor regulations, and the difficulty of managing widespread operations.An inability to attract and retain skilled employees could negatively impact our growth and decrease our profitability.Our success depends on our continued ability to identify, attract, develop and retain skilled personnel throughout our organization.  Current and future compensation arrangements, including benefits, may not be sufficient to attract new employees or retain existing employees, which may hinder our growth. Increased labor competition from accelerated retirements, wage inflation and scarcity of labor may negatively impact costs and negatively impact employee engagement, productivity and efficiency.Competitive pressures in the marketplace could decrease our revenues and profits.Competitive pressures in the marketplace for our products could adversely affect our competitive position, leading to a possible loss of market share or a decrease in prices, either of which could result in decreased revenues and profits.  We operate in an environment where competition varies from moderate to strong and a number of our competitors have greater financial resources.  The principal elements of competition for our most significant product applications, residential and commercial water meters for the municipal water utility market (with various radio technology systems), are price, product technology, quality and service.  The competitive environment is also affected by the movement toward radio technologies and away from manually read meters, the demand for replacement units and, to some extent, such things as global economic conditions, the timing and size of governmental programs such as stimulus programs, the ability of municipal water utility customers to authorize and finance purchases of our products, our ability to obtain financing, housing starts in the United States, and overall economic activity.  For our flow instrumentation products, the competitive environment is affected by the general economic health of various industrial sectors particularly in the United States and Europe.GOVERNMENT REGULATION Violations or alleged violations of laws that impose requirements for the conduct of the Company’s overseas operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or other anti-corruption laws, trade sanctions and sanctioned parties restrictions could adversely affect our business.In foreign countries where we operate, a risk exists that our employees, third party partners or agents could engage in business practices prohibited by applicable laws and regulations, such as the FCPA.  Such anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies from making improper payments to foreign officials, require companies to keep accurate books and records, and maintain appropriate internal controls.  Our policies mandate strict compliance with such laws and we devote resources to ensure compliance.  However, we operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption, and, in certain circumstances, local customs and practice might not be consistent with the requirements of anti-corruption laws.  We remain subject to the risk that our employees, third party partners or agents will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and violate such laws and regulations.  Violations by us or a third party acting on our behalf could result in significant internal investigation costs and legal fees, civil and criminal penalties, including prohibitions on the conduct of our business and reputational harm.We may also be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we violate U.S. trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the European Union, the United Nations and trade sanction laws, such as the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 or Russian and Belarus Financial Sanctions Act of 2022.  Our policies mandate strict compliance with such laws and we devote resources to ensure compliance.Changes in environmental or regulatory requirements, including climate change legislation, could entail additional expenses that could decrease our profitability.We are subject to a variety of laws in various countries and markets, such as those regulating lead or other material content in certain of our products, the handling, recycling and disposal of certain electronic and other materials, the use and/or licensing of radio 14  frequencies necessary for radio products, data privacy and protection, as well as customs and trade practices.  We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future environmental or regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing or future laws will be administered or interpreted.  Currently, the cost of complying with existing laws is included as part of our on-going expenses and does not have a material effect on our business or financial position, but a change in the future could adversely affect our profitability.Concern over climate change has resulted in, and could continue to result in, new legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We may become subject to additional legislation, regulations or accords regarding climate change, and compliance with any new rules could be difficult and costly, as a result of increased energy, environmental and other costs and capital expenditures. Our failure to successfully comply with any such legislation, regulation, or accord could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and overall financial performance. GENERALEconomic impacts due to leadership or policy changes in the countries where we do business could negatively affect our profitability.We may be affected by adjustments to economic and trade policies, such as taxation, changes to or withdrawal from international trade agreements, or the like, when countries where we produce or sell our products change leadership or economic policies.  These types of changes, as well as any related regulatory changes, could significantly increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.Climate change, extreme weather and other natural phenomena could adversely affect our business.Climate changes and weather conditions may affect, or cause volatility in, our financial results.  Drought conditions could drive higher demand for smart water solutions that advance conservation efforts in residential and commercial applications.  Our sales also may be adversely affected by unusual weather, weather patterns or other natural phenomena that could have an impact on the timing of orders in given periods, depending on the particular mix of customers being served by us at the time. The unpredictable nature of weather conditions and climate change therefore may result in volatility for certain portions of our business, as well as the operations of certain of our customers and suppliers.Failure to meet ESG expectations or standards, or to achieve our ESG goals, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and overall financial performance.In recent years, there has been an increased focus from stakeholders on ESG matters, including GHG emissions and climate-related risks, renewable energy, water stewardship, waste management, diversity, equity and inclusion, responsible sourcing and supply chain, human rights and social responsibility. Given our commitment to certain ESG principles, we actively manage these issues and have established certain goals, commitments and targets. These goals, commitments and targets reflect our current plans and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Evolving stakeholder expectations and our efforts to manage these issues, report on them and accomplish our goals present numerous operational, regulatory, reputational, financial, legal and other risks, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.Litigation against us could be costly, time consuming to defend and could adversely affect our profitability.From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.  For example, we may be subject to workers' compensation claims, employment/labor disputes, customer and supplier disputes, product liability claims, intellectual property disputes and contractual disputes related to warranties arising out of the conduct of our business.  Litigation may result in substantial costs and may divert management's attention and resources, which could adversely affect our profitability or financial condition.Disruptions and other damages to our information technology and other networks and operations, and breaches in data security or cybersecurity attacks could have a negative financial impact and damage our reputation.Our ability to serve customers, as well as increase revenues and control costs, depends in part on the reliability of our sophisticated technologies, system networks and cloud-based software.  We use information technology and other systems to manage our business in order to maximize our revenue, effectiveness and efficiency.  Unauthorized parties gaining access to digital systems and networks for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive financial, personal or business information, corrupting data, causing operational disruptions and other cyber-related risks could adversely impact our customer relationships, business plans and our reputation.  In some cases, we are dependent on third-party technologies and service providers for which there is no certainty of 15  uninterrupted availability or through which hackers could gain access to sensitive and/or personal information.  These potential disruptions and cyber-attacks could negatively affect revenues, costs, customer demand, system availability and our reputation. Further, as the Company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue newer technologies that improve our operations and cost structure, the Company is also expanding and improving its information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk.  Certain new technologies present new and significant cybersecurity safety risks that must be analyzed and addressed before implementation.  If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks.Failure to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquired businesses or products could adversely affect our operations.As part of our business strategy, we continue to evaluate and may pursue selected business or product acquisition opportunities that we believe may provide us with certain operating and financial benefits.  There can be no assurance that we will identify or complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future.  If we complete any such acquisitions, they may require integration into our existing business with respect to administrative, financial, legal, sales, marketing, manufacturing and other functions to realize these anticipated benefits.  If we are unable to successfully integrate a business or product acquisition, we may not realize the benefits identified in our due diligence process, and our financial results may be negatively impacted.  Additionally, significant unexpected liabilities may arise during or after completion of an acquisition"

Litigation may result in substantial costs and may divert management's attention and resources, which could adversely affect our profitability or financial condition.Disruptions and other damages to our information technology and other networks and operations, and breaches in data security or cybersecurity attacks could have a negative financial impact and damage our reputation.Our ability to serve customers, as well as increase revenues and control costs, depends in part on the reliability of our sophisticated technologies, system networks and cloud-based software.  We use information technology and other systems to manage our business in order to maximize our revenue, effectiveness and efficiency.  Unauthorized parties gaining access to digital systems and networks for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive financial, personal or business information, corrupting data, causing operational disruptions and other cyber-related risks could adversely impact our customer relationships, business plans and our reputation.  In some cases, we are dependent on third-party technologies and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability or through which hackers could gain access to sensitive and/or personal information.  These potential disruptions and cyber-attacks could negatively affect revenues, costs, customer demand, system availability and our reputation. Further, as the Company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue newer technologies that improve our operations and cost structure, the Company is also expanding and improving its information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk.  Certain new technologies present new and significant cybersecurity safety risks that must be analyzed and addressed before implementation.  If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks.Failure to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquired businesses or products could adversely affect our operations.As part of our business strategy, we continue to evaluate and may pursue selected business or product acquisition opportunities that we believe may provide us with certain operating and financial benefits.  There can be no assurance that we will 15  identify or complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future.  If we complete any such acquisitions, they may require integration into our existing business with respect to administrative, financial, legal, sales, marketing, manufacturing and other functions to realize these anticipated benefits.  If we are unable to successfully integrate a business or product acquisition, we may not realize the benefits identified in our due diligence process, and our financial results may be negatively impacted.  Additionally, significant unexpected liabilities may arise during or after completion of an acquisition"
11,BMI,BADGER METER INC,2022-02-23,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSShareholders, potential investors and other readers are urged to consider the significant business risks described below in addition to the other information set forth or incorporated by reference in this 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the “Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements” at the front of this 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  If any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occur, our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  The following list of risk factors may not be exhaustive.  We operate in a continually changing business, economic and geopolitical environment, and new risk factors may emerge from time to time.  We can neither predict these new risk factors with certainty nor assess the precise impact, if any, on our business, or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may adversely impact our results of operations.  While there is much uncertainty, we do analyze the risks we face, perform a probability assessment of their impacts and attempt to soften their potential impact when and if possible.PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICESThe inability to develop technologically advanced products could harm our future success.We believe our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards.  Although we believe that we currently have a competitive advantage in this area, maintaining such advantage will require continued investment in research and development, sales, marketing and manufacturing capabilities.  There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments or that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantage.  If we are unable to maintain our competitive advantage, our future financial performance may be adversely affected.  We are not currently aware of any emerging standards, technologies or new products that could render our existing products obsolete in the near term.  Our radios operate on networks which are changing as part of the natural evolution of technology.  The pace of that change is largely outside of the Company’s control and the sun-setting of a network may have an adverse impact on the Company.  The municipal water industry is continuing to see the adoption of static water meters.  Static water metering has lower barriers to entry that could affect the competitive landscape in North America.  We believe we have a competitive product. If the adoption rate for static meters were to accelerate, we believe competitors lack brand recognition and product breadth and do not have extensive water utility channel distribution to effectively reach the more than 50,000 water utilities in the United States.Failure to manufacture quality products could have a material adverse effect on our business.If we fail to maintain and enforce quality control and testing procedures, our products will not meet required performance standards.  Our products have an extended expected life and we offer long warranty coverages.  Product quality and performance are a priority for us since our products are used in various applications where precise control of fluids is essential.  Although we believe our products are perceived as high quality, any future production and/or sale of substandard products could seriously harm our reputation, resulting in both a loss of current customers to competitors and damage to our ability to attract new customers.  In addition, if any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products or incur warranty related expenses.  A successful claim brought against us with respect to a defective product in excess of available insurance coverage, if any, or a requirement to participate in a major product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.If our software products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected.We sell software products, including some that are provided in “the cloud,” that may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications when used with other technologies utilized by the customer.  A failure of our software products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products or a failure or breach of a cloud network could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Our expanded role as a prime contractor brings certain risks that could have a material adverse effect to our business.The Company periodically assumes the role of prime contractor for providing complete technology systems, installation and other services and project management to governmental entities, which brings with it added risks, including but not limited to, our responsibility for managing subcontractor performance and project timelines and the potential for expanded warranty and performance obligations.  While we routinely manage these types of arrangements, it is possible to encounter a situation where we may not be able to perform to the expectations of the governmental entity, and thus incur additional costs that could affect our profitability or harm our reputation.9 If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our software and related products, our ability to market our software products could be hindered and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights.  These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information.  In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and software products and other components may increasingly be subject to third-party infringement claims.  Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.BUSINESS CONDITIONSThe inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and component parts at favorable prices could decrease our profit margins and negatively impact timely delivery to customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are affected by the availability and prices for raw materials and component parts, including purchased castings made of metal or alloys (such as brass, which uses copper as its main component, aluminum, stainless steel and cast iron), plastic resins, microprocessors and other electronic subassemblies, and components that are used in the manufacturing process, and we are experiencing supply chain disruptions and related challenges throughout the supply chain.  The inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and component parts for our products at favorable prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations by decreasing profit margins and by negatively impacting timely deliveries to customers.  In the past, we have been able to offset price increases in raw materials and component parts by increased sales prices, active materials management, product engineering programs and the diversity of materials used in the production processes.  However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to accomplish this in the future.  Since we do not control the actual production of these raw materials and component parts, there may be continued delays in the production or transportation of these materials for reasons that are beyond our control.  World commodity markets and the ongoing inflationary environment are affecting, and may continue to affect, raw material and component part prices. In addition, we rely on single suppliers for microprocessors, castings and components in several of our product lines and the loss of such suppliers could temporarily disrupt operations in the short term.   The global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, or other global public health pandemics, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The COVID-19 pandemic, or other global health pandemics, and virus containment measures taken by federal and state governments have resulted in, and could in the future, result in, business slowdowns or shutdowns, weakened economic conditions, economic uncertainty, and volatility in the financial markets and could interfere with the ability of our employees, suppliers, and customers to perform our and their respective responsibilities and obligations relative to the conduct of our business and operations.The extent to which the COVID-19 or any future pandemic impacts our business operations in future periods will depend on multiple factors that cannot be accurately predicated at this time, such as the duration and scope of any pandemic, future spikes of infections (including the spread of variants or mutant strains, and the degree of transmissibility and severity thereof), the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, the disruption caused by such actions, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, suppliers and customers. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and overall financial performance.  Economic conditions could cause a material adverse impact on our sales and operating results.As a supplier of products and software, the majority of which are to water utilities, we may be adversely affected by global economic conditions, delays in governmental programs created to stimulate the economy, and the impact of government budget cuts or partial shutdowns of governmental operations that affect our customers, including independent distributors, large city utilities, public and private water companies and numerous smaller water utilities.  These customers may delay capital projects, including non-critical maintenance and upgrades, or may not have the ability to authorize and finance purchases during economic downturns or instability in world markets.  We also sell products for other applications to reduce our dependency on the municipal water market.  A significant downturn in this market could cause a material adverse impact on sales and operating results.  Therefore, a downturn in general economic conditions, as well as in the municipal water market, and delays in the timing or amounts of possible annual federal funding and periodic stimulus fund programs, government budget cuts or partial shutdowns of governmental operations, or the availability of funds to municipalities could result in a reduction in demand for our products and services and could harm the business.10 Geopolitical crisis, including terrorism or pandemics, could adversely affect our business.Our operations are susceptible to global events, including acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, political instability, and widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business results and financial condition.  See the separate risk factor specific to the global COVID-19 pandemic.Risks related to foreign markets could decrease our profitability.Since we sell products worldwide as well as manufacture products in several countries, we are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally.  These risks include such things as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in political or economic conditions of specific countries or regions, potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws or regulatory requirements, differing labor regulations, and the difficulty of managing widespread operations.An inability to attract and retain skilled employees could negatively impact our growth and decrease our profitability.Our success depends on our continued ability to identify, attract, develop and retain skilled personnel throughout our organization.  Current and future compensation arrangements, including benefits, may not be sufficient to attract new employees or retain existing employees, which may hinder our growth. Increased labor competition from accelerated retirements, wage inflation and scarcity of labor may negatively impact costs and negatively impact employee engagement, productivity and efficiency.Competitive pressures in the marketplace could decrease our revenues and profits.Competitive pressures in the marketplace for our products could adversely affect our competitive position, leading to a possible loss of market share or a decrease in prices, either of which could result in decreased revenues and profits.  We operate in an environment where competition varies from moderate to strong and a number of our competitors have greater financial resources.  Our competitors also include alliance partners that sell products that do or may compete with our products.  The principal elements of competition for our most significant product applications, residential and commercial water meters for the municipal water utility market (with various radio technology systems), are price, product technology, quality and service.  The competitive environment is also affected by the movement toward radio technologies and away from manually read meters, the demand for replacement units and, to some extent, such things as global economic conditions, the timing and size of governmental programs such as stimulus programs, the ability of municipal water utility customers to authorize and finance purchases of our products, our ability to obtain financing, housing starts in the United States, and overall economic activity.  For our flow instrumentation products, the competitive environment is affected by the general economic health of various industrial sectors particularly in the United States and Europe.GOVERNMENT REGULATION Violations or alleged violations of laws that impose requirements for the conduct of the Company’s overseas operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or other anti-corruption laws, trade sanctions and sanctioned parties restrictions could adversely affect our business.In foreign countries where we operate, a risk exists that our employees, third party partners or agents could engage in business practices prohibited by applicable laws and regulations, such as the FCPA.  Such anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies from making improper payments to foreign officials, require companies to keep accurate books and records, and maintain appropriate internal controls.  Our policies mandate strict compliance with such laws and we devote resources to ensure compliance.  However, we operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption, and, in certain circumstances, local customs and practice might not be consistent with the requirements of anti-corruption laws.  We remain subject to the risk that our employees, third party partners or agents will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and violate such laws and regulations.  Violations by us or a third party acting on our behalf could result in significant internal investigation costs and legal fees, civil and criminal penalties, including prohibitions on the conduct of our business and reputational harm.We may also be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we violate U.S. trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the European Union, the United Nations and trade sanction laws, such as the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012.  Our policies mandate strict compliance with such laws and we devote resources to ensure compliance.Changes in environmental or regulatory requirements could entail additional expenses that could decrease our profitability.We are subject to a variety of laws in various countries and markets, such as those regulating lead or other material content in certain of our products, the handling, recycling and disposal of certain electronic and other materials, the use and/or licensing of radio frequencies necessary for radio products, data privacy and protection, as well as customs and trade practices.  We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future environmental or regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing or future laws will be administered or interpreted.  Currently, the cost of complying with existing laws is included as 11 part of our on-going expenses and does not have a material effect on our business or financial position, but a change in the future could adversely affect our profitability.GENERALEconomic impacts due to leadership or policy changes in the countries where we do business could negatively affect our profitability.We may be affected by adjustments to economic and trade policies, such as taxation, changes to or withdrawal from international trade agreements, or the like, when countries where we produce or sell our products change leadership or economic policies.  These types of changes, as well as any related regulatory changes, could significantly increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.Climate change, unusual weather and other natural phenomena could adversely affect our business.Climate changes and weather conditions may affect, or cause volatility in, our financial results.  Drought conditions could drive higher demand for smart water solutions that advance conservation efforts in residential and commercial applications.  Our sales also may be adversely affected by unusual weather, weather patterns or other natural phenomena that could have an impact on the timing of orders in given periods, depending on the particular mix of customers being served by us at the time. The unpredictable nature of weather conditions and climate change therefore may result in volatility for certain portions of our business, as well as the operations of certain of our customers and suppliers.Litigation against us could be costly, time consuming to defend and could adversely affect our profitability.From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.  For example, we may be subject to workers' compensation claims, employment/labor disputes, customer and supplier disputes, product liability claims, intellectual property disputes and contractual disputes related to warranties arising out of the conduct of our business.  Litigation may result in substantial costs and may divert management's attention and resources, which could adversely affect our profitability or financial condition.Disruptions and other damages to our information technology and other networks and operations, and breaches in data security or cybersecurity attacks could have a negative financial impact and damage our reputation.Our ability to serve customers, as well as increase revenues and control costs, depends in part on the reliability of our sophisticated technologies, system networks and cloud-based software.  We use information technology and other systems to manage our business in order to maximize our revenue, effectiveness and efficiency.  Unauthorized parties gaining access to digital systems and networks for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive financial, personal or business information, corrupting data, causing operational disruptions and other cyber-related risks could adversely impact our customer relationships, business plans and our reputation.  In some cases, we are dependent on third-party technologies and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability or through which hackers could gain access to sensitive and/or personal information.  These potential disruptions and cyber-attacks could negatively affect revenues, costs, customer demand, system availability and our reputation. Further, as the Company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue newer technologies that improve our operations and cost structure, the Company is also expanding and improving its information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk.  Certain new technologies present new and significant cybersecurity safety risks that must be analyzed and addressed before implementation.  If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks.Failure to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquired businesses or products could adversely affect our operations.As part of our business strategy, we continue to evaluate and may pursue selected business or product acquisition opportunities that we believe may provide us with certain operating and financial benefits.  There can be no assurance that we will identify or complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future.  If we complete any such acquisitions, they may require integration into our existing business with respect to administrative, financial, legal, sales, marketing, manufacturing and other functions to realize these anticipated benefits.  If we are unable to successfully integrate a business or product acquisition, we may not realize the benefits identified in our due diligence process, and our financial results may be negatively impacted.  Additionally, significant unexpected liabilities may arise during or after completion of an acquisition.12 "

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted economic activity and markets around the world, and it could have a material negative impact on our business and operations in numerous ways, including but not limited to those outlined below:  •The risk that we, or our employees, suppliers or customers may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities.  •Restrictions on shipping products from certain jurisdictions where they are produced or into certain jurisdictions where customers are located.  •Inability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets due to disruptions in our manufacturing and supply arrangements caused by the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing and supply elements, such as raw materials or other finished product components, transportation, workforce or other manufacturing and distribution capability.  •Failure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, distributors, contractors and commercial banks, to meet their obligations to the Company, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties and may adversely impact our operations.  •Significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand and a global economic recession that could further reduce demand for our products, resulting from actions taken by governments, businesses, and/or the general public in an effort to limit exposure to and spreading of such infectious diseases, such as travel restrictions, quarantines, and business shutdowns or slowdowns. 9   •Deterioration of worldwide credit and financial markets that could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures.  •Actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in legal claims or litigation against us. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, or other outbreaks of disease or similar public health threats, materially and adversely impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments. Such developments may include the geographic spread and duration of the virus, the severity of the disease, the development and timeline of an effective and broadly available vaccine and the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the outbreak. In addition, how quickly, and to what extent, normal economic and operating conditions can resume cannot be predicted, and the resumption of normal business operations may be delayed or constrained by lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our suppliers, third-party service providers, and/or customers.The inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and component parts at favorable prices could decrease our profit margins and negatively impact timely delivery to customers.We are affected by the availability and prices for raw materials and component parts, including purchased castings made of metal or alloys (such as brass, which uses copper as its main component, aluminum, stainless steel and cast iron), plastic resins, microprocessors and other electronic subassemblies, and components that are used in the manufacturing process.  The inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and component parts for our products at favorable prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations by decreasing profit margins and by negatively impacting timely deliveries to customers.  In the past, we have been able to offset price increases in raw materials and component parts by increased sales prices, active materials management, product engineering programs and the diversity of materials used in the production processes.  However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to accomplish this in the future.  Since we do not control the actual production of these raw materials and component parts, there may be delays caused by an interruption in the production or transportation of these materials for reasons that are beyond our control.  World commodity markets and inflation may also affect raw material and component part prices.

On December 30, 2020, the European Union and the United Kingdom entered into an agreement regarding their future relationship (EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement), which provisionally applies until February 28, 2021, by which date it is expected to be fully ratified by all the parties. Despite this development, Brexit continues to be the source of significant economic uncertainty in the United Kingdom and in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, which may negatively impact our business results in those regions. In addition, changes related to Brexit could result in disruptions to trade and free movement of goods, services and people to and from the United Kingdom, increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the British pound and additional legal, political and economic uncertainty, all of which could potentially disrupt the markets we serve, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions and may cause us to lose customers, suppliers and employees. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate.  Any of these effects could adversely affect our business and results of operations.Climate change, unusual weather and other natural phenomena could adversely affect our business.Climate changes and weather conditions may affect, or cause volatility in, our financial results.  Drought conditions could drive higher demand for smart water solutions that advance conservation efforts in residential and commercial applications.  Our sales also may be adversely affected by unusual weather, weather patterns or other natural phenomena that could have an impact on the timing of orders in given periods, depending on the particular mix of customers being served by us at the time. The unpredictable nature of weather conditions and climate change therefore may result in volatility for certain portions of our business, as well as the operations of certain of our customers and suppliers.Litigation against us could be costly, time consuming to defend and could adversely affect our profitability.From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.  For example, we may be subject to workers' compensation claims, employment/labor disputes, customer and supplier disputes, product liability claims, intellectual property disputes and contractual disputes related to warranties arising out of the conduct of our business.  Litigation may result in substantial costs and may divert management's attention and resources, which could adversely affect our profitability or financial condition.Disruptions and other damages to our information technology and other networks and operations, and breaches in data security or cybersecurity attacks could have a negative financial impact and damage our reputation.Our ability to serve customers, as well as increase revenues and control costs, depends in part on the reliability of our sophisticated technologies, system networks and cloud-based software.  We use information technology and other systems to manage our business in order to maximize our revenue, effectiveness and efficiency.  Unauthorized parties gaining access to digital systems and networks for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive financial, personal or business information, corrupting data, causing operational disruptions and other cyber-related risks could adversely impact our customer relationships, business plans and our reputation.  In some cases, we are dependent on third-party technologies and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability or through which hackers could gain access to sensitive and/or personal information.  These potential disruptions and cyber-attacks could negatively affect revenues, costs, customer demand, system availability and our reputation. Further, as the Company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue newer technologies that improve our operations and cost structure, the Company is also expanding and improving its information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk.  Certain new technologies present new and significant cybersecurity safety risks that must be analyzed and addressed before implementation.  If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks.Failure to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquired businesses or products could adversely affect our operations.As part of our business strategy, we continue to evaluate and may pursue selected business or product acquisition opportunities that we believe may provide us with certain operating and financial benefits.  There can be no assurance that we will identify or complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future.  If we complete any such acquisitions, they may require integration into our existing business with respect to administrative, financial, legal, sales, marketing, manufacturing and other functions to realize these anticipated benefits.  If we are unable to successfully integrate a business or product acquisition, we may not realize the benefits identified in our due diligence process, and our financial results may be negatively impacted.  Additionally, significant unexpected liabilities may arise during or after completion of an acquisition.12 "
14,BMI,BADGER METER INC,2020-02-21,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSShareholders, potential investors and other readers are urged to consider the significant business risks described below in addition to the other information set forth or incorporated by reference in this 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the “Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements” at the front of this 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  If any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occur, our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  The following list of risk factors may not be exhaustive.  We operate in a continually changing business, economic and geopolitical environment, and new risk factors may emerge from time to time.  We can neither predict these new risk factors with certainty nor assess the precise impact, if any, on our business, or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may adversely impact our results of operations.  While there is much uncertainty, we do analyze the risks we face, perform a probability assessment of their impacts and attempt to soften their potential impact when and if possible.Competitive pressures in the marketplace could decrease our revenues and profits.Competitive pressures in the marketplace for our products could adversely affect our competitive position, leading to a possible loss of market share or a decrease in prices, either of which could result in decreased revenues and profits.  We operate in an environment where competition varies from moderate to strong and a number of our competitors have greater financial resources.  Our competitors also include alliance partners that sell products that do or may compete with our products.  The principal elements of competition for our most significant product applications, residential and commercial water meters for the municipal water utility market (with various radio technology systems), are price, product technology, quality and service.  The competitive environment is also affected by the movement toward radio technologies and away from manually read meters, the demand for replacement units and, to some extent, such things as global economic conditions, the timing and size of governmental programs such as stimulus fund programs, the ability of municipal water utility customers to authorize and finance purchases of our products, our ability to obtain financing, housing starts in the United States, and overall economic activity.  For our flow instrumentation products, the competitive environment is affected by the general economic health of various industrial sectors particularly in the United States and Europe.The inability to develop technologically advanced products could harm our future success.We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards.  Although we believe that we currently have a competitive advantage in this area, maintaining such advantage will require continued investment in research and development, sales, marketing and manufacturing capabilities.  There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments or that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantage.  If we are unable to maintain our competitive advantage, our future financial performance may be adversely affected.  We are not currently aware of any emerging standards, technologies or new products that could render our existing products obsolete in the near term.  The municipal water industry is continuing to see the adoption of static water meters.  Static water metering has lower barriers to entry that could affect the competitive landscape in North America.  We believe we have a competitive product, if the adoption rate for static meters were to accelerate, we believe competitors lack brand recognition and product breadth and do not have extensive water utility channel distribution to effectively reach the more than 50,000 water utilities in the United States.7 The inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and component parts at favorable prices could decrease our profit margins and negatively impact timely delivery to customers.We are affected by the availability and prices for raw materials and component parts, including purchased castings made of metal or alloys (such as brass, which uses copper as its main component, aluminum, stainless steel and cast iron), plastic resins, glass, microprocessors and other electronic subassemblies, and components that are used in the manufacturing process.  The inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and component parts for our products at favorable prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations by decreasing profit margins and by negatively impacting timely deliveries to customers.  In the past, we have been able to offset price increases in raw materials and component parts by increased sales prices, active materials management, product engineering programs and the diversity of materials used in the production processes.  However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to accomplish this in the future.  Since we do not control the actual production of these raw materials and component parts, there may be delays caused by an interruption in the production or transportation of these materials for reasons that are beyond our control.  World commodity markets and inflation may also affect raw material and component part prices.Economic conditions could cause a material adverse impact on our sales and operating results.As a supplier of products and software, the majority of which are to water utilities, we may be adversely affected by global economic conditions, delays in governmental programs created to stimulate the economy, and the impact of government budget cuts or partial shutdowns of governmental operations that affect our customers, including independent distributors, large city utilities, public and private water companies and numerous smaller municipal water utilities.  These customers may delay capital projects, including non-critical maintenance and upgrades, or may not have the ability to authorize and finance purchases during economic downturns or instability in world markets.  We also sell products for other applications to reduce our dependency on the municipal water market.  A significant downturn in this market could cause a material adverse impact on sales and operating results.  Therefore, a downturn in general economic conditions, as well as in the municipal water market, and delays in the timing or amounts of possible economic stimulus fund programs, government budget cuts or partial shutdowns of governmental operations, or the availability of funds to municipalities could result in a reduction in demand for our products and services and could harm the business.Economic impacts due to leadership or policy changes in the countries where we do business could negatively affect our profitability.We may be affected by adjustments to economic and trade policies, such as taxation, changes to or withdrawal from international trade agreements, or the like, when countries where we produce or sell our products change leadership or economic policies.  These types of changes, as well as any related regulatory changes, could significantly increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.Global and regional economic and political conditions could adversely affect our business. In June 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union (“Brexit”), and on January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. There is now a transition period during which businesses and others prepare for the new post-Brexit rules to take effect on January 1, 2021. The ongoing negotiations of the future trading relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union during the transition period have yet to provide clarity on what the outcome will be for the United Kingdom or Europe. As a result, Brexit continues to be the source of significant economic uncertainty in the United Kingdom and in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, which may negatively impact our business results in those regions. In addition, changes related to Brexit could result in disruptions to trade and free movement of goods, services and people to and from the United Kingdom, increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the British pound and additional legal, political and economic uncertainty, all of which could potentially disrupt the markets we serve, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions and may cause us to lose customers, suppliers and employees. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate.  Any of these effects could adversely affect our business and results of operations.Climate change, unusual weather and other natural phenomena could adversely affect our business.Climate changes and weather conditions may affect, or cause volatility in, our financial results.  Drought conditions could drive higher demand for smart water solutions that advance conservation efforts in residential and commercial applications.  Our sales also may be adversely affected by unusual weather, weather patterns or other natural phenomena that could have an impact on the timing of orders in given periods, depending on the particular mix of customers being served by us at the time. The unpredictable nature of weather conditions and climate change therefore may result in volatility for certain portions of our business, as well as the operations of certain of our customers and suppliers.8 Geopolitical crisis, including terrorism or pandemics, could adversely affect our business.Our operations are susceptible to global events, including acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, political instability, and widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business results and financial condition.Failure to manufacture quality products could have a material adverse effect on our business.If we fail to maintain and enforce quality control and testing procedures, our products will not meet required performance standards.  Product quality and performance are a priority for us since our products are used in various applications where precise control of fluids is essential.  Although we believe our products are perceived as high quality, any future production and/or sale of substandard products could seriously harm our reputation, resulting in both a loss of current customers to competitors and damage to our ability to attract new customers.  In addition, if any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products or incur warranty related expenses.  A successful claim brought against us with respect to a defective product in excess of available insurance coverage, if any, or a requirement to participate in a major product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.Litigation against us could be costly, time consuming to defend and could adversely affect our profitability.From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.  For example, we may be subject to workers' compensation claims, employment/labor disputes, customer and supplier disputes, product liability claims, intellectual property disputes and contractual disputes related to warranties arising out of the conduct of our business.  Litigation may result in substantial costs and may divert management's attention and resources, which could adversely affect our profitability or financial condition.If our technology products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected.We sell and install software products, including some that are provided in “the cloud,” that may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer.  A failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products or a failure or breach of a cloud network could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Our expanded role as a prime contractor brings certain risks that could have a material adverse effect to our business.The Company periodically assumes the role of prime contractor for providing complete technology systems, installation and project management to governmental entities, which brings with it added risks, including but not limited to, our responsibility for managing subcontractor performance and project timelines and the potential for expanded warranty and performance obligations.  While we have managed a number of these types of arrangements, it is possible to encounter a situation where we may not be able to perform to the expectations of the governmental entity, and thus incur additional costs that could affect our profitability or harm our reputation.Disruptions and other damages to our information technology and other networks and operations, and breaches in data security or cybersecurity attacks could have a negative financial impact and damage our reputation.Our ability to serve customers, as well as increase revenues and control costs, depends in part on the reliability of our sophisticated technologies, system networks and cloud-based software.  We use information technology and other systems to manage our business in order to maximize our revenue, effectiveness and efficiency.  Unauthorized parties gaining access to digital systems and networks for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive financial, personal or business information, corrupting data, causing operational disruptions and other cyber-related risks could adversely impact our customer relationships, business plans and our reputation.  In some cases, we are dependent on third-party technologies and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability or through which hackers could gain access to sensitive and/or personal information.  These potential disruptions and cyber-attacks could negatively affect revenues, costs, customer demand, system availability and our reputation. Further, as the Company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue newer technologies that improve our operations and cost structure, the Company is also expanding and improving its information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk.  Certain new technologies present new and significant cybersecurity safety risks that must be analyzed and addressed before implementation.  If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks.9 If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our software and related products, our ability to market our software products could be hindered and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights.  These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information.  In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and software products may increasingly be subject to third-party infringement claims.  Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.Changes in environmental or regulatory requirements could entail additional expenses that could decrease our profitability.We are subject to a variety of laws in various countries and markets, such as those regulating lead or other material content in certain of our products, the handling and disposal of certain electronic materials, the use and/or licensing of radio frequencies necessary for radio products, data privacy and protection, as well as customs and trade practices.  We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future environmental or regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing or future laws will be administered or interpreted.  Currently, the cost of complying with existing laws is included as part of our on-going expenses and does not have a material effect on our business or financial position, but a change in the future could adversely affect our profitability.Risks related to foreign markets could decrease our profitability.Since we sell products worldwide as well as manufacture products in several countries, we are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally.  These risks include such things as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in political or economic conditions of specific countries or regions, potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws or regulatory requirements, differing labor regulations, and the difficulty of managing widespread operations.An inability to attract and retain skilled employees could negatively impact our growth and decrease our profitability.Our success depends on our continued ability to identify, attract, develop and retain skilled personnel throughout our organization.  Current and future compensation arrangements, including benefits, may not be sufficient to attract new employees or retain existing employees, which may hinder our growth.Violations or alleged violations of laws that impose requirements for the conduct of the Company’s overseas operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or other anti-corruption laws, trade sanctions and sanctioned parties restrictions could adversely affect our business.In foreign countries where we operate, a risk exists that our employees, third party partners or agents could engage in business practices prohibited by applicable laws and regulations, such as the FCPA.  Such anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies from making improper payments to foreign officials, require companies to keep accurate books and records, and maintain appropriate internal controls.  Our policies mandate strict compliance with such laws and we devote resources to ensure compliance.  However, we operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption, and, in certain circumstances, local customs and practice might not be consistent with the requirements of anti-corruption laws.  We remain subject to the risk that our employees, third party partners or agents will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and violate such laws and regulations.  Violations by us or a third party acting on our behalf could result in significant internal investigation costs and legal fees, civil and criminal penalties, including prohibitions on the conduct of our business and reputational harm.We may also be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we violate U.S. trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the European Union, the United Nations and trade sanction laws, such as the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012.  Our policies mandate strict compliance with such laws and we devote resources to ensure compliance.Failure to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquired businesses or products could adversely affect our operations.As part of our business strategy, we continue to evaluate and may pursue selected business or product acquisition opportunities that we believe may provide us with certain operating and financial benefits.  There can be no assurance that we will identify or complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future.  If we complete any such acquisitions, they may require integration into our existing business with respect to administrative, financial, sales, marketing, manufacturing and other functions to realize these anticipated benefits.  If we are unable to successfully integrate a business or product acquisition, we may not realize the benefits identified in our due diligence process, and our financial results may be negatively impacted.  Additionally, significant unexpected liabilities may arise during or after completion of an acquisition.10 "

policies.  These types of changes, as well as any related regulatory changes, could significantly increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.Global and regional economic and political conditions could adversely affect our business. In June 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union (“Brexit”), and the British government has indicated that it intends to negotiate the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union based on the results of this vote.  The Brexit vote has created significant economic uncertainty in the United Kingdom and in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, which may negatively impact our business results in those regions.  In addition, the terms of Brexit, once negotiated, could potentially disrupt the markets we serve, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions and may cause us to lose customers, suppliers and employees.  In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate.  Any of these effects could adversely affect our business and results of operations.Unusual weather and other natural phenomena could adversely affect our business.Our sales may be adversely affected by unusual weather, weather patterns or other natural phenomena that could have an impact on the timing of orders in given periods, depending on the particular mix of customers being served by us at the time.Failure to manufacture quality products could have a material adverse effect on our business.If we fail to maintain and enforce quality control and testing procedures, our products will not meet required performance standards.  Product quality and performance are a priority for us since our products are used in various applications where precise control of fluids is essential.  Although we believe we have a very good reputation for product quality, any future production and/or sale of substandard products would seriously harm our reputation, resulting in both a loss of current customers to competitors and damage to our ability to attract new customers.  In addition, if any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products or incur warranty related expenses.  A successful claim brought against us with respect to a defective product in excess of available insurance coverage, if any, or a requirement to participate in a major product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.9 Litigation against us could be costly, time consuming to defend and could adversely affect our profitability.From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.  For example, we may be subject to workers' compensation claims, employment/labor disputes, customer and supplier disputes, product liability claims, intellectual property disputes and contractual disputes related to warranties arising out of the conduct of our business.  Litigation may result in substantial costs and may divert management's attention and resources, which could adversely affect our profitability or financial condition.If our technology products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected.We sell and install software products, including some that are provided in “the cloud,” that may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer.  A failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products or a failure of a cloud network could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Our expanded role as a prime contractor brings certain risks that could have a material adverse effect to our business.The Company periodically assumes the role as a prime contractor for providing complete technology systems to governmental entities, which brings with it added risks, including but not limited to, our responsibility for managing subcontractor performance and the potential for expanded warranty and performance obligations.  While we have managed a limited number of these types of arrangements, it is possible to encounter a situation where we may not be able to perform up to the expectations of the governmental entity, and thus incur additional costs that could affect our profitability or harm our reputation.Disruptions and other damages to our information technology and other networks and operations, and breaches in data security or cybersecurity attacks could have a negative financial impact and damage our reputation.Our ability to serve customers, as well as increase revenues and control costs, depends in part on the reliability of our sophisticated technologies, system networks and cloud-based software.  We use information technology and other systems to manage our business in order to maximize our revenue, effectiveness and efficiency.  Unauthorized parties gaining access to digital systems and networks for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive financial, personal or business information, corrupting data, causing operational disruptions and other cyber-related risks could adversely impact our customer relationships, business plans and our reputation.  In some cases, we are dependent on third-party technologies and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability or through which hackers could gain access to sensitive and/or personal information.  These potential disruptions and cyber-attacks could negatively affect revenues, costs, customer demand, system availability and our reputation.

subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we violate U.S. trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the European Union, the United Nations and trade sanction laws, such as the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012.Failure to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquired businesses or products could adversely affect our operations.As part of our business strategy, we continue to evaluate and may pursue selected business or product acquisition opportunities that we believe may provide us with certain operating and financial benefits.  There can be no assurance that we will identify or complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future.  If we complete any such acquisitions, they may require integration into our existing business with respect to administrative, financial, sales, marketing, manufacturing and other functions to realize these anticipated benefits.  If we are unable to successfully integrate a business or product acquisition, we may not realize the benefits identified in our due diligence process, and our financial results may be negatively impacted.  Additionally, significant unexpected liabilities may arise during or after completion of an acquisition.11 "

RISK FACTORSShareholders, potential investors and other readers are urged to consider the significant business risks described below in addition to the other information set forth or incorporated by reference in this 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the “Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements” at the front of this 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  If any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occur, our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  The following list of risk factors may not be exhaustive.  We operate in a continually changing business, economic and geopolitical environment, and new risk factors may emerge from time to time.  We can neither predict these new risk factors with certainty nor assess the precise impact, if any, on our business, or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may adversely impact our results of operations.  While there is much uncertainty, we do analyze the risks we face, perform a probability assessment of their impacts and attempt to soften their potential impact when and if possible.Competitive pressures in the marketplace could decrease our revenues and profits.Competitive pressures in the marketplace for our products could adversely affect our competitive position, leading to a possible loss of market share or a decrease in prices, either of which could result in decreased revenues and profits.  We operate in an environment where competition varies from moderate to intense and a number of our competitors have greater financial resources.  Our competitors also include alliance partners that sell products that do or may compete with our products, particularly those that provide radio solutions.  The principal elements of competition for our most significant product applications, residential and commercial water meters for the municipal water utility market (with various radio technology systems), are price, product technology, quality and service.  The competitive environment is also affected by the movement toward radio technologies and away from manually read meters, the demand for replacement units and, to some extent, such things as global economic conditions, the timing and size of governmental programs such as stimulus fund programs, the ability of municipal water utility customers to authorize and finance purchases of our products, our ability to obtain financing, housing starts in the United States, and overall economic activity.  For our flow instrumentation products, the competitive environment is affected by the general economic health of various industrial sectors particularly in the United States and Europe. The inability to develop technologically advanced products could harm our future success.We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards.  Although we believe that we currently have a competitive advantage in this area, maintaining such advantage will require continued investment in research and development, sales, marketing and manufacturing capabilities.  There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments or that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantage.  If we are unable to maintain our competitive advantage, our future financial performance may be adversely affected.  We are not currently aware of any emerging standards, technologies or new products that could render our existing products obsolete in the near term.  The water utility industry is beginning to see the adoption of ultrasonic (electronic) water meters.  Electronic water metering has lower barriers to entry that could affect the competitive landscape in North America.  We believe we have a competitive product if the adoption rate for electronic meters were to accelerate.7The inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and component parts at favorable prices could decrease our profit margins and negatively impact timely delivery to customers.    We are affected by the availability and prices for raw materials and component parts, including purchased castings made of metal or alloys (such as brass, which uses copper as its main component, aluminum, stainless steel and cast iron), plastic resins, glass, microprocessors and other electronic subassemblies, and components that are used in the manufacturing process.  The inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and component parts for our products at favorable prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations by decreasing profit margins and by negatively impacting timely deliveries to customers.  In the past, we have been able to offset increases in raw materials and component parts by increased sales prices, active materials management, product engineering programs and the diversity of materials used in the production processes.  However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to accomplish this in the future.  Since we do not control the actual production of these raw materials and component parts, there may be delays caused by an interruption in the production or transportation of these materials for reasons that are beyond our control.  World commodity markets and inflation may also affect raw material and component part prices.Regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses.The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted disclosure requirements related to certain minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo and surrounding countries, or “conflict minerals,” that are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by a Securities and Exchange Commission reporting company.  The minerals that the rules cover are commonly referred to as “3TG” and include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold.  Implementation of the disclosure requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of some of the materials that we use in the manufacture of our products.  Our supply chain is complex, and if we are not able to determine the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products or that our products are “conflict free,” then we may face reputational challenges with customers or investors.Economic conditions could cause a material adverse impact on our sales and operating results.As a supplier of products, the majority of which are to water utilities, we may be adversely affected by global economic conditions, delays in governmental programs created to stimulate the economy, and the impact of government budget cuts or partial shutdowns of governmental operations that affect our customers, including independent distributors, large city utilities, private water companies and numerous smaller municipal water utilities.  These customers may delay capital projects, including non-critical maintenance and upgrades, or may not have the ability to authorize and finance purchases during economic downturns or instability in world markets.  We also sell products for other applications to reduce our dependency on the municipal water market.  A significant downturn in this market could cause a material adverse impact on sales and operating results.  Therefore, a downturn in general economic conditions, as well as in the municipal water market, and delays in the timing or amounts of possible economic stimulus fund programs, government budget cuts or partial shutdowns of governmental operations, or the availability of funds to municipalities could result in a reduction in demand for our products and services and could harm the business.Economic impacts due to leadership or policy changes in the countries where we do business could negatively affect our profitability.We may be affected by adjustments to economic and trade policies, such as taxation, changes to or withdrawal from international trade agreements, or the like, when countries where we produce or sell our products change leadership or economic policies.  These types of changes, as well as any related regulatory changes, could significantly increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.Unusual weather and other natural phenomena could adversely affect our business.Our sales may be adversely affected by unusual weather, weather patterns or other natural phenomena that could have an impact on the timing of orders in given periods, depending on the particular mix of customers being served by us at the time.8Failure to manufacture quality products could have a material adverse effect on our business.If we fail to maintain and enforce quality control and testing procedures, our products will not meet required performance standards.  Product quality and performance are a priority for us since our products are used in various applications where precise control of fluids is essential.  Although we believe we have a very good reputation for product quality, any future production and/or sale of substandard products would seriously harm our reputation, resulting in both a loss of current customers to competitors and damage to our ability to attract new customers.  In addition, if any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products.  A successful claim brought against us with respect to a defective product in excess of available insurance coverage, if any, or a requirement to participate in a major product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.Litigation against us could be costly, time consuming to defend and could adversely affect our profitability. From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.  For example, we may be subject to workers' compensation claims, employment/labor disputes, customer and supplier disputes, product liability claims, intellectual property disputes and contractual disputes related to warranties arising out of the conduct of our business.  Litigation may result in substantial costs and may divert management's attention and resources, which could adversely affect our profitability or financial condition.If our technology products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected. We sell and install software products, including some that are provided in ""the cloud,"" that may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer.  A failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products or a failure of a cloud network could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our expanded role as a prime contractor brings certain risks that could have a material adverse effect to our business.     The Company periodically assumes the role as a prime contractor for providing complete technology systems to governmental entities, which brings with it added risks, including but not limited to, our responsibility for managing subcontractor performance and the potential for expanded warranty and performance obligations.  While we have managed a limited number of these types of arrangements, it is possible to encounter a situation where we may not be able to perform up to the expectations of the governmental entity, and thus incur additional costs that could affect our profitability or harm our reputation. Disruptions and other damages to our information technology and other networks and operations, and breaches in data security or cybersecurity attacks could have a negative financial impact and damage our reputation.Our ability to serve customers, as well as increase revenues and control costs, depends in part on the reliability of our sophisticated technologies, system networks and cloud-based software.  We use information technology and other systems to manage our business in order to maximize our revenue, effectiveness and efficiency.  Unauthorized parties gaining access to digital systems and networks for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive financial, personal or business information, corrupting data, causing operational disruptions and other cyber-related risks could adversely impact our customer relationships, business plans and our reputation.  In some cases, we are dependent on third-party technologies and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability or through which hackers could gain access to sensitive and/or personal information.  These potential disruptions and cyber-attacks could negatively affect revenues, costs, customer demand, system availability and our reputation.     If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our software and related products, our ability to market our software products could be hindered and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights.  These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information.  In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and software products may increasingly be subject to third-party infringement claims.  Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. 9Changes in environmental or regulatory requirements could entail additional expenses that could decrease our profitability.We are subject to a variety of laws in various countries and markets, such as those regulating lead or other material content in certain of our products, the handling and disposal of certain electronic materials, the use and/or licensing of radio frequencies necessary for radio products, data privacy and protection, as well as customs and trade practices.  We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future environmental or regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing or future laws will be administered or interpreted.  Currently, the cost of complying with existing laws is included as part of our on-going expenses and does not have a material effect on our business or financial position, but a change in the future could adversely affect our profitability.Risks related to foreign markets could decrease our profitability.Since we sell products worldwide as well as manufacture products in several countries, we are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally.  These risks include such things as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in political or economic conditions of specific countries or regions, potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws or regulatory requirements, differing labor regulations, and the difficulty of managing widespread operations.An inability to attract and retain skilled employees could negatively impact our growth and decrease our profitability.Our success depends on our continued ability to identify, attract, develop and retain skilled personnel throughout our organization.  Current and future compensation arrangements, including benefits, may not be sufficient to attract new employees or retain existing employees, which may hinder our growth.  Rising healthcare and retirement benefit costs could increase cost pressures and decrease our profitability.We estimate liabilities and expenses for retirement plans and other postretirement benefits that require the use of assumptions relating to the rates used to discount the future estimated liability, rate of return on any assets and various assumptions related to the age and cost of the workforce.  Actual results may differ from the estimates and have a material adverse effect on future results of operations or on the financial statements as a whole.  Rising healthcare and retirement benefit costs in the United States may also add to cost pressures and decrease our profitability.A failure to maintain good corporate governance practices could damage our reputation and adversely affect our future success.We have a history of good corporate governance, including procedures and processes that are required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, and related statutes, rules and regulations, such as board committee charters, principles of corporate governance, a code of business conduct and applicable exchange listing standards.  Failure to maintain these corporate governance practices could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Violations or alleged violations of laws that impose requirements for the conduct of our overseas operations, including the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws, sanctioned parties restrictions and FATCA could adversely affect our business. In foreign countries where we operate, a risk exists that our employees, third party partners or agents could engage in business practices prohibited by applicable laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).  Such anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies from making improper payments to foreign officials and require companies to keep accurate books and records and maintain appropriate internal controls.  Our policies mandate strict compliance with such laws and we devote resources to ensure compliance.  However, we operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption, and, in certain circumstances, local customs and practice might not be consistent with the requirements of anti-corruption laws.  We remain subject to the risk that our employees, third party partners or agents will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and violate such laws and regulations.  Violations by us or a third party acting on our behalf could result in significant internal investigation costs and legal fees, civil and criminal penalties, including prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and reputational harm.We may also be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we violate U.S. trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the European Union and the United Nations, and trade sanction laws such as the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012.10In addition, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requires certain of our subsidiaries, affiliates and other entities to obtain valid FATCA documentation from payees prior to remitting certain payments to such payees.  In the event we do not obtain valid FATCA documents, we may be obliged to withhold a portion of such payments.  This obligation is shared with our customers and clients who may fail to comply, in whole or in part.  In such circumstances, we may incur FATCA compliance costs including withholding taxes, interest and penalties.  Regulatory initiatives and changes in the regulations and guidance promulgated under FATCA may increase our costs of operations, and could adversely affect the market for our services as intermediaries, which could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.Failure to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquired businesses or products could adversely affect our operations.As part of our business strategy, we continue to evaluate and may pursue selected business or product acquisition opportunities that we believe may provide us with certain operating and financial benefits.  There can be no assurance that we will identify or complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future.  If we complete any such acquisitions, they may require integration into our existing business with respect to administrative, financial, sales, marketing, manufacturing and other functions to realize these anticipated benefits.

Our supply chain is complex, and if we are not able to determine the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products or that our products are “conflict free,” then we may face reputational challenges with customers or investors.  We could also incur significant costs related to the compliance process, including potential difficulty or added costs in satisfying disclosure and audit requirements.7Economic conditions could cause a material adverse impact on our sales and operating results.As a supplier of products, the majority of which are to water utilities, we may be adversely affected by global economic conditions, delays in governmental programs created to stimulate the economy, and the impact of government budget cuts or partial shutdowns of governmental operations that affect our customers, including independent distributors, large city utilities, private water companies and numerous smaller municipal water utilities.

While there is much uncertainty, we do analyze the risks we face, perform a probability assessment of their impacts and attempt to soften their potential impact when and if possible.Competitive pressures in the marketplace could decrease our revenues and profits.Competitive pressures in the marketplace for our products could adversely affect our competitive position, leading to a possible loss of market share or a decrease in prices, either of which could result in decreased revenues and profits.  We operate in an environment where competition varies from moderate to intense and a number of our competitors have greater financial resources.  Our competitors also include alliance partners that sell products that do or may compete with our products, particularly those that provide radio solutions.  The principal elements of competition for our most significant product applications, residential and commercial water meters for the municipal water utility market (with various radio technology systems), are price, product technology, quality and service.  The competitive environment is also affected by the movement toward radio technologies and away from manually read meters, the demand for replacement units and, to some extent, such things as global economic conditions, the timing and size of governmental programs such as stimulus fund programs, the 5ability of municipal water utility customers to authorize and finance purchases of our products, our ability to obtain financing, housing starts in the United States, and overall economic activity.  For our flow instrumentation products, the competitive environment is affected by the general economic health of various industrial sectors particularly in the United States and Europe. The inability to develop technologically advanced products could harm our future success.We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards.  Although we believe that we currently have a competitive advantage in this area, maintaining such advantage will require continued investment in research and development, sales, marketing and manufacturing capabilities.  There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments or that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantage.  If we are unable to maintain our competitive advantage, our future financial performance may be adversely affected.  We are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products that could render our existing products obsolete in the near term.  The water utility industry is beginning to see the adoption of ultrasonic (electronic) water meters.  Electronic water metering has lower barriers to entry that could affect the competitive landscape in North America.  We believe we have a competitive product if the adoption rate for electronic meters were to accelerate.The inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and component parts at favorable prices could decrease our profit margins and negatively impact timely delivery to customers.    We are affected by the availability and prices for raw materials and component parts, including purchased castings made of metal or alloys (such as brass, which uses copper as its main component, aluminum, stainless steel and cast iron), plastic resins, glass, microprocessors and other electronic subassemblies, and components that are used in the manufacturing process.  The inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and component parts for our products at favorable prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations by decreasing profit margins and by negatively impacting timely deliveries to customers.  In the past, we have been able to offset increases in raw materials and component parts by increased sales prices, active materials management, product engineering programs and the diversity of materials used in the production processes.  However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to accomplish this in the future.  Since we do not control the actual production of these raw materials and component parts, there may be delays caused by an interruption in the production or transportation of these materials for reasons that are beyond our control.  World commodity markets and inflation may also affect raw material and component part prices.Regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses.The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted disclosure requirements related to certain minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo and surrounding countries, or “conflict minerals,” that are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by a Securities and Exchange Commission reporting company.  The minerals that the rules cover are commonly referred to as “3TG” and include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold.  Implementation of the disclosure requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of some of the materials that we use in the manufacture of our products.  There is also uncertainty relating to the requirements of the regulations as a result of ongoing litigation challenging the constitutionality of portions of the regulations.  Our supply chain is complex, and if we are not able to determine the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products or that our products are “conflict free,” then we may face reputational challenges with customers or investors.  We could also incur significant costs related to the compliance process, including potential difficulty or added costs in satisfying disclosure and audit requirements.Economic conditions could cause a material adverse impact on our sales and operating results.As a supplier of products, the majority of which are to water utilities, we may be adversely affected by global economic conditions, delays in governmental programs created to stimulate the economy, and the impact of government budget cuts or partial shutdowns of governmental operations that affect our customers, including independent distributors, large city utilities, private water companies and numerous smaller municipal water utilities.  These customers may delay capital projects, including non-critical maintenance and upgrades, or may not have the ability to authorize and finance purchases during economic downturns or instability in world markets.  We also sell products for other applications to reduce our dependency on the municipal water market.  A significant downturn in this market could cause a material adverse impact on sales and operating results.  Therefore, a downturn in general economic conditions, as well as in the municipal water market, and delays in the timing or amounts of possible economic stimulus fund programs, government budget cuts or partial shutdowns of governmental operations, or the availability of funds to municipalities could result in a reduction in demand for our products and services and could harm the business.6Unusual weather and other natural phenomena could adversely affect our business.Our sales may be adversely affected by unusual weather and natural phenomena that could have an impact on the timing of orders in given periods, depending on the particular mix of customers being served by us at the time.Failure to manufacture quality products could have a material adverse effect on our business.If we fail to maintain and enforce quality control and testing procedures, our products will not meet required performance standards.  Product quality and performance are a priority for us since our products are used in various applications where precise control of fluids is essential.  Although we believe we have a very good reputation for product quality, any future production and/or sale of substandard products would seriously harm our reputation, resulting in both a loss of current customers to competitors and damage to our ability to attract new customers.  In addition, if any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products.  A successful claim brought against us with respect to a defective product in excess of available insurance coverage, if any, or a requirement to participate in a major product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.Litigation against us could be costly, time consuming to defend and could adversely affect our profitability. From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.  For example, we may be subject to workers' compensation claims, employment/labor disputes, customer and supplier disputes, product liability claims, intellectual property disputes and contractual disputes related to warranties arising out of the conduct of our business.  Litigation may result in substantial costs and may divert management's attention and resources, which could adversely affect our profitability or financial condition.If our technology products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected. We sell and install software products that may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer.  A failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Disruptions and other damages to our information technology and other networks and operations, and breaches in data security could have a negative financial impact and damage our reputation.Our ability to serve customers, as well as increase revenues and control costs, depends in part on the reliability of our sophisticated technologies and system networks.  We use information technology and other systems to manage our business in order to maximize our revenue, effectiveness and efficiency.  Unauthorized parties gaining access to digital systems and networks for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive financial, personal or business information, corrupting data, causing operational disruptions and other cyber-related risks could adversely impact our customer relationships, business plans and our reputation.  In some cases, we are dependent on third-party technologies and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability or through which hackers could gain access to sensitive and/or personal information.  These potential disruptions and cyber-attacks could negatively affect revenues, costs, customer demand, system availability and our reputation.     If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our software and related products, our ability to market our software products could be hindered and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights.  These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information.  In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and software products may increasingly be subject to third-party infringement claims.  Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. 7Changes in environmental or regulatory requirements could entail additional expenses that could decrease our profitability.We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future environmental or regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing or future laws will be administered or interpreted.  Compliance with such laws or regulations may entail additional expenses that could decrease profitability.  We are subject to a variety of environmental laws, such as lead content in certain meters incorporating brass housings or the handling of certain electronic materials, and regulatory laws affecting the use and/or licensing of radio frequencies necessary for radio products, as well as regulations related to customs and trade practices.  Currently, the cost of complying with existing laws is included as part of our on-going expenses and does not have a material effect on our business or financial position, but a change in the future could adversely affect our profitability.Risks related to foreign markets could decrease our profitability.Since we sell products worldwide as well as manufacture products in several countries, we are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally.  These risks include such things as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in political or economic conditions of specific countries or regions, potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws or regulatory requirements, differing labor regulations, and the difficulty of managing widespread operations.An inability to attract and retain skilled employees could negatively impact our growth and decrease our profitability.Our success depends on our continued ability to identify, attract, develop and retain skilled personnel throughout our organization.  Current and future compensation arrangements, including benefits, may not be sufficient to attract new employees or retain existing employees, which may hinder our growth.  Rising healthcare and retirement benefit costs could increase cost pressures and decrease our profitability.We estimate liabilities and expenses for retirement plans and other postretirement benefits that require the use of assumptions relating to the rates used to discount the future estimated liability, rate of return on any assets and various assumptions related to the age and cost of the workforce.  Actual results may differ from the estimates and have a material adverse effect on future results of operations or on the financial statements as a whole.  Rising healthcare and retirement benefit costs in the United States may also add to cost pressures and decrease our profitability.A failure to maintain good corporate governance practices could damage our reputation and adversely affect our future success.We have a history of good corporate governance, including procedures and processes that are required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, and related rules and regulations, such as board committee charters, and a code of business conduct that defines how employees interact with our various stakeholders and addresses issues such as confidentiality, conflict of interest and fair dealing, and applicable exchange listing standards.  Failure to maintain these corporate governance practices could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Failure to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquired businesses or products could adversely affect our operations.As part of our business strategy, we continue to evaluate and may pursue selected business or product acquisition opportunities that we believe may provide us with certain operating and financial benefits.  There can be no assurance that we will identify or complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future.  If we complete any such acquisitions, they may require integration into our existing business with respect to administrative, financial, sales, marketing, manufacturing and other functions to realize these anticipated benefits.  If we are unable to successfully integrate a business or product acquisition, we may not realize the benefits identified in our due diligence process, and our financial results may be negatively impacted.  Additionally, significant unexpected liabilities may arise during or after completion of an acquisition"

Compliance with such laws or regulations may entail additional expenses that could decrease profitability.  We are subject to a variety of environmental laws, such as lead content in certain meters incorporating brass housings, and regulatory laws affecting the use and/or licensing of radio frequencies necessary for radio products, as well as regulations related to customs and trade practices.  Currently, the cost of complying with existing laws is included as part of our on-going expenses and does not have a material effect on our business or financial position, but a change in the future could adversely affect our profitability.Risks related to foreign markets could decrease our profitability.Since we sell products worldwide as well as manufacture products in several countries, we are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally.  These risks include such things as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws or regulatory requirements, differing labor regulations, and the difficulty of managing widespread operations.An inability to attract and retain skilled employees could negatively impact our growth and decrease our profitability.Our success depends on our continued ability to identify, attract, develop and retain skilled personnel throughout our organization.  Current and future compensation arrangements, including benefits, may not be sufficient to attract new employees or retain existing employees, which may hinder our growth.  Rising healthcare and retirement benefit costs could increase cost pressures and decrease our profitability.We estimate liabilities and expenses for retirement plans and other postretirement benefits that require the use of assumptions relating to the rates used to discount the future estimated liability, rate of return on any assets and various assumptions related to the age and cost of the workforce.  Actual results may differ from the estimates and have a material 8adverse effect on future results of operations or on the financial statements as a whole.  Rising healthcare and retirement benefit costs in the United States may also add to cost pressures and decrease our profitability.A failure to maintain good corporate governance practices could damage our reputation and adversely affect our future success.We have a history of good corporate governance, including procedures and processes that are required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules and regulations, such as board committee charters, and a code of business conduct that defines how employees interact with our various stakeholders and addresses issues such as confidentiality, conflict of interest and fair dealing, and applicable exchange listing standards.  Failure to maintain these corporate governance practices could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses or products could adversely affect our operations.As part of our business strategy, we continue to evaluate and may pursue selected business or product acquisition opportunities that we believe may provide us with certain operating and financial benefits.  If we complete any such acquisitions, they may require integration into our existing business with respect to administrative, financial, sales, marketing, manufacturing and other functions to realize these anticipated benefits.  If we are unable to successfully integrate a business or product acquisition, we may not realize the benefits identified in our due diligence process, and our financial results may be negatively impacted.  Additionally, significant unexpected liabilities may arise during or after completion of an acquisition"
13,BMI,BADGER METER INC,2013-03-05,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSShareholders, potential investors and other readers are urged to consider the significant business risks described below in addition to the other information set forth or incorporated by reference in this 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the “Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements” at the front of this 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  If any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occur, our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  The following list of risk factors may not be exhaustive.  We operate in a continually changing business, economic and geopolitical environment, and new risk factors may emerge from time to time.  We can neither predict these new risk factors with certainty nor assess the precise impact, if any, on our business, or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may adversely impact our results of operations.  While there is much uncertainty, we do analyze the risks we face, perform a probability assessment of their impacts and attempt to soften their potential impact when and if possible.Competitive pressures in the marketplace could decrease our revenues and profits.Competitive pressures in the marketplace for our products could adversely affect our competitive position, leading to a possible loss of market share or a decrease in prices, either of which could result in decreased revenues and profits.  We operate in an environment where competition varies from moderate to intense and a number of our competitors have greater financial resources.  Our competitors also include alliance partners that sell products that do or may compete with our products, particularly those that provide radio solutions.  The principal elements of competition for our most significant product applications, residential and commercial water meters for the municipal water utility market (with various radio technology systems), are price, product technology, quality and service.  The competitive environment is also affected by the movement toward radio technologies and away from manually read meters, the demand for replacement units and, to some extent, such things as global economic conditions, the timing and size of governmental programs such as stimulus fund programs, the ability of municipal water utility customers to authorize and finance purchases of our products, our ability to obtain financing, housing starts in the United States, and overall economic activity.  For our industrial flow and specialty products, the competitive environment is affected by the general economic health of various industrial sectors particularly in the United States and Europe. The inability to develop technologically advanced products could harm our future success.We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards.  Although we believe that we currently have a competitive advantage in this area, maintaining such advantage will require continued investment in research and development, sales, marketing and manufacturing capabilities.  There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments or that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantage.  If we are unable to maintain our competitive advantage, our future financial performance may be adversely affected.   We are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products that could render our existing products obsolete.The inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and component parts at favorable prices could decrease our profit margins and negatively impact timely delivery to customers.    We are affected by the availability and prices for raw materials, including purchased castings made of metal or alloys (such as brass, which uses copper as its main component, aluminum, stainless steel and cast iron), plastic resins, glass, microprocessors and other electronic subassemblies, and components that are used in the manufacturing process.  The inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and component parts for our products at favorable prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations by decreasing profit margins and by negatively impacting timely deliveries to customers.  In the past, we have been able to offset increases in raw materials and component parts by increased sales prices, active materials management, product engineering programs and the diversity of materials used 6in the production processes.  However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to accomplish this in the future.  Since we do not control the actual production of these raw materials and component parts, there may be delays caused by an interruption in the production of these materials for reasons that are beyond our control.  World commodity markets and inflation may also affect raw material and component part prices.New regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses.The Securities and Exchange Commission recently adopted additional disclosure requirements related to certain minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo and surrounding countries, or “conflict minerals,” that are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by a Securities and Exchange Commission reporting company.  The minerals that the final rules cover are commonly referred to as “3TG” and include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold.  Implementation of the new disclosure requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of some of the materials that we use in the manufacture of our products.  Our supply chain is complex, and if we are not able to conclusively verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products or that our products are “conflict free,” then we may face reputational challenges with customers or investors.  We could also incur significant costs related to the compliance process, including potential difficulty or added costs in satisfying the disclosure requirements.Economic conditions could cause a material adverse impact on our sales and operating results.As a supplier of products, the majority of which are to water utilities, we may be adversely affected by global economic conditions and delays in governmental programs created to stimulate the economy that affect our customers, including independent distributors, large city utilities, private water companies and numerous smaller municipal water utilities.  These customers may delay capital projects, including non-critical maintenance and upgrades, or may not have the ability to authorize and finance purchases during economic downturns or instability in world markets.  We also sell products for other applications to reduce our dependency on the municipal water market.  A significant downturn in this market could cause a material adverse impact on sales and operating results.  Therefore, a downturn in general economic conditions, as well as in the municipal water market, and delays in the timing or amounts of possible economic stimulus fund programs or the availability of funds to municipalities could result in a reduction in demand for our products and services and could harm the business.Failure to manufacture quality products could have a material adverse effect on our business.If we fail to maintain and enforce quality control and testing procedures, our products will not meet required performance standards.  Product quality and performance are a priority for us since our products are used in various applications where precise control of fluids is essential.  Although we believe we have a very good reputation for product quality, any future production and/or sale of substandard products would seriously harm our reputation, resulting in both a loss of current customers to competitors and damage to our ability to attract new customers.  In addition, if any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products.  A successful claim brought against us with respect to a defective product in excess of available insurance coverage, if any, or a requirement to participate in a major product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.Litigation against us could be costly, time consuming to defend and could adversely affect our profitability. From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.  For example, we may be subject to workers' compensation claims, employment/labor disputes, customer and supplier disputes, product liability claims, intellectual property disputes and contractual disputes related to warranties arising out of the conduct of our business.  Litigation may result in substantial costs and may divert management's attention and resources, which could adversely affect our profitability or financial condition.Changes in environmental or regulatory requirements could entail additional expenses that could decrease our profitability.We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future environmental or regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing or future laws will be administered or interpreted.  Compliance with such laws or regulations may entail additional expenses that could decrease profitability.  We are subject to a variety of environmental laws, such as lead content in certain meters incorporating brass housings, and regulatory laws affecting the use and/or licensing of radio frequencies necessary for radio products, as well as regulations related to customs and trade practices.

These risks include changes in    foreign currency exchange rates,    6     changes in a specific countrys or regions political    or economic conditions, potentially negative consequences from    changes in tax laws or regulatory requirements, differing labor    regulations, and the difficulty of managing widespread    operations. An    inability to attract and retain skilled employees could    negatively impact growth and decrease    profitability:     Our success depends on our continued ability to identify,    attract, develop and retain skilled personnel throughout our    organization. Current and future compensation arrangements,    including benefits, may not be sufficient to attract new    employees or retain existing employees, which may hinder our    growth. In addition, we estimate liabilities and expenses for    pensions and other postretirement benefits that require the use    of assumptions relating to the rates used to discount the future    estimated liability, rate of return on any assets and various    assumptions related to the age and cost of the workforce. Actual    results may differ from the estimates and have a material    adverse effect on future results of operations or on the    financial statements as a whole. Rising healthcare and    retirement benefit costs in the United States may also add to    cost pressures and decrease our profitability. A    failure to maintain good corporate governance practices could    damage our reputation and adversely affect our future    success:     We have a history of good corporate governance, including    procedures and processes that are required by the Sarbanes-Oxley    Act of 2002 and related rules and regulations, such as board    committee charters, and a Code of Business Conduct that defines    how employees interact with our various stakeholders and    addresses issues such as confidentiality, conflict of interest    and fair dealing. Failure to maintain these corporate governance    practices could harm our reputation and have a material adverse    effect on our business and results of operations. Failure    to successfully integrate acquired businesses or products in the    future could adversely affect the operations:     As part of our business strategy, we will continue to evaluate    and may pursue selected business or product acquisition    opportunities that we believe may provide us with certain    operating and financial benefits. If we complete any such    acquisitions, they may require integration into our existing    business with respect to administrative, financial, sales and    marketing, manufacturing and other functions to realize these    anticipated benefits. If we are unable to successfully integrate    a business or product acquisition, we may not realize the    benefits identified in our due diligence process, and our    financial results may be negatively impacted. Additionally,    significant unexpected liabilities may arise during or after    completion of an acquisition"
10,BMI,BADGER METER INC,2009-03-04,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS"" --> ITEM 1A.  RISK    FACTORS     Shareholders, potential investors and other readers are urged to    consider the significant business risks described below in    addition to the other information set forth or incorporated by    reference in this 2008 Annual Report on    Form 10-K.    If any of the events contemplated by the following risks    actually occur, our financial condition or results of operations    could be materially adversely affected. The following list of    risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually    changing business, economic and geopolitical environment, and    new risk factors may emerge from time to time. We can neither    predict these new risk factors with certainty nor assess the    precise impact, if any, on the business, or the extent to which    any factor, or combination of factors, may cause the actual    results of operations to differ materially. While there is much    uncertainty, we do analyze the risks we face, perform a    probability assessment of their impacts and attempt to soften    their potential impact when and if possible. Competitive    pressures in the marketplace could decrease revenues and    profits:     Competitive pressures in the marketplace for our products could    adversely affect our competitive position, leading to a possible    loss of market share or a decrease in prices, either of which    could result in decreased revenues and profits. We operate in an    environment where competition varies from moderate to intense    and a number of our competitors have greater financial    resources. Our competitors also include alliance partners that    sell products that do or may compete with our products,    particularly those that provide AMR or AMI connectivity    solutions. The principal elements of competition for our most    significant product lines, residential and commercial water    meters for the utility market (with various AMR/AMI technology    systems), are price, product technology, quality and service.    The competitive environment is also affected by the movement    toward AMR or AMI technologies away from manual read meters, the    demand for replacement units and, to some extent such things as    the length and severity of the current global economic downturn,    the ability of municipal water utility customers to authorize    and finance purchases of our products, our ability to obtain    financing, housing starts in the United States, and overall    industrial activity. For our industrial products, the    competitive environment is affected by the general economic    health of various industrial sectors particularly in the United    States and Europe. Technological    developments could harm future success:     We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our    ability to develop technologically advanced products that meet    or exceed appropriate industry standards. Although we believe    that we currently have a competitive advantage in this area,    maintaining such advantage will require continued investment in    research and development, sales and marketing. There can be no    assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such    investments or that we will be able to make the technological    advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantage. If we    are unable to maintain such competitive advantage, our future    financial performance may be adversely affected. We are not    currently aware of any emerging standards or new products that    could render our existing products obsolete. The    inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and    component parts could decrease profit margins and negatively    impact timely delivery to customers:     We are affected by the availability and prices for raw    materials, including metal or alloys (such as bronze, which uses    copper as its main component, aluminum, stainless steel, cast    iron, brass and stellite), plastic resins,    5     glass, microprocessors and other electronic subassemblies, and    components that are used in the manufacturing process. The    inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and    component parts for our products at favorable prices could have    a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition    or results of operations by decreasing profit margins and by    negatively impacting timely deliveries to customers. In the    past, we have been able to offset increases in raw materials and    component parts by increased sales prices, active materials    management, product engineering programs and the diversity of    materials used in the production processes. However, we cannot    be certain that we will be able to accomplish this in the    future. Since we do not control the actual production of these    raw materials and component parts, there may be delays caused by    interruption in the production of these materials for reasons    that are beyond our control. World commodity markets and    inflation may also affect raw material and component part prices. The    length and severity of the current economic downturn could cause    a material adverse impact on sales and operating    results:     As a supplier of products primarily to water utilities, we may    be adversely affected by the length and severity of the current    global economic downturn that affects independent distributors,    large city utilities, private water companies and numerous    smaller municipal water utilities. These customers may delay    capital projects, including non-critical maintenance and    upgrades, or not have the ability to authorize and finance    purchases during economic downturns or instability in world    markets. While we also serve several industrial markets to    reduce our dependency on the water utility market, a significant    downturn in these markets could also cause a material adverse    impact on sales and operating results. Therefore, the continued    downturn in general economic conditions, as well as in our    customers markets, could result in a reduction in demand    for our products and services and could harm the business. Failure    to manufacture quality products could have a material adverse    effect on our business:     If we fail to maintain and enforce quality control and testing    procedures, our products will not meet the performance standards    in the industry. Product quality and performance are a priority    for us since our products are used in various industries where    precise control of fluids is essential, and we believe we have a    very good reputation for product quality. Substandard products    would seriously harm our reputation, resulting in both a loss of    current customers to competitors and damage to our ability to    attract new customers. In addition, if any of our products    proves to be defective, we may be required to participate in a    recall involving such products. A successful claim brought    against us with respect to a defective product in excess of    available insurance coverage, if any, or a requirement to    participate in a major product recall, could have a material    adverse effect on our business, results of operations or    financial condition. Litigation    against us could be costly, time consuming to defend and could    adversely affect profitability:     From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and    claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. We may    also be subject to workers compensation claims, employment    disputes, unfair labor practice charges, customer and supplier    disputes, product liability claims and contractual disputes    related to warranties arising out of the conduct of our    business. Litigation may result in substantial costs and may    divert managements attention and resources, which could    adversely affect our profitability or financial condition. Changes    in environmental or regulatory requirements could entail    additional expenses that could decrease    profitability:     We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future    environmental or regulatory requirements to which our operations    might be subject or the manner in which existing or future laws    will be administered or interpreted. Compliance with such laws    or regulations may entail additional expenses that could    decrease profitability. We are subject to a variety of    environmental laws, such as lead content in certain meters    incorporating brass housings, and regulatory laws affecting the    use and/or    licensing of radio frequencies necessary for AMR/AMI products,    as well as regulations related to customs and trade practices.    Currently, the cost of complying with existing laws is included    as part of our on-going expenses and does not have a material    effect on our business or financial position.    6 Risks    related to foreign markets could decrease    profitability:     Since we sell products worldwide as well as manufacture products    in several countries, we are subject to risks associated with    doing business internationally. These risks include changes in    foreign currency exchange rates, changes in a specific    countrys or regions political or economic    conditions, potentially negative consequences from changes in    tax laws or regulatory requirements, differing labor    regulations, and the difficulty of managing widespread    operations. Operational    dependence on attracting and retaining skilled employees could    negatively impact growth and decrease    profitability:     Our success depends on our continued ability to identify,    attract, develop and retain skilled personnel throughout our    organization. Current and future compensation arrangements,    including benefits, may not be sufficient to attract new    employees or retain existing employees, which may hinder our    growth. In addition, we estimate liabilities and expenses for    pensions and other postretirement benefits that require the use    of assumptions relating to the rates used to discount the future    estimated liability, rate of return on any assets and various    assumptions related to the age and cost of the workforce. Actual    results may differ from the estimates and have a material    adverse effect on future results of operations or on the    financial statements as a whole. Rising healthcare and    retirement benefit costs in the United States may also add to    cost pressures and decrease our profitability. Risks    to the Companys reputation could adversely affect    success:     The Company has a history of good corporate governance,    including procedures and processes that existed prior to the    enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as related    rules and regulations, such as board committee charters, and a    Code of Business Conduct that defines how employees interact    with various Company stakeholders and addresses issues such as    confidentiality, conflict of interest and fair dealing. Failure    to maintain this reputation could have a material adverse effect    on our business and results of operations. Failure    to successfully integrate acquired businesses or products in the    future could adversely affect the operations:     As part of our business strategy, we will continue to evaluate    and may pursue selected business or product acquisition    opportunities that we believe may provide us with certain    operating and financial benefits. If we complete any such    acquisitions, they may require integration into our existing    business with respect to administrative, financial, sales and    marketing, manufacturing and other functions to realize these    anticipated benefits. If we are unable to successfully integrate    a business or product acquisition, we may not realize the    benefits identified in our due diligence process, and our    financial results may be negatively impacted.

Thesecustomers may delay capital projects, including non-criticalmaintenance and upgrades, during economic downturns. While wealso serve several industrial markets to avoid a dependency onany one, a significant downturn in these markets could alsocause a material adverse impact on sales and operating results.     The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 and theresulting war on terrorism caused instability in world markets,which, we believe, temporarily impacted product purchases in theindustry. Therefore, any significant downturn in generaleconomic conditions, as well as in our customers markets,could result in a reduction in demand for our products andservices and could harm the business.Failure to manufacture quality products could impact theability to attract and retain customers, which could have amaterial adverse effect on revenues and profitability:     If we fail to maintain and enforce quality control and testingprocedures, our products will not meet the performance standardsin the industry.
