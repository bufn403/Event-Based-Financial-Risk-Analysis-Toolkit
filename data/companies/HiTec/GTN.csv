9,GTN,GRAY TELEVISION INC,2024-02-23,"RISK FACTORS  In addition to the other information contained in, incorporated by reference into or otherwise referred to in this annual report on Form 10-K, you should consider carefully the following factors when evaluating our business. Any of these risks, or the occurrence of any of the events described in these risk factors, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and the results of operations. In addition, other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently do not deem material could arise, any of which could also materially adversely affect us. This annual report on Form 10-K also contains and incorporates by reference forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the occurrence of one or more of the following risk factors.        13                   Risks Related to Our Business Operating Risks The success of our business is dependent upon advertising revenues, which are seasonal and cyclical, and also fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our main source of revenue is the sale of advertising time and space. Our ability to sell advertising time and space depends on, among other things:   ●  economic conditions in the areas where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole;    ●  the popularity of the programming offered by our television stations;    ●  changes in the population demographics in the areas where our stations are located;    ●  local and national advertising price fluctuations, which can be affected by the availability of programming, the popularity of programming, and the relative supply of and demand for commercial advertising;    ●  our competitors’ activities, including increased competition from other advertising-based mediums, particularly digital platforms, cable networks, MVPDs and other internet companies;    ●  the duration and extent of any network preemption of regularly scheduled programming for any reason;    ●  decisions by advertisers to withdraw or delay planned advertising expenditures for any reason;    ●  the competitiveness of local, regional, and federal elections and ballot initiatives;    ●  labor disputes or other disruptions at major national advertisers, programming providers or networks; and    ●  other factors beyond our control.         14                   Our results are also subject to seasonal and cyclical fluctuations. Seasonal fluctuations typically result in higher revenue and broadcast operating income in the second and fourth quarters rather than in the first and third quarters of each year. This seasonality is primarily attributable to advertisers’ increased expenditures in the spring and in anticipation of holiday season spending in the fourth quarter and an increase in television viewership during these periods. In addition, we typically experience fluctuations in our revenue and broadcast operating income between even-numbered and odd-numbered years. In years in which there are impending elections for various state and national offices, which primarily occur in even-numbered years, political advertising revenue tends to increase, often significantly, and particularly during presidential election years. We consider political broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned from the sale of advertising to political candidates, political parties and special interest groups of advertisements broadcast by our stations that contain messages primarily focused on elections and/or public policy issues. In even-numbered years, we typically derive a material portion of our broadcast advertising revenue from political broadcast advertisers. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we derived approximately 2% and 14%, respectively, of our total revenue from political broadcast advertisers. If political broadcast advertising revenues declined, especially in an even-numbered year, our results of operations and financial condition could also be materially adversely affected. Also, our stations affiliated with the NBC Network broadcast Olympic Games and typically experience increased viewership and revenue during those broadcasts. As a result of the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenue and broadcast operating income, and the historically significant increase in our revenue and broadcast operating income during even-numbered years, it has been, and is expected to remain, difficult to engage in period-over-period comparisons of our revenue and results of operations. Continued uncertain financial and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Financial and economic conditions continue to be uncertain over the longer term and the continuation or worsening of such conditions could reduce consumer confidence and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. If consumer confidence were to decline, this decline could negatively affect our advertising customers’ businesses and their advertising budgets. In addition, volatile economic conditions could have a negative impact on our industry or the industries of our customers who advertise on our stations, resulting in reduced advertising sales. Furthermore, it may be possible that actions taken by any governmental or regulatory body for the purpose of stabilizing the economy or financial markets will not achieve their intended effect. In addition to any negative direct consequences to our business or results of operations arising from these financial and economic developments, some of these actions may adversely affect financial institutions, capital providers, advertisers or other consumers on whom we rely, including for access to future capital or financing arrangements necessary to support our business. Our inability to obtain financing in amounts and at times necessary could make it more difficult or impossible to meet our obligations or otherwise take actions in our best interests. Our dependence upon a limited number of advertising categories could adversely affect our business. We consider broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned primarily from the sale of advertisements broadcast by our stations. Although no single customer represented more than 5% of our broadcast advertising revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we derived a material portion of non-political broadcast advertising revenue from advertisers in a limited number of industries, particularly the services sector, comprising financial, legal and medical advertisers, and the automotive industry. The services sector has become an increasingly important source of advertising revenue over the past few years. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 approximately 27%, 28% and 29%, respectively, of our broadcast advertising revenue (excluding political advertising revenue) was obtained from advertising sales to the services sector. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 approximately 20%, 17% and 17%, respectively, of our broadcast advertising revenue (excluding political advertising revenue) was obtained from advertising sales to automotive customers. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if broadcast advertising revenue from the services sector, automotive or certain other industries, such as the medical, restaurant, communications, or furniture and appliances industries, declined.        15                   We intend to continue to evaluate growth opportunities through strategic acquisitions, and there are significant risks associated with an acquisition strategy. We intend to continue to evaluate opportunities for growth through selective acquisitions of television stations or station groups, subject to our commitment to reducing our leverage ratio over time. There can be no assurances that we will be able to identify any suitable acquisition candidates, and we cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing or completing any acquisitions, or what the consequences of not completing any acquisitions would be. Consummation of any proposed acquisition at any time may also be subject to various conditions such as compliance with FCC rules and policies. Consummation of acquisitions may also be subject to antitrust or other regulatory requirements. In addition, as we operate in a highly regulated industry, we could be subject to litigation, government investigations and enforcement actions on a variety of matters, the result of which could limit our acquisition strategy. An acquisition strategy involves numerous other risks, including risks associated with:   ●  identifying suitable acquisition candidates and negotiating definitive purchase agreements on satisfactory terms;    ●  integrating operations and systems and managing a large and geographically diverse group of stations;    ●  obtaining financing to complete acquisitions, which financing may not be available to us at times, in amounts, or at rates acceptable to us, if at all, and potentially the related risks associated with increased debt;    ●  diverting our management’s attention from other business concerns;    ●  potentially losing key employees; and    ●  potential changes in the regulatory approval process that may make it materially more expensive, or materially delay our ability, to consummate any proposed acquisitions.  Our failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates, or to complete any acquisitions and integrate any acquired business, or to obtain the expected benefits therefrom, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may fail to realize any benefits and incur unanticipated losses related to any acquisition. The success of any strategic acquisition depends, in part, on our ability to successfully combine the acquired business and assets with our business and our ability to successfully manage the assets so acquired. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition. Successful integration may also be hampered by any differences between the operations and corporate culture of the two organizations. Additionally, general market and economic conditions may inhibit our successful integration of any business. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of an acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Finally, any cost savings that are realized may be offset by losses in revenues from the acquired business, any assets or operations disposed of in connection therewith or otherwise, or charges to earnings in connection with such acquisitions.        16                   We must purchase television programming in advance of knowing whether a particular show will be popular enough for us to recoup our costs. One of our most significant costs is for the purchase of television programming. If a particular program is not sufficiently popular among audiences in relation to the cost we pay for such program, we may not be able to sell enough related advertising time for us to recover the costs we pay to broadcast the program. We also must usually purchase programming several years in advance, and we may have to commit to purchase more than one year’s worth of programming, resulting in the incurrence of significant costs in advance of our receipt of any related revenue. We may also replace programs that are performing poorly before we have recaptured any significant portion of the costs we incurred in obtaining such programming or fully expensed the costs for financial reporting purposes. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues, result in the incurrence of impairment charges, or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues. We are highly dependent upon our network affiliations, and our business and results of operations may be materially affected if a network: (i) terminates its affiliation with us; (ii) significantly changes the economic terms and conditions of any future affiliation agreements with us; or (iii) significantly changes the type, quality or quantity of programming provided to us under an affiliation agreement. Our business depends in large part on the success of our network affiliations. One or more stations in each of our operating markets are affiliated with at least one of the four major broadcast networks pursuant to individual affiliation agreements. Each affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the affiliated network during the term of the related agreement. Our affiliation agreements generally expire at various dates between year-end 2024 and January 1, 2026 (with respect to Big Four networks). If we cannot enter into affiliation agreements to replace any agreements in advance of their expiration, we would no longer be able to carry the affiliated network’s programming. This loss of programming would require us to create and/or obtain replacement programming. Such replacement programming may involve higher costs and may not be as attractive to our target audiences, thereby reducing our ability to generate advertising revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. On the other hand, replacement programming may provide additional advertising inventory than that provided to affiliated stations by their networks. Our concentration of CBS and/or NBC affiliates makes us particularly sensitive to adverse changes in our business relationship with, and the general success of, CBS and/or NBC. If we are able to renew or replace existing affiliation agreements, we can give no assurance that any future affiliation agreements will have economic terms or conditions equivalent to or more advantageous to us than our current agreements. If in the future a network or networks impose more adverse economic terms upon us, such event or events could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, if we are unable to renew or replace any existing affiliation agreements, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations under our existing or any future retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs and/or secure payment of retransmission consent fees under such agreements. Furthermore, if in the future a network limited or removed our ability to retransmit network programming to MVPDs, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations or criteria for fees under any existing or any future retransmission consent agreements. In either case, such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.        17                   We are also dependent upon our retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs, and we cannot predict the outcome of potential regulatory changes to the retransmission consent regime. We are also dependent, in significant part, on our retransmission consent agreements. Our current retransmission consent agreements expire at various times over the next several years. No assurances can be provided that we will be able to renegotiate all of such agreements on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. The failure to renegotiate such agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our ability to successfully negotiate future retransmission consent agreements may be hindered by potential legislative or regulatory changes to the framework under which these agreements are negotiated. The FCC has taken actions to implement various provisions of the STELAR Reauthorization Act of 2014 affecting the carriage of television stations, including (i) adopting rules that allow for the modification of satellite television markets in order to ensure that satellite operators carry the broadcast stations of most interest to their communities; (ii) tightening its rules on joint retransmission consent negotiations to prohibit joint negotiations by stations in the same market unless those stations are commonly controlled; (iii) prohibiting a television station from limiting the ability of an MVPD to carry into its local market television signals that are deemed significantly viewed; and (iv) eliminating the “sweeps prohibition,” which had precluded cable operators from deleting or repositioning local commercial television stations during “sweeps” ratings periods. We currently are not a party to any agreements that delegate our authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any of our television stations or grant us authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any other television station. Nevertheless, we cannot predict how the FCC’s restrictions on joint negotiations might impact future opportunities. The FCC also has sought comment on whether it should modify or eliminate the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. If, however, the FCC eliminates or relaxes its rules enforcing our program exclusivity rights, it could affect our ability to negotiate future retransmission consent agreements, and it could harm our ratings and advertising revenue if cable and satellite operators import duplicative programming. In addition, certain OVDs have explored streaming broadcast programming over the internet without approval from or payments to the broadcaster. The majority of federal courts have issued preliminary injunctions enjoining these OVDs from streaming broadcast programming. Separately, on December 19, 2014, the FCC issued an NPRM proposing to classify certain OVDs as MVPDs for purposes of certain FCC carriage rules. If the FCC adopts its proposal, OVDs would need to negotiate for consent from broadcasters before they retransmit broadcast signals. We cannot predict whether the FCC will adopt its proposal or other modified rules that might weaken our rights to negotiate with OVDs. In December 2019, Congress adopted the Satellite Television Community Protection and Promotion Act of 2019 and the Television Viewer Protection Act of 2019 (the “TVPA of 2019”). Among other things, these acts (i) made permanent the copyright license set out in Section 119 of the Copyright Act; (ii) limited eligibility for use of the Section 119 license to retransmit the signals of network television broadcast stations to unserved households to those satellite operators who provide local-into-local service to all DMAs; and (iii) modified the definition of unserved households to those households located in a “short market” (which, in turn, was defined as a local market in which programming of one or more of the top four networks is not offered on either the primary or multicast stream by any network station in that market). The TVPA of 2019 also made permanent the requirement that broadcasters and MVPDs negotiate in good faith and adds a provision that will (i) allow MVPDs to designate a buying group to negotiate retransmission consent agreements on their behalf and (ii) require large stations groups, including ours, to negotiate in good faith with a qualified MVPD buying group.        18                   Congress continues to consider various changes to the statutory scheme governing retransmission of broadcast programming. Some of the proposed bills would make it more difficult to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with large MVPDs and would weaken our leverage to seek market-based compensation for our programming. We cannot predict whether any of these proposals will become law, and, if any do, we cannot determine the effect that any statutory changes would have on our business. We may be unable to maintain or increase our digital advertising revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. We generate a meaningful portion of our advertising revenue from the sale of advertisements on our digital platforms and through the sale of inventory on digital platforms owned by third parties. Our ability to maintain and increase this advertising revenue is largely dependent upon the number of users actively visiting the internet sites, digital apps, and platforms and our arrangements that allow us to sell and service such inventory. Because digital advertising techniques are evolving, if our content, technology and/or advertisement-serving techniques do not evolve to meet the changing needs of advertisers, our advertising revenue could decline. Changes in our business model, advertising inventory or initiatives could also cause a decrease in our digital advertising revenue. We do not have long-term agreements with most of our digital advertisers. Any termination, change or decrease in our relationships with our largest digital advertising clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. If we do not maintain or increase our digital advertising revenue, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Cybersecurity incidents impacting our information technology infrastructure or those of our third-party service providers could interfere with our operations, compromise client information and expose us to liability, possibly causing our business and reputation to suffer. We rely on technology and data owned or controlled by us or our third-party service providers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. Our revenues are increasingly dependent on digital products and access to systems and data. Such use exposes us to cybersecurity threats arising from a variety of causes, including from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These cybersecurity incidents could include, but are not limited to, unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, data corruption or operational disruption. If we are subject to a cybersecurity incident, it could result in business interruption, disclosure of nonpublic information, decreased advertising revenues, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation or investigations, financial consequences and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence, among other things, any or all of which could materially adversely affect our business. While we have experienced a cybersecurity incident in the past, and may experience additional cybersecurity incidents in the future, we are not aware of any cybersecurity incident having a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition to date. However, there can be no assurance that we will not experience future cybersecurity incidents that may be material. Although we have systems and processes in place to try to protect against risks associated with cybersecurity incidents in the future, depending on the nature of an cybersecurity incident, these protections may not be fully sufficient. In addition, because techniques used in cybersecurity threats change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. A cybersecurity incident may not be detected until well after it occurs and the severity and potential impact may not be fully known for a substantial period of time after it has been discovered.        19                   Industry Risks We operate in a highly competitive environment. Competition occurs on multiple levels (for audiences, programming and advertisers) and is based on a variety of factors. If we are not able to successfully compete in all relevant aspects, our revenues will be materially adversely affected. Television stations compete for audiences, certain programming (including news) and advertisers. Signal coverage and carriage on MVPD systems also materially affect a television station’s competitive position. With respect to audiences, stations compete primarily based on broadcast program popularity. We cannot provide any assurances as to the acceptability by audiences of any of the programs we broadcast. Further, because we compete with other broadcast stations for certain programming, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain any desired programming at costs that we believe are reasonable. Cable-network programming, combined with increased access to cable, satellite TV, internet-delivered multichannel video programming distributors (“vMVPDs”), as well as internet video services (such as YouTube) and internet streaming channels and services including subscription video on demand (“SVOD”) and advertising video on demand (“AVOD”) have become significant competitors for television programming viewers. Cable networks’ viewership and advertising share have been declining in recent years, while streaming viewership has accelerated and recently surpassed the combined viewership of broadcast and cable-network programming combined. Further increases in the advertising share of cable networks, internet video services, and internet streaming channels and services could materially adversely affect the advertising revenue of our television stations. In addition, new technologies and methods of buying advertising present an additional competitive challenge, as competitors may offer products and services such as the ability to purchase advertising programmatically or bundled offline and online advertising, aimed at more efficiently capturing advertising spend. The number of viewers and ratings of our television stations and advertising revenues in general may be impacted by viewers moving to these programming alternatives and alternate media content providers, and by eliminating or reducing subscriptions to traditional MVPD services ( “cord cutting” and “cord shaving,” respectively). As these programming alternatives continue to drive changes in consumer behavior and other consumption strategies, our business and results of operations may be materially affected. Our inability or failure to broadcast popular programs, or otherwise maintain viewership for any reason, including as a result of increases in programming alternatives, or our loss of advertising due to technological changes, could result in a lessening of advertisers, or a reduction in the amount advertisers are willing to pay us to advertise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Risks Related to Our Indebtedness We have substantial debt and have the ability to incur significant additional debt. The principal and interest payment obligations on such debt may restrict our future operations and impair our ability to meet our long-term obligations. Currently, we have a $6.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness, excluding intercompany debt and deferred financing costs. Subject to our ability to meet certain borrowing conditions under our Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Senior Credit Facility”), we have the ability to incur significant additional debt, including secured debt under our $625 million revolving credit facility. The terms of the indenture (the “2031 Notes Indenture”) governing our outstanding 5.375% senior notes due 2031 (the “2031 Notes”), the indenture (the “2030 Notes Indenture”) governing our outstanding 4.750% senior notes due 2030 (the “2030 Notes”), the indenture (the “2027 Notes Indenture”) governing our outstanding 7.0% senior notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”) and the indenture (the “2026 Notes Indenture”) governing our outstanding 5.875% senior notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) and, together with the 2031 Notes Indenture, the 2030 Notes Indenture and the 2027 Notes Indenture, the “Existing Indentures” or the “Indentures” also permit us to incur additional indebtedness, subject to our ability to meet certain borrowing conditions.        20                   Our substantial debt may have important consequences. For instance, it could:   ●  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt, which would reduce funds available for other business purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments;    ●  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors that may have less debt and better access to capital resources;    ●  limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes; and    ●  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations.  Our ability to service our significant financial obligations depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow. This is partially subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, that future borrowings will be available to us under our Senior Credit Facility or any other credit facilities, or that we will be able to complete any necessary financings, in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our operations or pay our debts and other obligations, or to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts, at times or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Specifically, volatility in the capital markets may also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, or to refinance our existing debt, on terms or at times favorable to us. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to service our debt or other obligations, which could result in us being in default thereon, in which circumstances our lenders could cease making loans to us, and lenders or other holders of our debt could accelerate and declare due all outstanding obligations due under the respective agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on us. The agreements governing our various debt obligations impose restrictions on our operations and limit our ability to undertake certain corporate actions. The agreements governing our various debt obligations, including our Senior Credit Facility and the Existing Indentures, include covenants imposing significant restrictions on our operations. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These covenants place, or will place, restrictions on our ability to, among other things:   ●  incur additional debt, subject to certain limitations;    ●  declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders;         21                     ●  make investments or acquisitions;    ●  create liens or use assets as security in other transactions;    ●  issue guarantees;    ●  merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets;    ●  amend our articles of incorporation or bylaws;    ●  engage in transactions with affiliates; and    ●  purchase, sell or transfer certain assets.  Any of these restrictions and limitations could make it more difficult for us to execute our business strategy. The Existing Indentures and our Senior Credit Facility require us to comply with certain financial ratios or other covenants; our failure to do so would result in a default thereunder, which would have a material adverse effect on us. We are required to comply with certain financial or other covenants under the Existing Indentures and our Senior Credit Facility. Our ability to comply with these requirements may be affected by events affecting our business, but beyond our control, including prevailing general economic, financial and industry conditions. These covenants could have an adverse effect on us by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, investment, acquisition or other corporate opportunities. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the Existing Indentures or our Senior Credit Facility. Upon a default under any of our debt agreements, the lenders or debtholders thereunder could have the right to declare all amounts outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable, which could, in turn, trigger defaults under other debt obligations and could result in the termination of commitments of the lenders to make further extensions of credit under our Senior Credit Facility. If we were unable to repay our secured debt to our lenders, or were otherwise in default under any provision governing our outstanding secured debt obligations, our secured lenders could proceed against us and our subsidiary guarantors and against the collateral securing that debt. Any default resulting in an acceleration of outstanding indebtedness, a termination of commitments under our financing arrangements or lenders proceeding against the collateral securing such indebtedness would likely result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly. Borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If the rates on which our borrowings are based were to increase from current levels, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available to service our other obligations would decrease.        22                   To partially mitigate this risk, we have entered into interest rate caps pursuant to an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (""ISDA"") Master Agreement with two counterparties. The interest rate caps protect us against adverse fluctuations in interest rates by reducing our exposure to variability in cash flows on a portion of our variable-rate debt. The interest rate caps effectively limit the annual interest charged on our Senior Credit Facility’s current term loans to a maximum of 1-month Term SOFR of 4.97% and 5.015%. We are required to pay aggregate fees in connection with the interest rate caps of approximately $34 million that is due and payable at maturity on December 31, 2025. In 2023, we received $4 million of cash payments from the counterparties that we reclassify to reduce interest expense from the interest rate caps in our consolidated statement of operations. Other Financial Risks We recently have incurred impairment charges on our goodwill, other intangible assets and investments. In prior periods we have incurred impairment charges on our broadcast licenses. Any such future charges may have a material effect on the value of our total assets. As of December 31, 2023, the book value of our broadcast licenses was $5.3 billion and the book value of our goodwill was $2.6 billion, in comparison to total assets of $10.6 billion. During 2023, as a result of the bankruptcy of Diamond Sports Group, LLC (“Diamond”), our production companies segment recorded a non-cash charge of $43 million, for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets.   Also, during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we have recognized impairment charges of $29 million and $18 million, respectively, related to investments. These impairment charges were recorded upon our determination that the fair value of the investments had declined on an other-than-temporary basis or that the recorded value was not recoverable. Not less than annually, and more frequently if necessary, we are required to evaluate our goodwill and broadcast licenses to determine if the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value. If the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value, we will be required to record a non-cash expense to write down the book value of the intangible asset to the estimated fair value. We cannot make any assurances that any required impairment charges will not have a material adverse effect on our total assets. We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations and we depend on our subsidiaries for cash. We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations, other than our investments in our subsidiaries. Because we are a holding company, we are dependent upon the payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. These payments could be or become subject to dividend or other restrictions under applicable laws in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. Payments by our subsidiaries are also contingent upon the subsidiaries’ earnings. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our financial condition and ability to meet our obligations may be materially adversely affected. Our defined benefit pension plan obligations are currently funded, however, if certain factors worsen, we may have to make significant cash payments, which could reduce the cash available for our business. We have funded obligations under our defined benefit pension plans. Notwithstanding that the Gray Pension Plan is frozen with regard to any future benefit accruals, the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of certain market interest rates and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations. Unfavorable returns on the plan’s assets or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations may materially change the timing and amount of required plan funding, which could reduce the cash available for our business. In addition, any future decreases in the discount rate used to determine pension obligations could result in an increase in the valuation of pension obligations, which could affect the reported funding status of our pension plans and future contributions.        23                   Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Equity Securities The price and trading volume of our equity securities may be volatile. The price and trading volume of our equity securities may be volatile and subject to fluctuations. Some of the factors that could cause fluctuation in the stock price or trading volume of our equity securities include:   ●  general market and economic conditions and market trends, including in the television broadcast industry and the financial markets generally, including levels of key interest rates;    ●  the political, economic and social situation in the United States;    ●  actual or anticipated variations in operating results, including audience share ratings and financial results;    ●  inability to meet projections in revenue;    ●  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments or other business developments;    ●  technological innovations in the television broadcast industry;    ●  adoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;    ●  operations of competitors and the performance of competitors’ common stock;    ●  litigation or governmental action involving or affecting us or our subsidiaries;    ●  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;    ●  recruitment or departure of key personnel;    ●  purchases or sales of blocks of our common stock; and    ●  operating and stock performance of the companies that investors may consider to be comparable.  There can be no assurance that the price of our equity securities will not fluctuate or decline significantly. The stock market in recent years has experienced considerable price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies and that could adversely affect the price of our equity securities, regardless of our operating performance. Stock price volatility might be worse if the trading volume of shares of our equity securities is low. Furthermore, stockholders may initiate securities class action lawsuits if the market price of our equity securities were to decline significantly, which may cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management.        24                   We currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and Class A common stock but this is subject to approval by our Board each quarter. To the extent a potential investor ascribes value to a dividend paying stock, the value of our stock may be correspondingly affected.  Our Board of Directors reinstated a cash or stock dividend on both classes of our common stock beginning in the first quarter of 2021. The timing and amount of any future dividend is at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and they may be subject to limitations or restrictions in our Senior Credit Facility and other financing agreements, including our Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock, we may be, or become, party to. We can provide no assurance when or if any future dividends will be declared on our common stock or Class A common stock. As a result, if and to the extent an investor ascribes value to a dividend paying stock, the value of our common stock or Class A common stock may be correspondingly affected. Anti-takeover provisions contained in our Restated Articles of Incorporation (“Articles”) and our Bylaws, as amended (“Bylaws”), as well as provisions of Georgia law, could impair a takeover attempt. Our Articles and Bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging a prospective acquirer from making a tender offer for our shares of common stock or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. To the extent that these provisions discourage takeover attempts, they could deprive stockholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares. Moreover, these provisions could discourage accumulations of large blocks of common stock, thus depriving stockholders of any advantages which large accumulations of stock might provide. As a Georgia corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Georgia law, including Section 14-2-1132 of the Georgia Business Corporation Code. Section 14-2-1132 prevents some stockholders holding more than 10% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations unless the business combination was approved in advance by our Board of Directors or results in the stockholder holding more than 90% of our outstanding common stock. Any provision of our Articles, our Bylaws or Georgia law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. We have the ability to issue additional preferred stock, which could affect the rights of holders of our common stock and Class A common stock. Including the shares of preferred stock issued in the acquisition of Raycom Media, Inc. (the “Raycom Merger”), our Articles allow our Board of Directors to issue up to 20 million shares of preferred stock and set forth the terms of such preferred stock. The terms of any such preferred stock, if issued, may materially adversely affect the dividend and liquidation rights of holders of our common stock. Holders of our Class A common stock have the right to 10 votes per share on all matters to be voted on by our stockholders and, consequently, the ability to exert significant influence over us. As a result of the 10 to 1 voting rights of holders of our Class A common stock, these stockholders are expected to be able to exert significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including mergers and other material transactions, and may be able to cause or prevent a change in the composition of our Board of Directors or a change in control of our Company that could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock. Certain stockholders or groups of stockholders have the ability to exert significant influence over us. Hilton H. Howell, Jr., our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is the husband of Robin R. Howell, a member of our Board of Directors (collectively with other members of their family, the “Howell-Robinson Family”). As a result of their significant stockholdings and positions on the Board of Directors, the Howell-Robinson Family is able to exert significant influence over our policies and management, potentially in a manner which may not be consistent with the interests of our other stockholders.        25                   Risks Related to Regulatory Matters Federal broadcasting industry regulations limit our operating flexibility. The FCC regulates all television broadcasters, including us. We must obtain FCC approval whenever we (i) apply for a new license; (ii) seek to renew, modify or assign a license; (iii) purchase a broadcast station; and/or (iv) transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries that holds a license. Our FCC licenses are critical to our operations, and we cannot operate without them. We cannot be certain that the FCC will renew these licenses in the future or approve new acquisitions, mergers, divestitures or other business activities. Our failure to renew any licenses upon the expiration of any license term could have a material adverse effect on our business. Federal legislation and FCC rules have changed significantly in recent years and may continue to change. These changes may limit our ability to conduct our business in ways that we believe would be advantageous and may affect our operating results. The FCC can sanction us for programming broadcast on our stations that it finds to be indecent. Over the past several years, the FCC has increased its enforcement efforts regarding broadcast indecency and profanity and the statutory maximum fine for broadcasting indecent material is nearly $500,000 per incident, up to a maximum of more than $4 million for a continuing violation. In June 2012, the Supreme Court decided a challenge to the FCC’s indecency enforcement policies without resolving the scope of the FCC’s ability to regulate broadcast content. In August 2013, the FCC issued a Public Notice seeking comment on whether it should modify its indecency policies. The FCC has not yet issued a decision in this proceeding and the courts remain free to review the FCC’s current policy or any modifications thereto. The outcomes of these proceedings could affect future FCC policies in this area, and we are unable to predict the outcome of any such judicial proceeding, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The FCC’s duopoly restrictions limit our ability to own and operate multiple television stations in the same market. The FCC’s ownership rules generally prohibit us from acquiring an “attributable interest” in two television stations that are located in the same market unless at least one of the stations is not ranked among the top-four stations in the market (the “top-four” prohibition). In December 2023, the FCC adopted two modifications to the top-four prohibition that make it more restrictive. These rule changes will take effect in March, 2024. First, the FCC extended the top-four prohibition to low power television (“LPTV”) stations and multicast streams. As a result of this change, a licensee will be prohibited from acquiring network-affiliated programming of another top-four station in a DMA and then placing that programming on either the multicast stream of a full-power station or a LPTV station in a DMA in which it already owns another top-four rated station. These additional restrictions will apply to transactions entered into after December 26, 2023. Existing combinations will be grandfathered, but may not be transferred or assigned except in compliance with the new rule, or a waiver of the new rule. Second, the FCC modified its methodology for determining a station’s audience share for purposes of the top-four prohibition (and failing station waiver requests) to (i) consider audience share data over a 12-month period immediately preceding the date the application is filed, (ii) expanding the relevant daypart for audience share data significantly, and (iii) requiring the inclusion of audience share data for all free-to-consumer, non-simulcast multicast streams.        26                   In November 2022, the FCC issued a Forfeiture Order finding that Gray’s acquisition of CBS programming from another broadcaster in the Anchorage market for Gray’s station KYES-TV was inconsistent with the local television ownership rule’s “top-four” prohibition given Gray’s ownership of KTUU-TV in the same market (a top-four ranked station) and imposed a fine of $518,283. Gray has brought a judicial challenge to the FCC’s Order, which remains pending. The FCC also considers television Local Marketing Agreements (“LMAs”) (which are agreements under which a television station sells or provides more than 15% of the programming on another same-market television station) as “attributable interests.” Pursuant to the FCC’s ownership rules currently in effect, our ability to expand in our present markets through additional station acquisitions or LMAs may be constrained. The FCC’s National Television Station Ownership Rule limits the maximum number of households we can reach. Under the FCC’s National Television Station Ownership Rule, a single television station owner may not reach more than 39% of United States households through commonly owned television stations, subject to a 50% discount of the number of television households attributable to UHF stations (the “UHF Discount”). In December 2017, the FCC issued an NPRM seeking comment on whether it should modify or eliminate the national cap, including the UHF Discount. This proceeding remains pending. This rule may constrain our ability to expand through additional station acquisitions. Currently our station portfolio reaches approximately 36% of total United States television households, or after applying the UHF discount approximately 25% of total United States television households. The Company is subject to governmental oversight regarding compliance with antitrust law as well as related civil litigation. Various governmental agencies, including the DOJ, have authority to enforce the antitrust laws of the United States in the broadcast television industry. The DOJ has increased its enforcement activities within the industry. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2018, the DOJ filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against six broadcasters, including Raycom and Meredith, alleging an agreement to exchange certain competitively sensitive information relating to advertising sales among certain stations in some local markets. The broadcasters and the DOJ entered into substantially identical consent decrees, which, among other things, prohibits the defendant broadcasters from exchanging competitively sensitive information and impose certain compliance requirements. No party to the settlement agreement, including Raycom and Meredith, admitted to any wrongdoing. In addition, following the public disclosure of the DOJ’s investigation and settlement, various putative class action lawsuits were filed against a number of owners of television stations. The cases have been consolidated in a single multidistrict litigation in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and the plaintiffs’ operative complaint alleges price fixing and unlawful information exchange among the defendants’ advertisement sales teams. We are unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings. For more information on these proceedings, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings.” "
2,GTN,GRAY TELEVISION INC,2023-02-24,"RISK FACTORS  In addition to the other information contained in, incorporated by reference into or otherwise referred to in this annual report on Form 10-K, you should consider carefully the following factors when evaluating our business. Any of these risks, or the occurrence of any of the events described in these risk factors, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and the results of operations. In addition, other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently do not deem material could arise, any of which could also materially adversely affect us. This annual report on Form 10-K also contains and incorporates by reference forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the occurrence of one or more of the following risk factors. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness We have substantial debt and have the ability to incur significant additional debt. The principal and interest payment obligations on such debt may restrict our future operations and impair our ability to meet our long-term obligations. Currently we have a $6.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness, excluding intercompany debt and deferred financing costs. Subject to our ability to meet certain borrowing conditions under our Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Senior Credit Facility”), we have the ability to incur significant additional debt, including secured debt under our $500 million revolving credit facility. The terms of the indenture (the “2031 Notes Indenture”) governing our outstanding 5.375% senior notes due 2031 (the “2031 Notes”), the indenture (the “2030 Notes Indenture”) governing our outstanding 4.750% senior notes due 2030 (the “2030 Notes”), the indenture (the “2027 Notes Indenture”) governing our outstanding 7.0% senior notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”) and the indenture (the “2026 Notes Indenture”) governing our outstanding 5.875% senior notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) and, together with the 2031 Notes Indenture, the 2030 Notes Indenture and the 2027 Notes Indenture, the “Existing Indentures” or the “Indentures” also permit us to incur additional indebtedness, subject to our ability to meet certain borrowing conditions. Our substantial debt may have important consequences. For instance, it could:   ●  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt, which would reduce funds available for other business purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments;    ●  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors that may have less debt and better access to capital resources;    ●  limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes; and    ●  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations.         14                   Our ability to service our significant financial obligations depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow. This is partially subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, that future borrowings will be available to us under our Senior Credit Facility or any other credit facilities, or that we will be able to complete any necessary financings, in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our operations or pay our debts and other obligations, or to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts, at times or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Specifically, volatility in the capital markets may also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, or to refinance our existing debt, on terms or at times favorable to us. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to service our debt or other obligations, which could result in us being in default thereon, in which circumstances our lenders could cease making loans to us, and lenders or other holders of our debt could accelerate and declare due all outstanding obligations due under the respective agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on us. The agreements governing our various debt obligations impose restrictions on our operations and limit our ability to undertake certain corporate actions. The agreements governing our various debt obligations, including our Senior Credit Facility and the Existing Indentures, include covenants imposing significant restrictions on our operations. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These covenants place, or will place, restrictions on our ability to, among other things:   ●  incur additional debt, subject to certain limitations;    ●  declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders;    ●  make investments or acquisitions;    ●  create liens or use assets as security in other transactions;    ●  issue guarantees;    ●  merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets;    ●  amend our articles of incorporation or bylaws;    ●  engage in transactions with affiliates; and    ●  purchase, sell or transfer certain assets.  Any of these restrictions and limitations could make it more difficult for us to execute our business strategy. The Existing Indentures and our Senior Credit Facility require us to comply with certain financial ratios or other covenants; our failure to do so would result in a default thereunder, which would have a material adverse effect on us.        15                   We are required to comply with certain financial or other covenants under the Existing Indentures and our Senior Credit Facility. Our ability to comply with these requirements may be affected by events affecting our business, but beyond our control, including prevailing general economic, financial and industry conditions. These covenants could have an adverse effect on us by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, investment, acquisition or other corporate opportunities. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the Existing Indentures or our Senior Credit Facility. Upon a default under any of our debt agreements, the lenders or debtholders thereunder could have the right to declare all amounts outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable, which could, in turn, trigger defaults under other debt obligations and could result in the termination of commitments of the lenders to make further extensions of credit under our Senior Credit Facility. If we were unable to repay our secured debt to our lenders, or were otherwise in default under any provision governing our outstanding secured debt obligations, our secured lenders could proceed against us and our subsidiary guarantors and against the collateral securing that debt. Any default resulting in an acceleration of outstanding indebtedness, a termination of commitments under our financing arrangements or lenders proceeding against the collateral securing such indebtedness would likely result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly. Borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If the rates on which our borrowings are based were to increase from current levels, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available to service our other obligations would decrease. In addition, certain of our variable debt uses the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. In March 2021, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, the administrator of LIBOR, extended the transition dates of certain commonly used LIBOR tenors to June 30, 2023, after which LIBOR reference rates will cease to be provided. Despite this deferral, the LIBOR administrator has advised that no new contracts using U.S. Dollar LIBOR should be entered into after December 31, 2021. It is unknown whether any banks will continue to voluntarily submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR, or whether LIBOR will continue to be published by its administrator based on these submissions, or on any other basis, after June 30, 2023. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a group of market participants convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") as the recommended alternative to LIBOR. The replacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation, reform or replacement may negatively impact the cost of our variable rate debt. Risks Related to Our Business Operating Risks The COVID-19 global pandemic has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business.  The COVID-19 global pandemic negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets over the past three years. At some point during that time period, the COVID-19 global pandemic caused, and, in the future may again cause, adverse impacts on our clients that could result in a decrease in advertising spend and/or heighten the risk with respect to the collectability of our receivables. Consumer spending and changes in advertising generally may also be negatively impacted by general macroeconomic conditions, consumer confidence, supply chain disruptions, macroeconomic inflation and efforts to curtail inflation. All of these factors and more may negatively impact revenues. In addition, disruption of global financial markets as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic and macroeconomic conditions has had, and could in the future, have a negative impact on our ability to access capital and/or access capital at the interest rates that are acceptable to us.        16                   The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on our business, including our ability to execute our near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on numerous evolving factors that we cannot accurately predict or assess, including the the negative impact it has on global and regional economies and economic activity; changes in advertising customers and consumer behavior; and its short and longer-term impact on the levels of consumer confidence. Any of these events could exacerbate the other risks and uncertainties described herein, or in other reports filed with the SEC from time to time, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price. The success of our business is dependent upon advertising revenues, which are seasonal and cyclical, and also fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our main source of revenue is the sale of advertising time and space. Our ability to sell advertising time and space depends on, among other things:   ●  economic conditions in the areas where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole;    ●  the popularity of the programming offered by our television stations;    ●  changes in the population demographics in the areas where our stations are located;    ●  local and national advertising price fluctuations, which can be affected by the availability of programming, the popularity of programming, and the relative supply of and demand for commercial advertising;    ●  our competitors’ activities, including increased competition from other advertising-based mediums, particularly digital platforms, cable networks, MVPDs and other internet companies;    ●  the duration and extent of any network preemption of regularly scheduled programming for any reason;    ●  decisions by advertisers to withdraw or delay planned advertising expenditures for any reason;    ●  labor disputes or other disruptions at major national advertisers, programming providers or networks; and    ●  other factors beyond our control.  Our results are also subject to seasonal and cyclical fluctuations. Seasonal fluctuations typically result in higher revenue and broadcast operating income in the second and fourth quarters rather than in the first and third quarters of each year. This seasonality is primarily attributable to advertisers’ increased expenditures in the spring and in anticipation of holiday season spending in the fourth quarter and an increase in television viewership during these periods. In addition, we typically experience fluctuations in our revenue and broadcast operating income between even-numbered and odd-numbered years. In years in which there are impending elections for various state and national offices, which primarily occur in even-numbered years, political advertising revenue tends to increase, often significantly, and particularly during presidential election years. We consider political broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned from the sale of advertising to political candidates, political parties and special interest groups of advertisements broadcast by our stations that contain messages primarily focused on elections and/or public policy issues. In even-numbered years, we typically derive a material portion of our broadcast advertising revenue from political broadcast advertisers. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we derived approximately 14% and 2%, respectively, of our total revenue from political broadcast advertisers. If political broadcast advertising revenues declined, especially in an even-numbered year, our results of operations and financial condition could also be materially adversely affected. Also, our stations affiliated with the NBC Network broadcast Olympic Games and typically experience increased viewership and revenue during those broadcasts. As a result of the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenue and broadcast operating income, and the historically significant increase in our revenue and broadcast operating income during even-numbered years, it has been, and is expected to remain, difficult to engage in period-over-period comparisons of our revenue and results of operations.        17                   Continued uncertain financial and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Financial and economic conditions continue to be uncertain over the longer term and the continuation or worsening of such conditions could reduce consumer confidence and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. If consumer confidence were to decline, this decline could negatively affect our advertising customers’ businesses and their advertising budgets. In addition, volatile economic conditions could have a negative impact on our industry or the industries of our customers who advertise on our stations, resulting in reduced advertising sales. Furthermore, it may be possible that actions taken by any governmental or regulatory body for the purpose of stabilizing the economy or financial markets will not achieve their intended effect. In addition to any negative direct consequences to our business or results of operations arising from these financial and economic developments, some of these actions may adversely affect financial institutions, capital providers, advertisers or other consumers on whom we rely, including for access to future capital or financing arrangements necessary to support our business. Our inability to obtain financing in amounts and at times necessary could make it more difficult or impossible to meet our obligations or otherwise take actions in our best interests. Our dependence upon a limited number of advertising categories could adversely affect our business. We consider broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned primarily from the sale of advertisements broadcast by our stations. Although no single customer represented more than 5% of our broadcast advertising revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we derived a material portion of non-political broadcast advertising revenue from advertisers in a limited number of industries, particularly the services sector, comprising financial, legal and medical advertisers, and the automotive industry. The services sector has become an increasingly important source of advertising revenue over the past few years. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 approximately 28%, 29% and 28%, respectively, of our broadcast advertising revenue (excluding political advertising revenue) was obtained from advertising sales to the services sector. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 approximately 17%, 17% and 21%, respectively, of our broadcast advertising revenue (excluding political advertising revenue) was obtained from advertising sales to automotive customers. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if broadcast advertising revenue from the services sector, automotive or certain other industries, such as the medical, restaurant, communications, or furniture and appliances industries, declined. We intend to continue to evaluate growth opportunities through strategic acquisitions, and there are significant risks associated with an acquisition strategy. We intend to continue to evaluate opportunities for growth through selective acquisitions of television stations or station groups, subject to our commitment to reducing our leverage ratio over time. There can be no assurances that we will be able to identify any suitable acquisition candidates, and we cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing or completing any acquisitions, or what the consequences of not completing any acquisitions would be. Consummation of any proposed acquisition at any time may also be subject to various conditions such as compliance with FCC rules and policies. Consummation of acquisitions may also be subject to antitrust or other regulatory requirements. In addition, as we operate in a highly regulated industry, we could be subject to litigation, government investigations and enforcement actions on a variety of matters, the result of which could limit our acquisition strategy.        18                   An acquisition strategy involves numerous other risks, including risks associated with:   ●  identifying suitable acquisition candidates and negotiating definitive purchase agreements on satisfactory terms;    ●  integrating operations and systems and managing a large and geographically diverse group of stations;    ●  obtaining financing to complete acquisitions, which financing may not be available to us at times, in amounts, or at rates acceptable to us, if at all, and potentially the related risks associated with increased debt;    ●  diverting our management’s attention from other business concerns;    ●  potentially losing key employees; and    ●  potential changes in the regulatory approval process that may make it materially more expensive, or materially delay our ability, to consummate any proposed acquisitions.  Our failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates, or to complete any acquisitions and integrate any acquired business, or to obtain the expected benefits therefrom, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may fail to realize any benefits and incur unanticipated losses related to any acquisition. The success of any strategic acquisition depends, in part, on our ability to successfully combine the acquired business and assets with our business and our ability to successfully manage the assets so acquired. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition. Successful integration may also be hampered by any differences between the operations and corporate culture of the two organizations. Additionally, general market and economic conditions may inhibit our successful integration of any business. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of an acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Finally, any cost savings that are realized may be offset by losses in revenues from the acquired business, any assets or operations disposed of in connection therewith or otherwise, or charges to earnings in connection with such acquisitions. We must purchase television programming in advance of knowing whether a particular show will be popular enough for us to recoup our costs. One of our most significant costs is for the purchase of television programming. If a particular program is not sufficiently popular among audiences in relation to the cost we pay for such program, we may not be able to sell enough related advertising time for us to recover the costs we pay to broadcast the program. We also must usually purchase programming several years in advance, and we may have to commit to purchase more than one year’s worth of programming, resulting in the incurrence of significant costs in advance of our receipt of any related revenue. We may also replace programs that are performing poorly before we have recaptured any significant portion of the costs we incurred in obtaining such programming or fully expensed the costs for financial reporting purposes. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues, result in the incurrence of impairment charges, or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues.        19                   We are highly dependent upon our network affiliations, and our business and results of operations may be materially affected if a network: (i) terminates its affiliation with us; (ii) significantly changes the economic terms and conditions of any future affiliation agreements with us; or (iii) significantly changes the type, quality or quantity of programming provided to us under an affiliation agreement. Our business depends in large part on the success of our network affiliations. Nearly all of our stations are directly or indirectly affiliated with at least one of the four major broadcast networks pursuant to a separate affiliation agreement. Each affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the affiliated network during the term of the related agreement. Our affiliation agreements generally expire at various dates beginning in the third quarter of 2023 through December 2025. If we cannot enter into affiliation agreements to replace any agreements in advance of their expiration, we would no longer be able to carry the affiliated network’s programming. This loss of programming would require us to seek to obtain replacement programming. Such replacement programming may involve higher costs and may not be as attractive to our target audiences, thereby reducing our ability to generate advertising revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Furthermore, our concentration of CBS and/or NBC affiliates makes us particularly sensitive to adverse changes in our business relationship with, and the general success of, CBS and/or NBC. If we are able to renew or replace existing affiliation agreements, we can give no assurance that any future affiliation agreements will have economic terms or conditions equivalent to or more advantageous to us than our current agreements. If in the future a network or networks impose more adverse economic terms upon us, such event or events could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, if we are unable to renew or replace any existing affiliation agreements, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations under our existing or any future retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs and/or secure payment of retransmission consent fees under such agreements. Furthermore, if in the future a network limited or removed our ability to retransmit network programming to MVPDs, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations or criteria for fees under any existing or any future retransmission consent agreements. In either case, such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are also dependent upon our retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs, and we cannot predict the outcome of potential regulatory changes to the retransmission consent regime. We are also dependent, in significant part, on our retransmission consent agreements. Our current retransmission consent agreements expire at various times over the next several years. No assurances can be provided that we will be able to renegotiate all of such agreements on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. The failure to renegotiate such agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our ability to successfully negotiate future retransmission consent agreements may be hindered by potential legislative or regulatory changes to the framework under which these agreements are negotiated.        20                   The FCC has taken actions to implement various provisions of the STELAR Reauthorization Act of 2014 affecting the carriage of television stations, including (i) adopting rules that allow for the modification of satellite television markets in order to ensure that satellite operators carry the broadcast stations of most interest to their communities; (ii) tightening its rules on joint retransmission consent negotiations to prohibit joint negotiations by stations in the same market unless those stations are commonly controlled; (iii) prohibiting a television station from limiting the ability of an MVPD to carry into its local market television signals that are deemed significantly viewed; and (iv) eliminating the “sweeps prohibition,” which had precluded cable operators from deleting or repositioning local commercial television stations during “sweeps” ratings periods. We currently are not a party to any agreements that delegate our authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any of our television stations or grant us authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any other television station. Nevertheless, we cannot predict how the FCC’s restrictions on joint negotiations might impact future opportunities. The FCC also has sought comment on whether it should modify or eliminate the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. If, however, the FCC eliminates or relaxes its rules enforcing our program exclusivity rights, it could affect our ability to negotiate future retransmission consent agreements, and it could harm our ratings and advertising revenue if cable and satellite operators import duplicative programming. In addition, certain OVDs have explored streaming broadcast programming over the internet without approval from or payments to the broadcaster. The majority of federal courts have issued preliminary injunctions enjoining these OVDs from streaming broadcast programming. Separately, on December 19, 2014, the FCC issued an NPRM proposing to classify certain OVDs as MVPDs for purposes of certain FCC carriage rules. If the FCC adopts its proposal, OVDs would need to negotiate for consent from broadcasters before they retransmit broadcast signals. We cannot predict whether the FCC will adopt its proposal or other modified rules that might weaken our rights to negotiate with OVDs. In December 2019, Congress adopted the Satellite Television Community Protection and Promotion Act of 2019 and the TVPA of 2019. Among other things, these acts (i) made permanent the copyright license set out in Section 119 of the Copyright Act; (ii) limited eligibility for use of the Section 119 license to retransmit the signals of network television broadcast stations to unserved households to those satellite operators who provide local-into-local service to all DMAs; and (iii) modified the definition of unserved households to those households located in a “short market” (which, in turn, was defined as a local market in which programming of one or more of the top four networks is not offered on either the primary or multicast stream by any network station in that market). The TVPA of 2019 also made permanent the requirement that broadcasters and MVPDs negotiate in good faith and adds a provision that will (i) allow MVPDs to designate a buying group to negotiate retransmission consent agreements on their behalf and (ii) require large stations groups, including ours, to negotiate in good faith with a qualified MVPD buying group. Congress continues to consider various changes to the statutory scheme governing retransmission of broadcast programming. Some of the proposed bills would make it more difficult to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with large MVPDs and would weaken our leverage to seek market-based compensation for our programming. We cannot predict whether any of these proposals will become law, and, if any do, we cannot determine the effect that any statutory changes would have on our business. We may be unable to maintain or increase our digital advertising revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. We generate a portion of our advertising revenue from the sale of advertisements on our digital sites. Our ability to maintain and increase this advertising revenue is largely dependent upon the number of users actively visiting our internet sites and using our digital apps. As a result, we must increase user engagement with our internet sites in order to increase our advertising revenue. Because digital advertising techniques are evolving, if our content, technology and advertisement serving techniques do not evolve to meet the changing needs of advertisers, our advertising revenue could also decline. Changes in our business model, advertising inventory or initiatives could also cause a decrease in our internet advertising revenue.        21                   We do not have long-term agreements with most of our digital advertisers. Any termination, change or decrease in our relationships with our largest digital advertising clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. If we do not maintain or increase our digital advertising revenue, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Cybersecurity risks could affect our operating effectiveness. We use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. Our revenues are increasingly dependent on digital products. Such use exposes us to potential cyber incidents resulting from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents could include, but are not limited to, unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, data corruption or operational disruption. The results of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, business interruption, disclosure of nonpublic information, decreased advertising revenues, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation, financial consequences and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence, any or all of which could adversely affect our business. While we have experienced an incident in the past, and may experience additional incidents in the future, we are not aware of any incident having a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition to date. However, there can be no assurance that we will not experience future incidents that may be material. Although we have systems and processes in place to protect against risks associated with cyber incidents in the future, depending on the nature of an incident, these protections may not be fully sufficient. In addition, because techniques used in cybersecurity attacks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. An incident may not be detected until well after it occurs and the severity and potential impact may not be fully known for a substantial period of time after it has been discovered. Industry Risks We operate in a highly competitive environment. Competition occurs on multiple levels (for audiences, programming and advertisers) and is based on a variety of factors. If we are not able to successfully compete in all relevant aspects, our revenues will be materially adversely affected. Television stations compete for audiences, certain programming (including news) and advertisers. Signal coverage and carriage on MVPD systems also materially affect a television station’s competitive position. With respect to audiences, stations compete primarily based on broadcast program popularity. We cannot provide any assurances as to the acceptability by audiences of any of the programs we broadcast. Further, because we compete with other broadcast stations for certain programming, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain any desired programming at costs that we believe are reasonable. Cable-network programming, combined with increased access to cable, satellite TV, and internet video streaming services, has become a significant competitor for broadcast television programming viewers. Cable networks’ viewership and advertising share have increased due to the growth in MVPD and internet video streaming services, penetration (the percentage of television households that are connected to an MVPD or internet video system) and increased investments in programming by cable networks or internet video. Further increases in the advertising share of cable networks and internet video streaming services could materially adversely affect the advertising revenue of our television stations. In addition, technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of programming alternatives, such as internet websites, mobile apps and wireless carriers, direct-to-consumer video distribution systems, and home entertainment systems have further fractionalized television viewing audiences and resulted in additional challenges to revenue generation. New technologies and methods of buying advertising also present an additional competitive challenge, as competitors may offer products and services such as the ability to purchase advertising programmatically or bundled offline and online advertising, aimed at more efficiently capturing advertising spend. The number of viewers and ratings of our television stations and advertising revenues in general may be impacted by viewers moving to these programming alternatives and alternate media content providers, a process known as “cord cutting” and “cord shaving.” As these programming alternatives continue to drive changes in consumer behavior and other consumption strategies our business and results of operations may be materially affected.        22                   Our inability or failure to broadcast popular programs, or otherwise maintain viewership for any reason, including as a result of increases in programming alternatives, or our loss of advertising due to technological changes, could result in a lack of advertisers, or a reduction in the amount advertisers are willing to pay us to advertise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other Financial Risks We have, in the past, incurred impairment charges on our goodwill and/or broadcast licenses, and any such future charges may have a material effect on the value of our total assets. As of December 31, 2022, the book value of our broadcast licenses was $5.3 billion and the book value of our goodwill was $2.7 billion, in comparison to total assets of $11.2 billion. Not less than annually, and more frequently if necessary, we are required to evaluate our goodwill and broadcast licenses to determine if the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value. If the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value, we will be required to record a non-cash expense to write down the book value of the intangible asset to the estimated fair value. We cannot make any assurances that any required impairment charges will not have a material adverse effect on our total assets. We previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, which may result in material misstatements or otherwise adversely affect the accuracy, reliability or timeliness of our financial statements. As described under Item 9A. ""Controls and Procedures"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, we concluded that a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting existed as of December 31, 2021 and, accordingly, internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date. This material weakness related to our controls over user access that did not adequately restrict or provision/deprovision user access related to certain financial reporting programs and did not ensure appropriate segregation of duties as it relates to review. During 2022, we completed the remediation measures related to the material weakness and we have concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective as of December 31, 2022. Completion of remediation does not provide assurance that our remediation or other controls will continue to operate properly. Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting may adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of our financial statements and have other consequences that may materially and adversely affect our business. We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations and we depend on our subsidiaries for cash. We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations, other than our investments in our subsidiaries. Because we are a holding company, we are dependent upon the payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. These payments could be or become subject to dividend or other restrictions under applicable laws in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. Payments by our subsidiaries are also contingent upon the subsidiaries’ earnings. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our financial condition and ability to meet our obligations may be adversely affected.        23                   Our defined benefit pension plan obligations are currently funded, however, if certain factors worsen, we may have to make significant cash payments, which could reduce the cash available for our business. We have funded obligations under our defined benefit pension plans. Notwithstanding that the Gray Pension Plan is frozen with regard to any future benefit accruals, the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of certain market interest rates and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations. Unfavorable returns on the plan’s assets or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations may materially change the timing and amount of required plan funding, which could reduce the cash available for our business. In addition, any future decreases in the discount rate used to determine pension obligations could result in an increase in the valuation of pension obligations, which could affect the reported funding status of our pension plans and future contributions. Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Equity Securities The price and trading volume of our equity securities may be volatile. The price and trading volume of our equity securities may be volatile and subject to fluctuations. Some of the factors that could cause fluctuation in the stock price or trading volume of our equity securities include:   ●  general market and economic conditions and market trends, including in the television broadcast industry and the financial markets generally;    ●  the political, economic and social situation in the United States;    ●  actual or anticipated variations in operating results, including audience share ratings and financial results;    ●  inability to meet projections in revenue;    ●  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments or other business developments;    ●  technological innovations in the television broadcast industry;    ●  adoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;    ●  operations of competitors and the performance of competitors’ common stock;    ●  litigation or governmental action involving or affecting us or our subsidiaries;    ●  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;    ●  recruitment or departure of key personnel;    ●  purchases or sales of blocks of our common stock; and    ●  operating and stock performance of the companies that investors may consider to be comparable.  There can be no assurance that the price of our equity securities will not fluctuate or decline significantly. The stock market in recent years has experienced considerable price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies and that could adversely affect the price of our equity securities, regardless of our operating performance. Stock price volatility might be worse if the trading volume of shares of our equity securities is low. Furthermore, stockholders may initiate securities class action lawsuits if the market price of our equity securities were to decline significantly, which may cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management.        24                   We currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and Class A common stock but this is subject to approval by our Board each quarter. To the extent a potential investor ascribes value to a dividend paying stock, the value of our stock may be correspondingly affected.  Our Board of Directors reinstated a cash or stock dividend on both classes of our common stock beginning in the first quarter of 2021. The timing and amount of any future dividend is at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and they may be subject to limitations or restrictions in our Senior Credit Facility and other financing agreements, including our Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock, we may be, or become, party to. We can provide no assurance when or if any future dividends will be declared on our common stock or Class A common stock. As a result, if and to the extent an investor ascribes value to a dividend paying stock, the value of our common stock or Class A common stock may be correspondingly affected. Anti-takeover provisions contained in our Restated Articles of Incorporation (“Articles”) and our Bylaws, as amended (“Bylaws”), as well as provisions of Georgia law, could impair a takeover attempt. Our Articles and Bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging a prospective acquirer from making a tender offer for our shares of common stock or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. To the extent that these provisions discourage takeover attempts, they could deprive stockholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares. Moreover, these provisions could discourage accumulations of large blocks of common stock, thus depriving stockholders of any advantages which large accumulations of stock might provide. As a Georgia corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Georgia law, including Section 14-2-1132 of the Georgia Business Corporation Code. Section 14-2-1132 prevents some stockholders holding more than 10% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations unless the business combination was approved in advance by our Board of Directors or results in the stockholder holding more than 90% of our outstanding common stock. Any provision of our Articles, our Bylaws or Georgia law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. We have the ability to issue additional preferred stock, which could affect the rights of holders of our common stock and Class A common stock. Including the shares of preferred stock issued in the Raycom Merger, our Articles allow our Board of Directors to issue up to 20 million shares of preferred stock and set forth the terms of such preferred stock. The terms of any such preferred stock, if issued, may adversely affect the dividend and liquidation rights of holders of our common stock. Holders of our Class A common stock have the right to 10 votes per share on all matters to be voted on by our stockholders and, consequently, the ability to exert significant influence over us. As a result of the 10 to 1 voting rights of holders of our Class A common stock, these stockholders are expected to be able to exert significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including mergers and other material transactions, and may be able to cause or prevent a change in the composition of our Board of Directors or a change in control of our Company that could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.        25                   Certain stockholders or groups of stockholders have the ability to exert significant influence over us. Hilton H. Howell, Jr., our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is the husband of Robin R. Howell, a member of our Board of Directors (collectively with other members of their family, the “Howell-Robinson Family”). As a result of their significant stockholdings and positions on the Board of Directors, the Howell-Robinson Family is able to exert significant influence over our policies and management, potentially in a manner which may not be consistent with the interests of our other stockholders. Risks Related to Regulatory Matters Federal broadcasting industry regulations limit our operating flexibility. The FCC regulates all television broadcasters, including us. We must obtain FCC approval whenever we (i) apply for a new license; (ii) seek to renew, modify or assign a license; (iii) purchase a broadcast station; and/or (iv) transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries that holds a license. Our FCC licenses are critical to our operations, and we cannot operate without them. We cannot be certain that the FCC will renew these licenses in the future or approve new acquisitions, mergers, divestitures or other business activities. Our failure to renew any licenses upon the expiration of any license term could have a material adverse effect on our business. Federal legislation and FCC rules have changed significantly in recent years and may continue to change. These changes may limit our ability to conduct our business in ways that we believe would be advantageous and may affect our operating results. The FCC can sanction us for programming broadcast on our stations that it finds to be indecent. Over the past several years, the FCC has increased its enforcement efforts regarding broadcast indecency and profanity and the statutory maximum fine for broadcasting indecent material is more than $500,000 per incident, up to a maximum of more than $4 million for a continuing violation. In June 2012, the Supreme Court decided a challenge to the FCC’s indecency enforcement policies without resolving the scope of the FCC’s ability to regulate broadcast content. In August 2013, the FCC issued a Public Notice seeking comment on whether it should modify its indecency policies. The FCC has not yet issued a decision in this proceeding and the courts remain free to review the FCC’s current policy or any modifications thereto. The outcomes of these proceedings could affect future FCC policies in this area, and we are unable to predict the outcome of any such judicial proceeding, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The FCC’s duopoly restrictions limit our ability to own and operate multiple television stations in the same market. The FCC’s ownership rules generally prohibit us from acquiring an “attributable interest” in two television stations that are located in the same market unless at least one of the stations is not ranked among the top-four stations in the market (the “top-four” prohibition). In November 2017, the FCC released an order that eliminated or relaxed several long-standing media ownership rules, including the requirement that, in addition to compliance with the “top-four” prohibition, common ownership of two stations in a single market was permissible only if eight or more independently-owned television stations would remain in the market (the “eight voices” test). However, in November 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated these rule changes and reinstated the prior, more restrictive, ownership rules, including the “eight voices” test. The Supreme Court of the United States granted the FCC’s petition for certiorari seeking review of the Third Circuit decision; and on April 1, 2021, the Supreme Court reversed the Third Circuit’s decision. As a result of the Supreme Court’s ruling, the FCC’s less restrictive ownership rules became effective on June 30, 2021. In December 2022, the FCC launched a new proceeding to consider whether further changes in the media ownership rules are necessary, which remains pending.        26                   In November 2022, the FCC issued a forfeiture order finding that Gray’s acquisition of CBS programming from another broadcaster in the Anchorage market for Gray’s station KYES-TV was inconsistent with the local television ownership rule’s “top-four” prohibition given Gray’s ownership of KTUU-TV in the same market (a top-four ranked station) and imposed a fine of $518,283. Gray has brought a judicial challenge to the FCC’s order, which remains pending. The FCC also considers television Local Marketing Agreements (“LMAs”) (which are agreements under which a television station sells or provides more than 15% of the programming on another same-market television station) as “attributable interests.” Pursuant to the FCC’s ownership rules currently in effect, our ability to expand in our present markets through additional station acquisitions or LMAs may be constrained. The FCC’s National Television Station Ownership Rule limits the maximum number of households we can reach. Under the FCC’s National Television Station Ownership Rule, a single television station owner may not reach more than 39% of United States households through commonly owned television stations, subject to a 50% discount of the number of television households attributable to UHF stations (the “UHF Discount”). In December 2017, the FCC issued an NPRM seeking comment on whether it should modify or eliminate the national cap, including the UHF Discount. This rule may constrain our ability to expand through additional station acquisitions. Currently our station portfolio reaches approximately 36% of total United States television households, or after applying the UHF discount approximately 25% of total United States television households. The Company is subject to governmental oversight regarding compliance with antitrust law as well as related civil litigation. Various governmental agencies, including the DOJ, have authority to enforce the antitrust laws of the United States in the broadcast television industry. The DOJ has increased its enforcement activities within the industry. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2018, the DOJ filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against six broadcasters, including Raycom and Meredith, alleging an agreement to exchange certain competitively sensitive information relating to advertising sales among certain stations in some local markets. The broadcasters and the DOJ entered into substantially identical consent decrees, which, among other things, prohibits the defendant broadcasters from exchanging competitively sensitive information and impose certain compliance requirements. No party to the settlement agreement, including Raycom and Meredith, admitted to any wrongdoing. In addition, following the public disclosure of the DOJ’s investigation and settlement, various putative class action lawsuits were filed against a number of owners of television stations. The cases have been consolidated in a single multidistrict litigation in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and the Plaintiffs’ operative complaint alleges price fixing and unlawful information exchange among the defendants’ advertisement sales teams. We are unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings. For more information on these proceedings, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings.” "
6,GTN,GRAY TELEVISION INC,2022-02-25,"RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information contained in, incorporated by reference into or otherwise referred to in this annual report on Form 10-K, you should consider carefully the following factors when evaluating our business. Any of these risks, or the occurrence of any of the events described in these risk factors, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and the results of operations. In addition, other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently do not deem material could arise, any of which could also materially adversely affect us. This annual report on Form 10-K also contains and incorporates by reference forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the occurrence of one or more of the following risk factors. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness We have substantial debt and have the ability to incur significant additional debt. The principal and interest payment obligations on such debt may restrict our future operations and impair our ability to meet our long-term obligations. Currently we have approximately $6.8 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness, excluding intercompany debt and deferred financing costs. Subject to our ability to meet certain borrowing conditions under our Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Senior Credit Facility”), we have the ability to incur significant additional debt, including secured debt under our un-drawn $500 million revolving credit facility. The terms of the indenture (the “2031 Notes Indenture”) governing our outstanding 5.375% senior notes due 2031 (the “2031 Notes”), the indenture (the “2030 Notes Indenture”) governing our outstanding 4.750% senior notes due 2030 (the “2030 Notes”), the indenture (the “2027 Notes Indenture”) governing our outstanding 7.0% senior notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”) and the indenture (the “2026 Notes Indenture”) governing our outstanding 5.875% senior notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) and, together with the 2031 Notes Indenture, the 2030 Notes Indenture and the 2027 Notes Indenture, the “Existing Indentures” or the “Indentures”) also permit us to incur additional indebtedness, subject to our ability to meet certain borrowing conditions. Our substantial debt may have important consequences. For instance, it could:   ●  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt, which would reduce funds available for other business purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments;    ●  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors that may have less debt and better access to capital resources;    ●  limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes; and    ●  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations.         14                   Our ability to service our significant financial obligations depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow. This is partially subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, that future borrowings will be available to us under our Senior Credit Facility or any other credit facilities, or that we will be able to complete any necessary financings, in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our operations or pay our debts and other obligations, or to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts, at times or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Specifically, volatility in the capital markets may also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, or to refinance our existing debt, on terms or at times favorable to us. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to service our debt or other obligations, which could result in us being in default thereon, in which circumstances our lenders could cease making loans to us, and lenders or other holders of our debt could accelerate and declare due all outstanding obligations due under the respective agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on us. The agreements governing our various debt obligations impose restrictions on our operations and limit our ability to undertake certain corporate actions. The agreements governing our various debt obligations, including our Senior Credit Facility and the Existing Indentures, include covenants imposing significant restrictions on our operations. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These covenants place, or will place, restrictions on our ability to, among other things:   ●  incur additional debt, subject to certain limitations;    ●  declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders;    ●  make investments or acquisitions;    ●  create liens or use assets as security in other transactions;    ●  issue guarantees;    ●  merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets;    ●  amend our articles of incorporation or bylaws;    ●  engage in transactions with affiliates; and    ●  purchase, sell or transfer certain assets.  Any of these restrictions and limitations could make it more difficult for us to execute our business strategy.        15                   The Existing Indentures and our Senior Credit Facility require us to comply with certain financial ratios or other covenants; our failure to do so would result in a default thereunder, which would have a material adverse effect on us. We are required to comply with certain financial or other covenants under the Existing Indentures and our Senior Credit Facility. Our ability to comply with these requirements may be affected by events affecting our business, but beyond our control, including prevailing general economic, financial and industry conditions. These covenants could have an adverse effect on us by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, investment, acquisition or other corporate opportunities. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the Existing Indentures or our Senior Credit Facility. Upon a default under any of our debt agreements, the lenders or debtholders thereunder could have the right to declare all amounts outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable, which could, in turn, trigger defaults under other debt obligations and could result in the termination of commitments of the lenders to make further extensions of credit under our Senior Credit Facility. If we were unable to repay our secured debt to our lenders, or were otherwise in default under any provision governing our outstanding secured debt obligations, our secured lenders could proceed against us and our subsidiary guarantors and against the collateral securing that debt. Any default resulting in an acceleration of outstanding indebtedness, a termination of commitments under our financing arrangements or lenders proceeding against the collateral securing such indebtedness would likely result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly. Borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If the rates on which our borrowings are based were to increase from current levels, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available to service our other obligations would decrease. Risks Related to Our Business Operating Risks The COVID-19 global pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our business.  The COVID-19 global pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. While the COVID-19 global pandemic had a material adverse impact on our business including our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in 2020, the pandemic impacts were lessened considerably in 2021. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on our business, including our ability to execute our near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on numerous evolving factors that we cannot accurately predict or assess, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; the negative impact it has on global and regional economies and economic activity; changes in advertising customers and consumer behavior; impact of governmental regulations that might be imposed in response to the pandemic; its short and longer-term impact on the levels of consumer confidence; actions governments, businesses and individuals take in response to the pandemic; and how quickly economies recover after the COVID-19 global pandemic subsides. Although we have continued to operate our facilities to date and have taken precautions, consistent with federal guidelines and state and local orders, to protect the safety and well-being of our employees, customers and the general public, the COVID-19 global pandemic and any preventive or protective actions taken by governmental authorities may have a material adverse impact on our workforce and operations. In addition, we may become party to lawsuits related to the risk of exposure to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and/or with respect to the measures we take to protect our workplaces and employees from that coronavirus.        16                   The COVID-19 global pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a widespread and broad reaching effect on the economy and could have adverse impacts on our clients that could result in a decrease in advertising spend and/or heighten the risk with respect to the collectability of our receivables. Consumer spending and changes in advertising generally may also be negatively impacted by general macroeconomic conditions, consumer confidence, supply chain disruptions, macroeconomic inflation, the COVID-19 global pandemic and governmental responses to the pandemic. All of these factors and more may negatively impact revenues. In addition, disruption of global financial markets as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital in the future. The continued impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on our business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as information is rapidly evolving with respect to the duration and severity of the pandemic, mutations of the coronavirus, and the resulting effects on local, national and global economies. At this point, we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of the COVID-19 global pandemic, or its overall impact on our business. Even after the COVID-19 global pandemic subsides, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of macroeconomic forces triggered by pandemic-related conduct by governments, businesses, and individuals. The effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic may also impact financial markets and corporate credit markets which could adversely impact our access to financing or the terms of any such financing. Any of these events could exacerbate the other risks and uncertainties described herein, or in other reports filed with the SEC from time to time, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price. The success of our business is dependent upon advertising revenues, which are seasonal and cyclical, and also fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our main source of revenue is the sale of advertising time and space. Our ability to sell advertising time and space depends on, among other things:   ●  economic conditions in the areas where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole;    ●  the popularity of the programming offered by our television stations;    ●  changes in the population demographics in the areas where our stations are located;    ●  local and national advertising price fluctuations, which can be affected by the availability of programming, the popularity of programming, and the relative supply of and demand for commercial advertising;    ●  our competitors’ activities, including increased competition from other advertising-based mediums, particularly digital platforms, cable networks, MVPDs and other internet companies;    ●  the duration and extent of any network preemption of regularly scheduled programming for any reason;    ●  decisions by advertisers to withdraw or delay planned advertising expenditures for any reason;    ●  labor disputes or other disruptions at major national advertisers, programming providers or networks; and    ●  other factors beyond our control.         17                   Our results are also subject to seasonal and cyclical fluctuations. Seasonal fluctuations typically result in higher revenue and broadcast operating income in the second and fourth quarters rather than in the first and third quarters of each year. This seasonality is primarily attributable to advertisers’ increased expenditures in the spring and in anticipation of holiday season spending in the fourth quarter and an increase in television viewership during these periods. In addition, we typically experience fluctuations in our revenue and broadcast operating income between even-numbered and odd-numbered years. In years in which there are impending elections for various state and national offices, which primarily occur in even-numbered years, political advertising revenue tends to increase, often significantly, and particularly during presidential election years. We consider political broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned from the sale of advertising to political candidates, political parties and special interest groups of advertisements broadcast by our stations that contain messages primarily focused on elections and/or public policy issues. In even-numbered years, we typically derive a material portion of our broadcast advertising revenue from political broadcast advertisers. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we derived approximately 2% and 18%, respectively, of our total revenue from political broadcast advertisers. If political broadcast advertising revenues declined, especially in an even-numbered year, our results of operations and financial condition could also be materially adversely affected. Also, our stations affiliated with the NBC Network broadcast Olympic Games and typically experience increased viewership and revenue during those broadcasts. As a result of the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenue and broadcast operating income, and the historically significant increase in our revenue and broadcast operating income during even-numbered years, it has been, and is expected to remain, difficult to engage in period-over-period comparisons of our revenue and results of operations. Continued uncertain financial and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Financial and economic conditions continue to be uncertain over the longer term and the continuation or worsening of such conditions could reduce consumer confidence and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. If consumer confidence were to decline, this decline could negatively affect our advertising customers’ businesses and their advertising budgets. In addition, volatile economic conditions could have a negative impact on our industry or the industries of our customers who advertise on our stations, resulting in reduced advertising sales. Furthermore, it may be possible that actions taken by any governmental or regulatory body for the purpose of stabilizing the economy or financial markets will not achieve their intended effect. In addition to any negative direct consequences to our business or results of operations arising from these financial and economic developments, some of these actions may adversely affect financial institutions, capital providers, advertisers or other consumers on whom we rely, including for access to future capital or financing arrangements necessary to support our business. Our inability to obtain financing in amounts and at times necessary could make it more difficult or impossible to meet our obligations or otherwise take actions in our best interests. Our dependence upon a limited number of advertising categories could adversely affect our business. We consider broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned primarily from the sale of advertisements broadcast by our stations. Although no single customer represented more than 5% of our broadcast advertising revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we derived a material portion of non-political broadcast advertising revenue from advertisers in a limited number of industries, particularly the services sector, comprising financial, legal and medical advertisers, and the automotive industry. The services sector has become an increasingly important source of advertising revenue over the past few years. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 approximately 29%, 28% and 25% of our broadcast advertising revenue (excluding political advertising revenue) was obtained from advertising sales to the services sector. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 approximately 17%, 21% and 25%, respectively, of our broadcast advertising revenue (excluding political advertising revenue) was obtained from advertising sales to automotive customers. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if broadcast advertising revenue from the services sector, automotive or certain other industries, such as the medical, restaurant, communications, or furniture and appliances industries, declined.        18                   We intend to continue to evaluate growth opportunities through strategic acquisitions, and there are significant risks associated with an acquisition strategy. We intend to continue to evaluate opportunities for growth through selective acquisitions of television stations or station groups. There can be no assurances that we will be able to identify any suitable acquisition candidates, and we cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing or completing any acquisitions, or what the consequences of not completing any acquisitions would be. Consummation of any proposed acquisition at any time may also be subject to various conditions such as compliance with FCC rules and policies. Consummation of acquisitions may also be subject to antitrust or other regulatory requirements. In addition, as we operate in a highly regulated industry, we could be subject to litigation, government investigations and enforcement actions on a variety of matters, the result of which could limit our acquisition strategy. An acquisition strategy involves numerous other risks, including risks associated with:   ●  identifying suitable acquisition candidates and negotiating definitive purchase agreements on satisfactory terms;    ●  integrating operations and systems and managing a large and geographically diverse group of stations;    ●  obtaining financing to complete acquisitions, which financing may not be available to us at times, in amounts, or at rates acceptable to us, if at all, and potentially the related risks associated with increased debt;    ●  diverting our management’s attention from other business concerns;    ●  potentially losing key employees; and    ●  potential changes in the regulatory approval process that may make it materially more expensive, or materially delay our ability, to consummate any proposed acquisitions.  Our failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates, or to complete any acquisitions and integrate any acquired business, or to obtain the expected benefits therefrom, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may fail to realize any benefits and incur unanticipated losses related to any acquisition. The success of any strategic acquisition depends, in part, on our ability to successfully combine the acquired business and assets with our business and our ability to successfully manage the assets so acquired. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition. Successful integration may also be hampered by any differences between the operations and corporate culture of the two organizations. Additionally, general market and economic conditions may inhibit our successful integration of any business. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of an acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Finally, any cost savings that are realized may be offset by losses in revenues from the acquired business, any assets or operations disposed of in connection therewith or otherwise, or charges to earnings in connection with such acquisitions.        19                   We must purchase television programming in advance of knowing whether a particular show will be popular enough for us to recoup our costs. One of our most significant costs is for the purchase of television programming. If a particular program is not sufficiently popular among audiences in relation to the cost we pay for such program, we may not be able to sell enough related advertising time for us to recover the costs we pay to broadcast the program. We also must usually purchase programming several years in advance, and we may have to commit to purchase more than one year’s worth of programming, resulting in the incurrence of significant costs in advance of our receipt of any related revenue. We may also replace programs that are performing poorly before we have recaptured any significant portion of the costs we incurred in obtaining such programming or fully expensed the costs for financial reporting purposes. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues, result in the incurrence of impairment charges or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues. We are highly dependent upon our network affiliations, and our business and results of operations may be materially affected if a network: (i) terminates its affiliation with us; (ii) significantly changes the economic terms and conditions of any future affiliation agreements with us; or (iii) significantly changes the type, quality or quantity of programming provided to us under an affiliation agreement. Our business depends in large part on the success of our network affiliations. Nearly all of our stations are directly or indirectly affiliated with at least one of the four major broadcast networks pursuant to a separate affiliation agreement. Each affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the affiliated network during the term of the related agreement. Our affiliation agreements generally expire at various dates through December 2024. If we cannot enter into affiliation agreements to replace any agreements in advance of their expiration, we would no longer be able to carry the affiliated network’s programming. This loss of programming would require us to seek to obtain replacement programming. Such replacement programming may involve higher costs and may not be as attractive to our target audiences, thereby reducing our ability to generate advertising revenue. Furthermore, our concentration of CBS and/or NBC affiliates makes us particularly sensitive to adverse changes in our business relationship with, and the general success of, CBS and/or NBC. We can give no assurance that any future affiliation agreements will have economic terms or conditions equivalent to or more advantageous to us than our current agreements. If in the future a network or networks impose more adverse economic terms upon us, such event or events could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, if we are unable to renew or replace any existing affiliation agreements, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations under our existing or any future retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs and/or secure payment of retransmission consent fees under such agreements. Furthermore, if in the future a network limited or removed our ability to retransmit network programming to MVPDs, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations or criteria for fees under any existing or any future retransmission consent agreements. In either case, such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.        20                   We are also dependent upon our retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs, and we cannot predict the outcome of potential regulatory changes to the retransmission consent regime. We are also dependent, in significant part, on our retransmission consent agreements. Our current retransmission consent agreements expire at various times over the next several years. No assurances can be provided that we will be able to renegotiate all of such agreements on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. The failure to renegotiate such agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our ability to successfully negotiate future retransmission consent agreements may be hindered by potential legislative or regulatory changes to the framework under which these agreements are negotiated. The FCC has taken actions to implement various provisions of the STELAR Reauthorization Act of 2014 affecting the carriage of television stations, including (i) adopting rules that allow for the modification of satellite television markets in order to ensure that satellite operators carry the broadcast stations of most interest to their communities; (ii) tightening its rules on joint retransmission consent negotiations to prohibit joint negotiations by stations in the same market unless those stations are commonly controlled; (iii) prohibiting a television station from limiting the ability of an MVPD to carry into its local market television signals that are deemed significantly viewed; and (iv) eliminating the “sweeps prohibition,” which had precluded cable operators from deleting or repositioning local commercial television stations during “sweeps” ratings periods. We currently are not a party to any agreements that delegate our authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any of our television stations or grant us authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any other television station. Nevertheless, we cannot predict how the FCC’s restrictions on joint negotiations might impact future opportunities. The FCC also has sought comment on whether it should modify or eliminate the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. If, however, the FCC eliminates or relaxes its rules enforcing our program exclusivity rights, it could affect our ability to negotiate future retransmission consent agreements, and it could harm our ratings and advertising revenue if cable and satellite operators import duplicative programming. In addition, certain OVDs have explored streaming broadcast programming over the internet without approval from or payments to the broadcaster. The majority of federal courts have issued preliminary injunctions enjoining these OVDs from streaming broadcast programming. Separately, on December 19, 2014, the FCC issued an NPRM proposing to classify certain OVDs as MVPDs for purposes of certain FCC carriage rules. If the FCC adopts its proposal, OVDs would need to negotiate for consent from broadcasters before they retransmit broadcast signals. We cannot predict whether the FCC will adopt its proposal or other modified rules that might weaken our rights to negotiate with OVDs. In December 2019, Congress adopted the Satellite Television Community Protection and Promotion Act of 2019 and the TVPA of 2019. Among other things, these acts (i) made permanent the copyright license set out in Section 119 of the Copyright Act; (ii) limited eligibility for use of the Section 119 license to retransmit the signals of network television broadcast stations to unserved households to those satellite operators who provide local-into-local service to all DMAs; and (iii) modified the definition of unserved households to those households located in a “short market” (which, in turn, was defined as a local market in which programming of one or more of the top four networks is not offered on either the primary or multicast stream by any network station in that market). The TVPA of 2019 also made permanent the requirement that broadcasters and MVPDs negotiate in good faith and adds a provision that will (i) allow MVPDs to designate a buying group to negotiate retransmission consent agreements on their behalf and (ii) require large stations groups, including ours, to negotiate in good faith with a qualified MVPD buying group.        21                   Congress continues to consider various changes to the statutory scheme governing retransmission of broadcast programming. Some of the proposed bills would make it more difficult to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with large MVPDs and would weaken our leverage to seek market-based compensation for our programming. We cannot predict whether any of these proposals will become law, and, if any do, we cannot determine the effect that any statutory changes would have on our business. We may be unable to maintain or increase our digital advertising revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. We generate a portion of our advertising revenue from the sale of advertisements on our digital sites. Our ability to maintain and increase this advertising revenue is largely dependent upon the number of users actively visiting our internet sites and using our digital apps. As a result, we must increase user engagement with our internet sites in order to increase our advertising revenue. Because digital advertising techniques are evolving, if our content, technology and advertisement serving techniques do not evolve to meet the changing needs of advertisers, our advertising revenue could also decline. Changes in our business model, advertising inventory or initiatives could also cause a decrease in our internet advertising revenue. We do not have long-term agreements with most of our digital advertisers. Any termination, change or decrease in our relationships with our largest digital advertising clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. If we do not maintain or increase our digital advertising revenue, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Cybersecurity risks could affect our operating effectiveness. We use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. Our revenues are increasingly dependent on digital products. Such use exposes us to potential cyber incidents resulting from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents could include, but are not limited to, unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, data corruption or operational disruption. The results of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, business interruption, disclosure of nonpublic information, decreased advertising revenues, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation, financial consequences and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence, any or all of which could adversely affect our business. While we have experienced an incident in the past, and may experience additional incidents in the future, we are not aware of any incident having a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition to date. However, there can be no assurance that we will not experience future incidents that may be material. Although we have systems and processes in place to protect against risks associated with cyber incidents in the future, depending on the nature of an incident, these protections may not be fully sufficient. Industry Risks We operate in a highly competitive environment. Competition occurs on multiple levels (for audiences, programming and advertisers) and is based on a variety of factors. If we are not able to successfully compete in all relevant aspects, our revenues will be materially adversely affected. Television stations compete for audiences, certain programming (including news) and advertisers. Signal coverage and carriage on MVPD systems also materially affect a television station’s competitive position. With respect to audiences, stations compete primarily based on broadcast program popularity. We cannot provide any assurances as to the acceptability by audiences of any of the programs we broadcast. Further, because we compete with other broadcast stations for certain programming, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain any desired programming at costs that we believe are reasonable. Cable-network programming, combined with increased access to cable, satellite TV, and internet video streaming services, has become a significant competitor for broadcast television programming viewers. Cable networks’ viewership and advertising share have increased due to the growth in MVPD and internet video streaming services, penetration (the percentage of television households that are connected to an MVPD or internet video system) and increased investments in programming by cable networks or internet video. Further increases in the advertising share of cable networks and internet video streaming services could materially adversely affect the advertising revenue of our television stations.        22                   In addition, technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of programming alternatives, such as internet websites, mobile apps and wireless carriers, direct-to-consumer video distribution systems, and home entertainment systems have further fractionalized television viewing audiences and resulted in additional challenges to revenue generation. New technologies and methods of buying advertising also present an additional competitive challenge, as competitors may offer products and services such as the ability to purchase advertising programmatically or bundled offline and online advertising, aimed at more efficiently capturing advertising spend. Our inability or failure to broadcast popular programs, or otherwise maintain viewership for any reason, including as a result of increases in programming alternatives, or our loss of advertising due to technological changes, could result in a lack of advertisers, or a reduction in the amount advertisers are willing to pay us to advertise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other Financial Risks We have, in the past, incurred impairment charges on our goodwill and/or broadcast licenses, and any such future charges may have a material effect on the value of our total assets. As of December 31, 2021, the book value of our broadcast licenses was $5.3 billion and the book value of our goodwill was $2.6 billion, in comparison to total assets of $11.1 billion. Not less than annually, and more frequently if necessary, we are required to evaluate our goodwill and broadcast licenses to determine if the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value. If the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value, we will be required to record a non-cash expense to write down the book value of the intangible asset to the estimated fair value. We cannot make any assurances that any required impairment charges will not have a material adverse effect on our total assets. We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, which may result in material misstatements or otherwise adversely affect the accuracy, reliability or timeliness of our financial statements. As described under Item 9A. ""Controls and Procedures"" below, we have concluded that a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting existed as of December 31, 2021 and, accordingly, internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of management’s evaluation, management identified the material weakness as a result of deficiencies identified in our controls over user access which did not adequately restrict or provision/deprovision user access related to certain financial reporting programs and did not ensure appropriate segregation of duties as it relates to review. Management has begun the process of evaluating the material weaknesses and developing its full remediation plan. Until the remediation plan is implemented, tested and deemed effective we cannot assure you that our actions will adequately remediate the material weaknesses or that additional material weaknesses in our internal controls will not be identified in the future. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable and timely financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to reasonably detect and prevent fraud. The occurrence of, or failure to remediate, this material weakness and any future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may adversely affect the accuracy and reliability and timeliness of our financial statements and have other consequences that could materially and adversely affect our business. We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations and we depend on our subsidiaries for cash. We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations, other than our investments in our subsidiaries. Because we are a holding company, we are dependent upon the payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. These payments could be or become subject to dividend or other restrictions under applicable laws in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. Payments by our subsidiaries are also contingent upon the subsidiaries’ earnings. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our financial condition and ability to meet our obligations may be adversely affected.        23                   Our defined benefit pension plan obligation is currently underfunded, and, if certain factors worsen, we may have to make significant cash payments, which could reduce the cash available for our business. We have underfunded obligations under our defined benefit pension plan. Notwithstanding that our pension plan is frozen with regard to any future benefit accruals, the funded status of our pension plan is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of certain market interest rates and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations. Unfavorable returns on the plan’s assets or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations may materially change the timing and amount of required plan funding, which could reduce the cash available for our business. In addition, any future decreases in the discount rate used to determine pension obligations could result in an increase in the valuation of pension obligations, which could affect the reported funding status of our pension plan and future contributions. Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Equity Securities The price and trading volume of our equity securities may be volatile. The price and trading volume of our equity securities may be volatile and subject to fluctuations. Some of the factors that could cause fluctuation in the stock price or trading volume of our equity securities include:   ●  general market and economic conditions and market trends, including in the television broadcast industry and the financial markets generally;    ●  the political, economic and social situation in the United States;    ●  actual or anticipated variations in operating results, including audience share ratings and financial results;    ●  inability to meet projections in revenue;    ●  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments or other business developments;    ●  technological innovations in the television broadcast industry;    ●  adoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;    ●  operations of competitors and the performance of competitors’ common stock;    ●  litigation or governmental action involving or affecting us or our subsidiaries;    ●  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;    ●  recruitment or departure of key personnel;    ●  purchases or sales of blocks of our common stock; and    ●  operating and stock performance of the companies that investors may consider to be comparable.  There can be no assurance that the price of our equity securities will not fluctuate or decline significantly. The stock market in recent years has experienced considerable price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies and that could adversely affect the price of our equity securities, regardless of our operating performance. Stock price volatility might be worse if the trading volume of shares of our equity securities is low. Furthermore, stockholders may initiate securities class action lawsuits if the market price of our equity securities were to decline significantly, which may cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management.        24                   We currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and Class A common stock but this is subject to approval by our Board each quarter. To the extent a potential investor ascribes value to a dividend paying stock, the value of our stock may be correspondingly affected.  Our Board of Directors reinstated a cash or stock dividend on both classes of our common stock beginning in the first quarter of 2021. The timing and amount of any future dividend is at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and they may be subject to limitations or restrictions in our Senior Credit Facility and other financing agreements we may be, or become, party to. We can provide no assurance when or if any future dividends will be declared on our common stock or Class A common stock. As a result, if and to the extent an investor ascribes value to a dividend paying stock, the value of our common stock or Class A common stock may be correspondingly affected. Anti-takeover provisions contained in our Restated Articles of Incorporation (“Articles”) and our Bylaws, as amended (“Bylaws”), as well as provisions of Georgia law, could impair a takeover attempt. Our Articles and Bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging a prospective acquirer from making a tender offer for our shares of common stock or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. To the extent that these provisions discourage takeover attempts, they could deprive stockholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares. Moreover, these provisions could discourage accumulations of large blocks of common stock, thus depriving stockholders of any advantages which large accumulations of stock might provide. As a Georgia corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Georgia law, including Section 14-2-1132 of the Georgia Business Corporation Code. Section 14-2-1132 prevents some stockholders holding more than 10% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations unless the business combination was approved in advance by our Board of Directors or results in the stockholder holding more than 90% of our outstanding common stock. Any provision of our Articles, our Bylaws or Georgia law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. We have the ability to issue additional preferred stock, which could affect the rights of holders of our common stock and Class A common stock. Including the shares of preferred stock issued in the Raycom Merger, our Articles allow our Board of Directors to issue up to 20 million shares of preferred stock and set forth the terms of such preferred stock. The terms of any such preferred stock, if issued, may adversely affect the dividend and liquidation rights of holders of our common stock. Holders of our Class A common stock have the right to 10 votes per share on all matters to be voted on by our stockholders and, consequently, the ability to exert significant influence over us. As a result of the 10 to 1 voting rights of holders of our Class A common stock, these stockholders are expected to be able to exert significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including mergers and other material transactions, and may be able to cause or prevent a change in the composition of our Board of Directors or a change in control of our Company that could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.        25                   Certain stockholders or groups of stockholders have the ability to exert significant influence over us. Hilton H. Howell, Jr., our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is the husband of Robin R. Howell, a member of our Board of Directors (collectively with other members of their family, the “Howell-Robinson Family”). As a result of their significant stockholdings and positions on the Board of Directors, the Howell-Robinson Family is able to exert significant influence over our policies and management, potentially in a manner which may not be consistent with the interests of our other stockholders. Risks Related to Regulatory Matters Federal broadcasting industry regulations limit our operating flexibility. The FCC regulates all television broadcasters, including us. We must obtain FCC approval whenever we (i) apply for a new license; (ii) seek to renew, modify or assign a license; (iii) purchase a broadcast station; and/or (iv) transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries that holds a license. Our FCC licenses are critical to our operations, and we cannot operate without them. We cannot be certain that the FCC will renew these licenses in the future or approve new acquisitions, mergers, divestitures or other business activities. Our failure to renew any licenses upon the expiration of any license term could have a material adverse effect on our business. Federal legislation and FCC rules have changed significantly in recent years and may continue to change. These changes may limit our ability to conduct our business in ways that we believe would be advantageous and may affect our operating results. The FCC can sanction us for programming broadcast on our stations that it finds to be indecent. Over the past several years, the FCC has increased its enforcement efforts regarding broadcast indecency and profanity and the statutory maximum fine for broadcasting indecent material is more than $400,000 per incident. In June 2012, the Supreme Court decided a challenge to the FCC’s indecency enforcement policies without resolving the scope of the FCC’s ability to regulate broadcast content. In August 2013, the FCC issued a Public Notice seeking comment on whether it should modify its indecency policies. The FCC has not yet issued a decision in this proceeding and the courts remain free to review the FCC’s current policy or any modifications thereto. The outcomes of these proceedings could affect future FCC policies in this area, and we are unable to predict the outcome of any such judicial proceeding, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The FCC’s duopoly restrictions limit our ability to own and operate multiple television stations in the same market. The FCC’s ownership rules generally prohibit us from owning or having “attributable interests” in two television stations that are located in the same market unless at least one of the stations is not ranked among the top-four stations in the market (the “top-four” prohibition). In November 2017, the FCC released an order that eliminated or relaxed several long-standing media ownership rules, including the requirement that, in addition to compliance with the “top-four” prohibition, common ownership of two stations in a single market was permissible only if eight or more independently-owned television stations would remain in the market (the “eight voices” test). However, in November 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated these rule changes and reinstated the prior, more restrictive, ownership rules, including the “eight voices” test. The Supreme Court of the United States granted the FCC’s petition for certiorari seeking review of the Third Circuit decision; and on April 1, 2021, the Supreme Court reversed the Third Circuit’s decision. As a result of the Supreme Court’s ruling, the FCC’s less restrictive ownership rules became effective on June 30, 2021. In December 2018, the FCC launched a new proceeding to consider whether further changes in the media ownership rules are necessary. The FCC also considers television Local Marketing Agreements (“LMAs”) (which are agreements under which a television station sells or provides more than 15% of the programming on another same-market television station) as “attributable interests.” Pursuant to the FCC’s ownership rules currently in effect, our ability to expand in our present markets through additional station acquisitions or LMAs may be constrained.        26                   The FCC’s National Television Station Ownership Rule limits the maximum number of households we can reach. Under the FCC’s National Television Station Ownership Rule, a single television station owner may not reach more than 39% of United States households through commonly owned television stations, subject to a 50% discount of the number of television households attributable to UHF stations (the “UHF Discount”). In December 2017, the FCC issued an NPRM seeking comment on whether it should modify or eliminate the national cap, including the UHF Discount. This rule may constrain our ability to expand through additional station acquisitions. Currently our station portfolio reaches approximately 36% of total United States television households, or after applying the UHF discount approximately 25% of total United States television households. The Company is subject to governmental oversight regarding compliance with antitrust law as well as related civil litigation. Various governmental agencies, including the DOJ, have authority to enforce the antitrust laws of the United States in the broadcast television industry. The DOJ has increased its enforcement activities within the industry. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2018, the DOJ filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against six broadcasters, including Raycom and Meredith, alleging an agreement to exchange certain competitively sensitive information relating to advertising sales among certain stations in some local markets. The broadcasters and the DOJ entered into substantially identical consent decrees, which, among other things, prohibits the defendant broadcasters from exchanging competitively sensitive information and impose certain compliance requirements. No party to the settlement agreement, including Raycom and Meredith, admitted to any wrongdoing. In addition, following the public disclosure of the DOJ’s investigation and settlement, various putative class action lawsuits were filed against a number of owners of television stations. The cases have been consolidated in a single multidistrict litigation in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and the Plaintiffs’ operative complaint alleges price fixing and unlawful information exchange among the defendants’ advertisement sales teams. We are unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings. For more information on these proceedings, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings.” "
7,GTN,GRAY TELEVISION INC,2021-02-25,"RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information contained in, incorporated by reference into or otherwise referred to in this annual report on Form 10-K, you should consider carefully the following factors when evaluating our business. Any of these risks, or the occurrence of any of the events described in these risk factors, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and the results of operations. In addition, other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently do not deem material could arise, any of which could also materially adversely affect us. This annual report on Form 10-K also contains and incorporates by reference forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the occurrence of one or more of the following risk factors.  RisksRelated to Our Indebtedness We have substantial debt and have the ability to incur significant additional debt. The principal and interest payment obligations on such debt may restrict our future operations and impair our ability to meet our long-term obligations. Currently we have approximately $4.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness, excluding intercompany debt and deferred financing costs. Subject to our ability to meet certain borrowing conditions under our senior credit facility (the “2019 Senior Credit Facility”), we have the ability to incur significant additional debt, including secured debt under our un-drawn $200 million revolving credit facility. The terms of the indenture (the “2030 Notes Indenture”) governing our outstanding 4.750% senior notes due 2030 (the “2030 Notes”), the indenture (the “2027 Notes Indenture”) governing our outstanding 7.0% senior notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”) and the indenture (the “2026 Notes Indenture”) governing our outstanding 5.875% senior notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) also permit us to incur additional indebtedness, subject to our ability to meet certain borrowing conditions.        18                   Our substantial debt may have important consequences. For instance, it could:  ●require us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt, which would reduce funds available for other business purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions;    ●place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors that may have less debt and better access to capital resources;    ●limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes; and    ●make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations. Our ability to service our significant financial obligations depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow. This is partially subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, that future borrowings will be available to us under our 2019 Senior Credit Facility or any other credit facilities, or that we will be able to complete any necessary financings, in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our operations or pay our debts and other obligations, or to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts, at times or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Specifically, volatility in the capital markets may also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, or to refinance our existing debt, on terms or at times favorable to us. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to service our debt or other obligations, which could result in us being in default thereon, in which circumstances our lenders could cease making loans to us, and lenders or other holders of our debt could accelerate and declare due all outstanding obligations due under the respective agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on us. The agreements governing our various debt obligations impose restrictions on our operations and limit our ability to undertake certain corporate actions. The agreements governing our various debt obligations, including our 2019 Senior Credit Facility, the 2030 Notes Indenture, the 2027 Notes Indenture and the 2026 Notes Indenture (together, the “existing indentures” or the “indentures”), include covenants imposing significant restrictions on our operations. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These covenants place, or will place, restrictions on our ability to, among other things:   ●  incur additional debt, subject to certain limitations;    ●  declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders;    ●  make investments or acquisitions;         19                     ●  create liens or use assets as security in other transactions;    ●  issue guarantees;    ●  merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets;    ●  amend our articles of incorporation or bylaws;    ●  engage in transactions with affiliates; and    ●  purchase, sell or transfer certain assets.  Any of these restrictions and limitations could make it more difficult for us to execute our business strategy. The existing indentures and our 2019 Senior Credit Facility require us to comply with certain financial ratios or other covenants; our failure to do so would result in a default thereunder, which would have a material adverse effect on us. We are required to comply with certain financial or other covenants under the existing indentures and our 2019 Senior Credit Facility. Our ability to comply with these requirements may be affected by events affecting our business, but beyond our control, including prevailing general economic, financial and industry conditions. These covenants could have an adverse effect on us by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, investment, acquisition or other corporate opportunities. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the existing indentures or our 2019 Senior Credit Facility. Upon a default under any of our debt agreements, the lenders or debtholders thereunder could have the right to declare all amounts outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable, which could, in turn, trigger defaults under other debt obligations and could result in the termination of commitments of the lenders to make further extensions of credit under our 2019 Senior Credit Facility. If we were unable to repay our secured debt to our lenders, or were otherwise in default under any provision governing our outstanding secured debt obligations, our secured lenders could proceed against us and our subsidiary guarantors and against the collateral securing that debt. Any default resulting in an acceleration of outstanding indebtedness, a termination of commitments under our financing arrangements or lenders proceeding against the collateral securing such indebtedness would likely result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly. Borrowings under our 2019 Senior Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If the rates on which our borrowings are based were to increase from current levels, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available to service our other obligations would decrease.        20                   Risks Related to Our Business Operating Risks The COVID-19 global pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our business. The COVID-19 global pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. We expect the COVID-19 global pandemic to have a material adverse impact on our business including our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on our business, including our ability to execute our near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; the negative impact it has on global and regional economies and economic activity; changes in advertising customers and consumer behavior; impact of governmental regulations that might be imposed in response to the pandemic, its short and longer-term impact on the levels of consumer confidence; actions governments, businesses and individuals take in response to the pandemic; and how quickly economies recover after the COVID-19 global pandemic subsides. Although we have continued to operate our facilities to date and have taken precautions, consistent with federal guidelines and state and local orders, to protect the safety and well-being of our employees, customers and the general public, the COVID-19 global pandemic and any preventive or protective actions taken by governmental authorities have had and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our workforce and operations. In addition, we may become party to lawsuits related to the risk of exposure to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The COVID-19 global pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a widespread and broad reaching effect on the economy and could have adverse impacts on our clients, which has resulted and could continue to result in a decrease in advertising spend and/or heighten the risk with respect to the collectability of our receivables. Additionally, as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic, we have experienced a disruption in creation of content that we broadcast on our television stations and of events and programs we produce at our production companies, including the cancellation of certain sports events and the shutting down of production of certain television content. Consumer spending and changes in advertising generally may also be negatively impacted by general macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence, including the impacts of any recession, resulting from the COVID-19 global pandemic. This may negatively impact revenues. In addition, disruption of global financial markets as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital in the future. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on our business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as information is rapidly evolving with respect to the duration and severity of the pandemic and the resulting effects on local, national and global economies. At this point, we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of the COVID-19 global pandemic, or its overall impact on our business. Even after the COVID-19 global pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future. The effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic may also impact financial markets and corporate credit markets which could adversely impact our access to financing or the terms of any such financing. Any of these events could exacerbate the other risks and uncertainties described herein, or in other reports filed with the SEC from time to time, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price.        21                   The success of our business is dependent upon advertising revenues, which are seasonal and cyclical, and also fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our main source of revenue is the sale of advertising time and space. Our ability to sell advertising time and space depends on, among other things:   ●  economic conditions in the areas where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole;    ●  the popularity of the programming offered by our television stations;    ●  changes in the population demographics in the areas where our stations are located;     ●local and national advertising price fluctuations, which can be affected by the availability of programming, the popularity of programming, and the relative supply of and demand for commercial advertising;    ●our competitors’ activities, including increased competition from other advertising-based mediums, particularly digital platforms, cable networks, MVPDs and other internet companies;    ●the duration and extent of any network preemption of regularly scheduled programming for any reason;   ●  decisions by advertisers to withdraw or delay planned advertising expenditures for any reason;     ●labor disputes or other disruptions at major national advertisers, programming providers or networks; and   ●  other factors beyond our control.  Our results are also subject to seasonal and cyclical fluctuations. Seasonal fluctuations typically result in higher revenue and broadcast operating income in the second and fourth quarters rather than in the first and third quarters of each year. This seasonality is primarily attributable to advertisers’ increased expenditures in the spring and in anticipation of holiday season spending in the fourth quarter and an increase in television viewership during these periods. In addition, we typically experience fluctuations in our revenue and broadcast operating income between even-numbered and odd-numbered years. In years in which there are impending elections for various state and national offices, which primarily occur in even-numbered years, political advertising revenue tends to increase, often significantly, and particularly during presidential election years. We consider political broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned from the sale of advertising to political candidates, political parties and special interest groups of advertisements broadcast by our stations that contain messages primarily focused on elections and/or public policy issues. In even-numbered years, we typically derive a material portion of our broadcast advertising revenue from political broadcast advertisers. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we derived approximately 18% and 3%, respectively, of our total revenue from political broadcast advertisers. If political broadcast advertising revenues declined, especially in an even-numbered year, our results of operations and financial condition could also be materially adversely affected. Also, our stations affiliated with the NBC Network broadcast Olympic Games and typically experience increased viewership and revenue during those broadcasts. As a result of the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenue and broadcast operating income, and the historically significant increase in our revenue and broadcast operating income during even-numbered years, it has been, and is expected to remain, difficult to engage in period-over-period comparisons of our revenue and results of operations.        22                   Continued uncertain financial and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Financial and economic conditions continue to be uncertain over the longer term and the continuation or worsening of such conditions could reduce consumer confidence and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. If consumer confidence were to decline, this decline could negatively affect our advertising customers’ businesses and their advertising budgets. In addition, volatile economic conditions could have a negative impact on our industry or the industries of our customers who advertise on our stations, resulting in reduced advertising sales. Furthermore, it may be possible that actions taken by any governmental or regulatory body for the purpose of stabilizing the economy or financial markets will not achieve their intended effect. In addition to any negative direct consequences to our business or results of operations arising from these financial and economic developments, some of these actions may adversely affect financial institutions, capital providers, advertisers or other consumers on whom we rely, including for access to future capital or financing arrangements necessary to support our business. Our inability to obtain financing in amounts and at times necessary could make it more difficult or impossible to meet our obligations or otherwise take actions in our best interests. Our dependence upon a limited number of advertising categories could adversely affect our business. We consider broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned primarily from the sale of advertisements broadcast by our stations. Although no single customer represented more than 5% of our broadcast advertising revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019, we derived a material portion of non-political broadcast advertising revenue from advertisers in a limited number of industries, particularly the automotive industry. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 we derived approximately 21% and 25%, respectively, of our total broadcast advertising revenue from our advertisers in the automotive industry. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if broadcast advertising revenue from the automotive, or certain other industries, such as the medical, restaurant, communications, or furniture and appliances industries, declined. We intend to continue to evaluate growth opportunities through strategic acquisitions, and there are significant risks associated with an acquisition strategy. We intend to continue to evaluate opportunities for growth through selective acquisitions of television stations or station groups. There can be no assurances that we will be able to identify any suitable acquisition candidates, and we cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing or completing any acquisitions, or what the consequences of not completing any acquisitions would be. Consummation of any proposed acquisition at any time may also be subject to various conditions such as compliance with FCC rules and policies. Consummation of acquisitions may also be subject to antitrust or other regulatory requirements. In addition, as we operate in a highly regulated industry, we could be subject to litigation, government investigations and enforcement actions on a variety of matters, the result of which could limit our acquisition strategy. An acquisition strategy involves numerous other risks, including risks associated with:  ●identifying suitable acquisition candidates and negotiating definitive purchase agreements on satisfactory terms;    ●integrating operations and systems and managing a large and geographically diverse group of stations;        23                     ●  obtaining financing to complete acquisitions, which financing may not be available to us at times, in amounts, or at rates acceptable to us, if at all, and potentially the related risks associated with increased debt;    ●  diverting our management’s attention from other business concerns;    ●  potentially losing key employees; and    ●  potential changes in the regulatory approval process that may make it materially more expensive, or materially delay our ability, to consummate any proposed acquisitions.  Our failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates, or to complete any acquisitions and integrate any acquired business, or to obtain the expected benefits therefrom, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may fail to realize any benefits and incur unanticipated losses related to any acquisition. The success of any strategic acquisition depends, in part, on our ability to successfully combine the acquired business and assets with our business and our ability to successfully manage the assets so acquired. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition. Successful integration may also be hampered by any differences between the operations and corporate culture of the two organizations. Additionally, general market and economic conditions may inhibit our successful integration of any business. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of an acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Finally, any cost savings that are realized may be offset by losses in revenues from the acquired business, any assets or operations disposed of in connection therewith or otherwise, or charges to earnings in connection with such acquisitions. We must purchase television programming in advance of knowing whether a particular show will be popular enough for us to recoup our costs. One of our most significant costs is for the purchase of television programming. If a particular program is not sufficiently popular among audiences in relation to the cost we pay for such program, we may not be able to sell enough related advertising time for us to recover the costs we pay to broadcast the program. We are frequently required to purchase programming several years in advance, and we may have to commit to purchase more than one year’s worth of programming, resulting in the incurrence of significant costs in advance of our receipt of any related revenue. We may also replace programs that are performing poorly before we have recaptured any significant portion of the costs we incurred in obtaining such programming or fully expensed the costs for financial reporting purposes. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues, result in the incurrence of impairment charges or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues. We are highly dependent upon our network affiliations, and our business and results of operations may be materially affected if a network: (i) terminates its affiliation with us; (ii) significantly changes the economic terms and conditions of any future affiliation agreements with us or; (iii) significantly changes the type, quality or quantity of programming provided to us under an affiliation agreement. Our business depends in large part on the success of our network affiliations. Nearly all of our stations are directly or indirectly affiliated with at least one of the four major broadcast networks pursuant to a separate affiliation agreement. Each affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the affiliated network during the term of the related agreement. Our affiliation agreements generally expire at various dates through December 2023.        24                   If we cannot enter into affiliation agreements to replace any agreements in advance of their expiration, we would no longer be able to carry the affiliated network’s programming. This loss of programming would require us to seek to obtain replacement programming. Such replacement programming may involve higher costs and may not be as attractive to our target audiences, thereby reducing our ability to generate advertising revenue. Furthermore, our concentration of CBS and/or NBC affiliates makes us particularly sensitive to adverse changes in our business relationship with, and the general success of, CBS and/or NBC. We can give no assurance that any future affiliation agreements will have economic terms or conditions equivalent to or more advantageous to us than our current agreements. If in the future a network or networks impose more adverse economic terms upon us, such event or events could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, if we are unable to renew or replace any existing affiliation agreements, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations under our existing or any future retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs and/or secure payment of retransmission consent fees under such agreements. Furthermore, if in the future a network limited or removed our ability to retransmit network programming to MVPDs, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations or criteria for fees under any existing or any future retransmission consent agreements. In either case, such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are also dependent upon our retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs, and we cannot predict the outcome of potential regulatory changes to the retransmission consent regime. We are also dependent, in significant part, on our retransmission consent agreements. Our current retransmission consent agreements expire at various times over the next several years. No assurances can be provided that we will be able to renegotiate all of such agreements on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. The failure to renegotiate such agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our ability to successfully negotiate future retransmission consent agreements may be hindered by potential legislative or regulatory charges to the framework under which these agreements are negotiated. The FCC has taken actions to implement various provisions of STELAR affecting the carriage of television stations, including (i) adopting rules that allow for the modification of satellite television markets in order to ensure that satellite operators carry the broadcast stations of most interest to their communities; (ii) tightening its rules on joint retransmission consent negotiations to prohibit joint negotiations by stations in the same market unless those stations are commonly controlled; (iii) prohibiting a television station from limiting the ability of an MVPD to carry into its local market television signals that are deemed significantly viewed; and (iv) eliminating the “sweeps prohibition,” which had precluded cable operators from deleting or repositioning local commercial television stations during “sweeps” ratings periods. We currently are not a party to any agreements that delegate our authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any of our television stations or grant us authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any other television station. Nevertheless, we cannot predict how the FCC’s restrictions on joint negotiations might impact future opportunities.        25                   The FCC also has sought comment on whether it should modify or eliminate the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. If, however, the FCC eliminates or relaxes its rules enforcing our program exclusivity rights, it could affect our ability to negotiate future retransmission consent agreements, and it could harm our ratings and advertising revenue if cable and satellite operators import duplicative programming. In addition, certain OVDs have explored streaming broadcast programming over the internet without approval from or payments to the broadcaster. The majority of federal courts have issued preliminary injunctions enjoining these OVDs from streaming broadcast programming. Recently, a new OVD, organized as a non-profit began operating, claiming that its operations are exempt from copyright liability because of its non-profit status. In July 2019, the major broadcast networks and certain affiliated entities filed a copyright lawsuit against this OVD. The OVD continues to operate while the lawsuit is pending. We cannot predict the outcome of this lawsuit. Separately, on December 19, 2014, the FCC issued an NPRM proposing to classify certain OVDs as MVPDs for purposes of certain FCC carriage rules. If the FCC adopts its proposal, OVDs would need to negotiate for consent from broadcasters before they retransmit broadcast signals. We cannot predict whether the FCC will adopt its proposal or other modified rules that might weaken our rights to negotiate with OVDs. In December 2019, Congress adopted the Satellite Television Community Protection and Promotion Act of 2019 and the TVPA of 2019. Among other things, these acts (i) made permanent the copyright license set out in Section 119 of the Copyright Act; (ii) limited eligibility for use of the Section 119 license to retransmit the signals of network television broadcast stations to unserved households to those satellite operators who provide local-into-local service to all DMAs; and (iii) modified the definition of unserved households to those households located in a “short market” (which, in turn, was defined as a local market in which programming of one or more of the top four networks is not offered on either the primary or multicast stream by any network station in that market). The TVPA of 2019 also made permanent the requirement that broadcasters and MVPDs negotiate in good faith and adds a provision that will (i) allow MVPDs to designate a buying group to negotiate retransmission consent agreements on their behalf and (ii) require large stations groups, including ours, to negotiate in good faith with a qualified MVPD buying group. Congress continues to consider various changes to the statutory scheme governing retransmission of broadcast programming. Some of the proposed bills would make it more difficult to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with large MVPDs and would weaken our leverage to seek market-based compensation for our programming. We cannot predict whether any of these proposals will become law, and, if any do, we cannot determine the effect that any statutory changes would have on our business. We may be unable to maintain or increase our digital advertising revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. We generate a portion of our advertising revenue from the sale of advertisements on our digital sites. Our ability to maintain and increase this advertising revenue is largely dependent upon the number of users actively visiting our internet sites and using our digital apps. As a result, we must increase user engagement with our internet sites in order to increase our advertising revenue. Because digital advertising techniques are evolving, if our content, technology and advertisement serving techniques do not evolve to meet the changing needs of advertisers, our advertising revenue could also decline. Changes in our business model, advertising inventory or initiatives could also cause a decrease in our internet advertising revenue. We do not have long-term agreements with most of our digital advertisers. Any termination, change or decrease in our relationships with our largest digital advertising clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. If we do not maintain or increase our digital advertising revenue, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.        26                   Cybersecurity risks could affect our operating effectiveness. We use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. Our revenues are increasingly dependent on digital products. Such use exposes us to potential cyber incidents resulting from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents could include, but are not limited to, unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, data corruption or operational disruption. The results of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, business interruption, disclosure of nonpublic information, decreased advertising revenues, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation, financial consequences and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence, any or all of which could adversely affect our business. Although we have systems and processes in place to protect against risks associated with cyber incidents, depending on the nature of an incident, these protections may not be fully sufficient. Industry Risks We operate in a highly competitive environment. Competition occurs on multiple levels (for audiences, programming and advertisers) and is based on a variety of factors. If we are not able to successfully compete in all relevant aspects, our revenues will be materially adversely affected. Television stations compete for audiences, certain programming (including news) and advertisers. Signal coverage and carriage on MVPD systems also materially affect a television station’s competitive position. With respect to audiences, stations compete primarily based on broadcast program popularity. We cannot provide any assurances as to the acceptability by audiences of any of the programs we broadcast. Further, because we compete with other broadcast stations for certain programming, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain any desired programming at costs that we believe are reasonable. Cable-network programming, combined with increased access to cable, satellite TV, and internet video streaming services, has become a significant competitor for broadcast television programming viewers. Cable networks’ viewership and advertising share have increased due to the growth in MVPD and internet video streaming services, penetration (the percentage of television households that are connected to an MVPD or internet video system) and increased investments in programming by cable networks or internet video. Further increases in the advertising share of cable networks and internet video streaming services could materially adversely affect the advertising revenue of our television stations. In addition, technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of programming alternatives, such as internet websites, mobile apps and wireless carriers, direct-to-consumer video distribution systems, and home entertainment systems have further fractionalized television viewing audiences and resulted in additional challenges to revenue generation. New technologies and methods of buying advertising also present an additional competitive challenge, as competitors may offer products and services such as the ability to purchase advertising programmatically or bundled offline and online advertising, aimed at more efficiently capturing advertising spend. Our inability or failure to broadcast popular programs, or otherwise maintain viewership for any reason, including as a result of increases in programming alternatives, or our loss of advertising due to technological changes, could result in a lack of advertisers, or a reduction in the amount advertisers are willing to pay us to advertise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.        27                   Other Financial Risks We have, in the past, incurred impairment charges on our goodwill and/or broadcast licenses, and any such future charges may have a material effect on the value of our total assets. As of December 31, 2020, the book value of our broadcast licenses was $3.6 billion and the book value of our goodwill was $1.5 billion, in comparison to total assets of $7.6 billion. Not less than annually, and more frequently if necessary, we are required to evaluate our goodwill and broadcast licenses to determine if the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value. If the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value, we will be required to record a non-cash expense to write down the book value of the intangible asset to the estimated fair value. We cannot make any assurances that any required impairment charges will not have a material adverse effect on our total assets. Recently enacted changes to the United States tax laws may have a material impact on our business or financial condition. On December 22, 2017, United States tax reform legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) was signed into law. The TCJA made substantial changes to United States tax law, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate, a limitation on deductibility of interest expense, a limitation on the use of net operating losses to offset future taxable income and the allowance of immediate expensing of capital expenditures. The TCJA will continue to have significant effects on us, some of which may be adverse. The extent of the impact remains uncertain at this time and is subject to any other regulatory or administrative developments, including any further regulations or other guidance yet to be promulgated by the United States Internal Revenue Service. The TCJA contains numerous, complex provisions that could affect us. We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations and we depend on our subsidiaries for cash. We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations, other than our investments in our subsidiaries. Because we are a holding company, we are dependent upon the payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. These payments could be or become subject to dividend or other restrictions under applicable laws in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. Payments by our subsidiaries are also contingent upon the subsidiaries’ earnings. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our financial condition and ability to meet our obligations may be adversely affected. Our defined benefit pension plan obligation is currently underfunded, and, if certain factors worsen, we may have to make significant cash payments, which could reduce the cash available for our business. We have underfunded obligations under our defined benefit pension plan. Notwithstanding that our pension plan is frozen with regard to any future benefit accruals, the funded status of our pension plan is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of certain market interest rates and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations. Unfavorable returns on the plan’s assets or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations may materially change the timing and amount of required plan funding, which could reduce the cash available for our business. In addition, any future decreases in the discount rate used to determine pension obligations could result in an increase in the valuation of pension obligations, which could affect the reported funding status of our pension plan and future contributions.        28                   Risks Related to Regulatory Matters Federal broadcasting industry regulations limit our operating flexibility. The FCC regulates all television broadcasters, including us. We must obtain FCC approval whenever we (i) apply for a new license; (ii) seek to renew, modify or assign a license; (iii) purchase a broadcast station; and/or (iv) transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries that holds a license. Our FCC licenses are critical to our operations, and we cannot operate without them. We cannot be certain that the FCC will renew these licenses in the future or approve new acquisitions, mergers, divestitures or other business activities. Our failure to renew any licenses upon the expiration of any license term could have a material adverse effect on our business. Federal legislation and FCC rules have changed significantly in recent years and may continue to change. These changes may limit our ability to conduct our business in ways that we believe would be advantageous and may affect our operating results. The FCC can sanction us for programming broadcast on our stations that it finds to be indecent. Over the past several years, the FCC has increased its enforcement efforts regarding broadcast indecency and profanity and the statutory maximum fine for broadcasting indecent material is currently $414,454 per incident. In June 2012, the Supreme Court decided a challenge to the FCC’s indecency enforcement policies without resolving the scope of the FCC’s ability to regulate broadcast content. In August 2013, the FCC issued a Public Notice seeking comment on whether it should modify its indecency policies. The FCC has not yet issued a decision in this proceeding and the courts remain free to review the FCC’s current policy or any modifications thereto. The outcomes of these proceedings could affect future FCC policies in this area, and we are unable to predict the outcome of any such judicial proceeding, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The FCC’s duopoly restrictions limit our ability to own and operate multiple television stations in the same market. The FCC’s ownership rules generally prohibit us from owning or having “attributable interests” in two television stations that are located in the same market when one of the stations is ranked among the top-four stations in the market unless eight independently owned, full-power stations will remain in the market. In November 2017, the FCC released an order that eliminated or relaxed several long-standing media ownership rules. However, in November 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated these rule changes and reinstated the prior, more restrictive, ownership rules. The Supreme Court of the United States granted the FCC’s petition for certiorari seeking review of the Third Circuit decision. The case was argued before the Supreme Court on January 19, 2021. In December 2018, the FCC launched a new proceeding to consider whether further changes in the media ownership rules were necessary. The FCC also considers television Local Marketing Agreements (“LMAs”) (which are agreements under which a television station sells or provides more than 15% of the programming on another same-market television station) as “attributable interests.” With the previous ownership rules in effect, our ability to expand in our present markets through additional station acquisitions or LMAs may be constrained. The FCC’s National Television Station Ownership Rule limits the maximum number of households we can reach. Under the FCC’s National Television Station Ownership Rule, a single television station owner may not reach more than 39% of United States households through commonly owned television stations, subject to a 50% discount of the number of television households attributable to UHF stations (the “UHF Discount”). In December 2017, the FCC issued an NPRM seeking comment on whether it should modify or eliminate the national cap, including the UHF Discount. This rule may constrain our ability to expand through additional station acquisitions. Currently our station portfolio reaches approximately 24% of total United States television households, or approximately 17% of total United States television households, after applying the UHF discount.        29                   The Company is subject to governmental oversight regarding compliance with antitrust law as well as related civil litigation. Various governmental agencies, including the DOJ, have authority to enforce the antitrust laws of the United States in the broadcast television industry. The DOJ has increased its enforcement activities within the industry. For example, in November 2018, the DOJ filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against six broadcasters, including Raycom, alleging an agreement to exchange competitively sensitive information. The broadcasters and the DOJ entered into a settlement agreement, which, among other things, prohibits the defendant broadcasters from exchanging competitively sensitive information and impose certain compliance requirements. No party to the settlement agreement, including Raycom, admitted to any wrongdoing. In addition, following the public disclosure of the DOJ’s investigation, several putative class action lawsuits were filed against various broadcasters, including Gray, asserting claims related to those reflected in the DOJ settlement. These lawsuits have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois for the purpose of coordinated and consolidated pretrial proceedings. We are unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings. Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Equity Securities The price and trading volume of our equity securities may be volatile. The price and trading volume of our equity securities may be volatile and subject to fluctuations. Some of the factors that could cause fluctuation in the stock price or trading volume of our equity securities include:   ●  general market and economic conditions and market trends, including in the television broadcast industry and the financial markets generally;    ●  the political, economic and social situation in the United States;    ●  actual or anticipated variations in operating results, including audience share ratings and financial results;    ●  inability to meet projections in revenue;    ●  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments or other business developments;    ●  technological innovations in the television broadcast industry;    ●  adoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;    ●  operations of competitors and the performance of competitors’ common stock;    ●  litigation or governmental action involving or affecting us or our subsidiaries;    ●  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;    ●  recruitment or departure of key personnel;    ●  purchases or sales of blocks of our common stock; and    ●  operating and stock performance of the companies that investors may consider to be comparable.         30                   There can be no assurance that the price of our equity securities will not fluctuate or decline significantly. The stock market in recent years has experienced considerable price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies and that could adversely affect the price of our equity securities, regardless of our operating performance. Stock price volatility might be worse if the trading volume of shares of our equity securities is low. Furthermore, stockholders may initiate securities class action lawsuits if the market price of our equity securities were to decline significantly, which may cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management. We do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock or Class A common stock. To the extent a potential investor ascribes value to a dividend paying stock, the value of our stock may be correspondingly reduced.  Our Board of Directors has not declared a cash or stock dividend on either class of our common stock since 2008. The timing and amount of any future dividend is at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and they may be subject to limitations or restrictions in our 2019 Senior Credit Facility and other financing agreements we may be, or become, party to. We can provide no assurance when or if any future dividends will be declared on our common stock or Class A common stock. As a result, if and to the extent an investor ascribes value to a dividend paying stock, the value of our common stock or Class A common stock may be correspondingly reduced. Anti-takeover provisions contained in our Restated Articles of Incorporation (“Articles”) and our Bylaws, as amended (“Bylaws”), as well as provisions of Georgia law, could impair a takeover attempt. Our Articles and Bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging a prospective acquirer from making a tender offer for our shares of common stock or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. To the extent that these provisions discourage takeover attempts, they could deprive stockholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares. Moreover, these provisions could discourage accumulations of large blocks of common stock, thus depriving stockholders of any advantages which large accumulations of stock might provide. As a Georgia corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Georgia law, including Section 14-2-1132 of the Georgia Business Corporation Code. Section 14-2-1132 prevents some stockholders holding more than 10% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations unless the business combination was approved in advance by our Board of Directors or results in the stockholder holding more than 90% of our outstanding common stock. Any provision of our Articles, our Bylaws or Georgia law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. We have the ability to issue additional preferred stock, which could affect the rights of holders of our common stock and Class A common stock. Including the shares of preferred stock issued in the Raycom Merger, our Articles allow our Board of Directors to issue up to 20 million shares of preferred stock and set forth the terms of such preferred stock. The terms of any such preferred stock, if issued, may adversely affect the dividend and liquidation rights of holders of our common stock.        31                   Holders of our Class A common stock have the right to 10 votes per share on all matters to be voted on by our stockholders and, consequently, the ability to exert significant influence over us. As a result of the 10 to 1 voting rights of holders of our Class A common stock, these stockholders are expected to be able to exert significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including mergers and other material transactions, and may be able to cause or prevent a change in the composition of our Board of Directors or a change in control of our Company that could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock. Certain stockholders or groups of stockholders have the ability to exert significant influence over us. Hilton H. Howell, Jr., our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is the husband of Robin R. Howell, a member of our Board of Directors (collectively with other members of their family, the “Howell-Robinson Family”). As a result of their significant stockholdings and positions on the Board of Directors, the Howell-Robinson Family is able to exert significant influence over our policies and management, potentially in a manner which may not be consistent with the interests of our other stockholders. "
5,GTN,GRAY TELEVISION INC,2020-02-27,"Risk Factors
.  In addition to the other information contained in, incorporated by reference into or otherwise referred to in this annual report on Form 10-K, you should consider carefully the following factors when evaluating our business. Any of these risks, or the occurrence of any of the events described in these risk factors, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently do not deem material could arise, any of which could also materially adversely affect us. This annual report on Form 10-K also contains and incorporates by reference forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the occurrence of one or more of the following risk factors.  RisksRelatedtoOurIndebtedness We have substantial debt and have the ability to incur significant additional debt. The principal and interest payment obligations on such debt may restrict our future operations and impair our ability to meet our long-term obligations. Currently we have approximately $3.8 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness, excluding intercompany debt and deferred financing costs. Subject to our ability to meet certain borrowing conditions under our senior credit facility (the “2019 Senior Credit Facility”), we have the ability to incur significant additional debt, including secured debt under our un-drawn $200 million revolving credit facility. The terms of the indenture (the “2027 Notes Indenture”) governing our outstanding 7.0% senior notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”), the indenture (the “2026 Notes Indenture”) governing our outstanding 5.875% senior notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) and the indenture (the “2024 Notes Indenture”) governing our 5.125% senior notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) also permit us to incur additional indebtedness, subject to our ability to meet certain borrowing conditions. Our substantial debt may have important consequences. For instance, it could:   ●  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt, which would reduce funds available for other business purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions;       17               ●  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors that may have less debt and better access to capital resources;    ●  limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes; and    ●  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations.  Our ability to service our significant financial obligations depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow. This is partially subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, that future borrowings will be available to us under our 2019 Senior Credit Facility or any other credit facilities, or that we will be able to complete any necessary financings, in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our operations or pay our debts and other obligations, or to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts, at times or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Specifically, volatility in the capital markets may also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, or to refinance our existing debt, on terms or at times favorable to us. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to service our debt or other obligations, which could result in us being in default thereon, in which circumstances our lenders could cease making loans to us, and lenders or other holders of our debt could accelerate and declare due all outstanding obligations due under the respective agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on us. The agreements governing our various debt obligations impose restrictions on our operations and limit our ability to undertake certain corporate actions. The agreements governing our various debt obligations, including our 2019 Senior Credit Facility, the 2027 Notes Indenture, the 2026 Notes Indenture and the 2024 Notes Indenture (together, the “existing indentures” or the “indentures”), include covenants imposing significant restrictions on our operations. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These covenants place, or will place, restrictions on our ability to, among other things:   ●  incur additional debt, subject to certain limitations;    ●  declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders;    ●  make investments or acquisitions;    ●  create liens or use assets as security in other transactions;    ●  issue guarantees;    ●  merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets;    ●  amend our articles of incorporation or bylaws;    ●  engage in transactions with affiliates; and       18               ●  purchase, sell or transfer certain assets.  Any of these restrictions and limitations could make it more difficult for us to execute our business strategy. The existing indentures and our 2019 Senior Credit Facility requires us to comply with certain financial ratios or other covenants; our failure to do so would result in a default thereunder, which would have a material adverse effect on us. We are required to comply with certain financial or other covenants under the existing indentures and our 2019 Senior Credit Facility. Our ability to comply with these requirements may be affected by events affecting our business, but beyond our control, including prevailing general economic, financial and industry conditions. These covenants could have an adverse effect on us by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, investment, acquisition or other corporate opportunities. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the existing indentures or our 2019 Senior Credit Facility. Upon a default under any of our debt agreements, the lenders or debtholders thereunder could have the right to declare all amounts outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable, which could, in turn, trigger defaults under other debt obligations and could result in the termination of commitments of the lenders to make further extensions of credit under our 2019 Senior Credit Facility. If we were unable to repay our secured debt to our lenders, or were otherwise in default under any provision governing our outstanding secured debt obligations, our secured lenders could proceed against us and our subsidiary guarantors and against the collateral securing that debt. Any default resulting in an acceleration of outstanding indebtedness, a termination of commitments under our financing arrangements or lenders proceeding against the collateral securing such indebtedness would likely result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly. Borrowings under our 2019 Senior Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If the rates on which our borrowings are based were to increase from current levels, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available to service our other obligations would decrease. RisksRelatedtoOurBusiness The success of our business is dependent upon advertising revenues, which are seasonal and cyclical, and also fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our main source of revenue is the sale of advertising time and space. Our ability to sell advertising time and space depends on, among other things:   ●  economic conditions in the areas where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole;    ●  the popularity of the programming offered by our television stations;    ●  changes in the population demographics in the areas where our stations are located;       19               ●  local and national advertising price fluctuations, which can be affected by the availability of programming, the popularity of programming, and the relative supply of and demand for commercial advertising;    ●  our competitors’ activities, including increased competition from other advertising-based mediums, particularly digital platforms, cable networks, MVPDs and other internet companies;    ●  the duration and extent of any network preemption of regularly scheduled programming for any reason;    ●  decisions by advertisers to withdraw or delay planned advertising expenditures for any reason;   ●labor disputes or other disruptions at major national advertisers, programming providers or networks; and   ●  other factors beyond our control.  Our results are also subject to seasonal and cyclical fluctuations. Seasonal fluctuations typically result in higher revenue and broadcast operating income in the second and fourth quarters rather than in the first and third quarters of each year. This seasonality is primarily attributable to advertisers’ increased expenditures in the spring and in anticipation of holiday season spending in the fourth quarter and an increase in television viewership during this period. In addition, we typically experience fluctuations in our revenue and broadcast operating income between even-numbered and odd- numbered years. In years in which there are impending elections for various state and national offices, which primarily occur in even-numbered years, political advertising revenue tends to increase, often significantly, and particularly during presidential election years. We consider political broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned from the sale of advertising to political candidates, political parties and special interest groups of advertisements broadcast by our stations that contain messages primarily focused on elections and/or public policy issues. In even-numbered years, we typically derive a material portion of our broadcast advertising revenue from political broadcast advertisers. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we derived approximately 3% and 14%, respectively, of our total revenue from political broadcast advertisers. If political broadcast advertising revenues declined, especially in an even-numbered year, our results of operations and financial condition could also be materially adversely affected. Also, our stations affiliated with the NBC Network broadcast Olympic Games and typically experience increased viewership and revenue during those broadcasts, which also occur in even-numbered years. As a result of the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenue and broadcast operating income, and the historically significant increase in our revenue and broadcast operating income during even-numbered years, it has been, and is expected to remain, difficult to engage in period-over-period comparisons of our revenue and results of operations. Continued uncertain financial and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Financial and economic conditions continue to be uncertain over the longer term and the continuation or worsening of such conditions could reduce consumer confidence and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. If consumer confidence were to decline, this decline could negatively affect our advertising customers’ businesses and their advertising budgets. In addition, volatile economic conditions could have a negative impact on our industry or the industries of our customers who advertise on our stations, resulting in reduced advertising sales. Furthermore, it may be possible that actions taken by any governmental or regulatory body for the purpose of stabilizing the economy or financial markets will not achieve their intended effect. In addition to any negative direct consequences to our business or results of operations arising from these financial and economic developments, some of these actions may adversely affect financial institutions, capital providers, advertisers or other consumers on whom we rely, including for access to future capital or financing arrangements necessary to support our business. Our inability to obtain financing in amounts and at times necessary could make it more difficult or impossible to meet our obligations or otherwise take actions in our best interests.      20             Our dependence upon a limited number of advertising categories could adversely affect our business. We consider broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned primarily from the sale of advertisements broadcast by our stations. Although no single customer represented more than 5% of our broadcast advertising revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018, we derived a material portion of non-political broadcast advertising revenue from advertisers in a limited number of industries, particularly the automotive industry. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 we derived approximately 25% of our total broadcast advertising revenue from our advertisers in the automotive industry. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if broadcast advertising revenue from the automotive, or certain other industries, such as the medical, restaurant, communications, or furniture and appliances industries, declined. We intend to continue to evaluate growth opportunities through strategic acquisitions, and there are significant risks associated with an acquisition strategy. We intend to continue to evaluate opportunities for growth through selective acquisitions of television stations or station groups. There can be no assurances that we will be able to identify any suitable acquisition candidates, and we cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing or completing any acquisitions, or what the consequences of not completing any acquisitions would be. Consummation of any proposed acquisition at any time may also be subject to various conditions such as compliance with FCC rules and policies. Consummation of acquisitions may also be subject to antitrust or other regulatory requirements. In addition, as we operate in a highly regulated industry, we could be subject to litigation, government investigations and enforcement actions on a variety of matters, the result of which could limit our acquisition strategy. An acquisition strategy involves numerous other risks, including risks associated with:   ●  identifying suitable acquisition candidates and negotiating definitive purchase agreements on satisfactory terms;    ●  integrating operations and systems and managing a large and geographically diverse group of stations;    ●  obtaining financing to complete acquisitions, which financing may not be available to us at times, in amounts, or at rates acceptable to us, if at all, and potentially the related risks associated with increased debt;    ●  diverting our management’s attention from other business concerns;    ●  potentially losing key employees; and    ●  potential changes in the regulatory approval process that may make it materially more expensive, or materially delay our ability, to consummate any proposed acquisitions.  Our failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates, or to complete any acquisitions and integrate any acquired business, or to obtain the expected benefits therefrom, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.      21             We may fail to realize any benefits and incur unanticipated losses related to any acquisition. The success of any strategic acquisition depends, in part, on our ability to successfully combine the acquired business and assets with our business and our ability to successfully manage the assets so acquired. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition. Successful integration may also be hampered by any differences between the operations and corporate culture of the two organizations. Additionally, general market and economic conditions may inhibit our successful integration of any business. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of an acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Finally, any cost savings that are realized may be offset by losses in revenues from the acquired business, any assets or operations disposed of in connection therewith or otherwise, or charges to earnings in connection with such acquisitions. We must purchase television programming in advance of knowing whether a particular show will be popular enough for us to recoup our costs. One of our most significant costs is for the purchase of television programming. If a particular program is not sufficiently popular among audiences in relation to the cost we pay for such program, we may not be able to sell enough related advertising time for us to recover the costs we pay to broadcast the program. We also must usually purchase programming several years in advance, and we may have to commit to purchase more than one year’s worth of programming, resulting in the incurrence of significant costs in advance of our receipt of any related revenue. We may also replace programs that are performing poorly before we have recaptured any significant portion of the costs we incurred in obtaining such programming or fully expensed the costs for financial reporting purposes. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues, result in the incurrence of impairment charges or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues. We are highly dependent upon our network affiliations, and our business and results of operations may be materially affected if a network (i) terminates its affiliation with us, (ii) significantly changes the economic terms and conditions of any future affiliation agreements with us or (iii) significantly changes the type, quality or quantity of programming provided to us under an affiliation agreement. Our business depends in large part on the success of our network affiliations. Nearly all of our stations are directly or indirectly affiliated with at least one of the four major broadcast networks pursuant to a separate affiliation agreement. Each affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the affiliated network during the term of the related agreement. Our affiliation agreements generally expire at various dates through December 2023. If we cannot enter into affiliation agreements to replace any agreements in advance of their expiration, we would no longer be able to carry the affiliated network’s programming. This loss of programming would require us to seek to obtain replacement programming. Such replacement programming may involve higher costs and may not be as attractive to our target audiences, thereby reducing our ability to generate advertising revenue. Furthermore, our concentration of CBS and/or NBC affiliates makes us particularly sensitive to adverse changes in our business relationship with, and the general success of, CBS and/or NBC. We can give no assurance that any future affiliation agreements will have economic terms or conditions equivalent to or more advantageous to us than our current agreements. If in the future a network or networks impose more adverse economic terms upon us, such event or events could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.      22             In addition, if we are unable to renew or replace any existing affiliation agreements, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations under our existing or any future retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs and/or secure payment of retransmission consent fees under such agreements. Furthermore, if in the future a network limited or removed our ability to retransmit network programming to MVPDs, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations or criteria for fees under any existing or any future retransmission consent agreements. In either case, such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are also dependent upon our retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs, and we cannot predict the outcome of potential regulatory changes to the retransmission consent regime. We are also dependent, in significant part, on our retransmission consent agreements. Our current retransmission consent agreements expire at various times over the next several years. No assurances can be provided that we will be able to renegotiate all of such agreements on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. The failure to renegotiate such agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our ability to successfully negotiate future retransmission consent agreements may be hindered by potential legislative or regulatory charges to the framework under which these agreements are negotiated. The FCC has taken  actions to implement various provisions of STELAR affecting the carriage of television stations, including (i) adopting rules that allow for the modification of satellite television markets in order to ensure that satellite operators carry the broadcast stations of most interest to their communities, (ii) tightening its rules on joint retransmission consent negotiations to prohibit joint negotiations by stations in the same market unless those stations are commonly controlled, (iii) prohibiting a television station from limiting the ability of an MVPD to carry into its local market television signals that are deemed significantly viewed; and (iv) eliminating the “sweeps prohibition,” which had precluded cable operators from deleting or repositioning local commercial television stations during “sweeps” ratings periods. We currently are not a party to any agreements that delegate our authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any of our television stations or grant us authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any other television station. Nevertheless, we cannot predict how the FCC’s restrictions on joint negotiations might impact future opportunities. The FCC also has sought comment on whether it should modify or eliminate the network non- duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. If, however, the FCC eliminates or relaxes its rules enforcing our program exclusivity rights, it could affect our ability to negotiate future retransmission consent agreements, and it could harm our ratings and advertising revenue if cable and satellite operators import duplicative programming. In addition, certain online video distributors (“OVDs”) have explored streaming broadcast programming over the internet without approval from or payments to the broadcaster. The majority of federal courts have issued preliminary injunctions enjoining these OVDs from streaming broadcast programming. Recently, a new OVD, organized as a non- profit began operating, claiming that its operations are exempt from copyright liability because of its non- profit status.  In July 2019, the major broadcast networks and certain affiliated entities filed a copyright lawsuit against this OVD.  The OVD continues to operate while the lawsuit is pending.  We cannot predict the outcome of this lawsuit. Separately, on December 19, 2014, the FCC issued an NPRM proposing to classify certain OVDs as MVPDs for purposes of certain FCC carriage rules. If the FCC adopts its proposal, OVDs would need to negotiate for consent from broadcasters before they retransmit broadcast signals. We cannot predict whether the FCC will adopt its proposal or other modified rules that might weaken our rights to negotiate with OVDs.      23             In December 2019, Congress adopted the Satellite Television Community Protection and Promotion Act of 2019 and the Television Viewer Protection Act of 2019 (the “TVPA of 2019”). Among other things, these acts (i) made permanent the copyright license set out in Section 119 of the Copyright Act; (ii) limited eligibility for use of the Section 119 license to retransmit the signals of network television broadcast stations to unserved households to those satellite operators who provide local-into-local service to all DMAs; and (iii) modified the definition of unserved households to those households located in a “short market” (which, in turn, was defined as a local market in which programming of one or more of the top four networks is not offered on either the primary or multicast stream by any network station in that market).  The TVPA of 2019 also made permanent the requirement that broadcasters and MVPDs negotiate in good faith and adds a provision that will (i) allow MVPDs to designate a buying group to negotiate retransmission consent agreements on their behalf and (ii) require large stations groups, including ours, to negotiate in good faith with a qualified MVPD buying group. Congress continues to consider various changes to the statutory scheme governing retransmission of broadcast programming. Some of the proposed bills would make it more difficult to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with large MVPDs and would weaken our leverage to seek market-based compensation for our programming. We cannot predict whether any of these proposals will become law, and, if any do, we cannot determine the effect that any statutory changes would have on our business. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Competition occurs on multiple levels (for audiences, programming and advertisers) and is based on a variety of factors. If we are not able to successfully compete in all relevant aspects, our revenues will be materially adversely affected. Television stations compete for audiences, certain programming (including news) and advertisers. Signal coverage and carriage on MVPD systems also materially affect a television station’s competitive position. With respect to audiences, stations compete primarily based on broadcast program popularity. We cannot provide any assurances as to the acceptability by audiences of any of the programs we broadcast. Further, because we compete with other broadcast stations for certain programming, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain any desired programming at costs that we believe are reasonable. Cable-network programming, combined with increased access to cable, satellite TV, and internet video streaming services, has become a significant competitor for broadcast television programming viewers. Cable networks’ viewership and advertising share have increased due to the growth in MVPD and internet video streaming services, penetration (the percentage of television households that are connected to an MVPD or internet video system) and increased investments in programming by cable networks or internet video. Further increases in the advertising share of cable networks and internet video streaming services could materially adversely affect the advertising revenue of our television stations.      24             In addition, technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of programming alternatives, such as internet websites, mobile apps and wireless carriers, direct-to-consumer video distribution systems, and home entertainment systems have further fractionalized television viewing audiences and resulted in additional challenges to revenue generation. New technologies and methods of buying advertising also present an additional competitive challenge, as competitors may offer products and services such as the ability to purchase advertising programmatically or bundled offline and online advertising, aimed at more efficiently capturing advertising spend. Our inability or failure to broadcast popular programs, or otherwise maintain viewership for any reason, including as a result of increases in programming alternatives, or our loss of advertising due to technological changes, could result in a lack of advertisers, or a reduction in the amount advertisers are willing to pay us to advertise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our defined benefit pension plan obligation is currently underfunded, and, if certain factors worsen, we may have to make significant cash payments, which could reduce the cash available for our business. We have underfunded obligations under our defined benefit pension plan. Notwithstanding that our pension plan is frozen with regard to any future benefit accruals, the funded status of our pension plan is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of certain market interest rates and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations. Unfavorable returns on the plan’s assets or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations may materially change the timing and amount of required plan funding, which could reduce the cash available for our business. In addition, any future decreases in the discount rate used to determine pension obligations could result in an increase in the valuation of pension obligations, which could affect the reported funding status of our pension plan and future contributions. We may be unable to maintain or increase our digital advertising revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. We generate a portion of our advertising revenue from the sale of advertisements on our digital sites. Our ability to maintain and increase this advertising revenue is largely dependent upon the number of users actively visiting our internet sites and using our digital apps. As a result, we must increase user engagement with our internet sites in order to increase our advertising revenue. Because digital advertising techniques are evolving, if our content, technology and advertisement serving techniques do not evolve to meet the changing needs of advertisers, our advertising revenue could also decline. Changes in our business model, advertising inventory or initiatives could also cause a decrease in our internet advertising revenue. We do not have long-term agreements with most of our digital advertisers. Any termination, change or decrease in our relationships with our largest digital advertising clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. If we do not maintain or increase our digital advertising revenue, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.      25             We have, in the past, incurred impairment charges on our goodwill and/or broadcast licenses, and any such future charges may have a material effect on the value of our total assets. As of December 31, 2019, the book value of our broadcast licenses was $3.6 billion and the book value of our goodwill was $1.4 billion, in comparison to total assets of $7.0 billion. Not less than annually, and more frequently if necessary, we are required to evaluate our goodwill and broadcast licenses to determine if the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value. If the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value, we will be required to record a non-cash expense to write down the book value of the intangible asset to the estimated fair value. We cannot make any assurances that any required impairment charges will not have a material adverse effect on our total assets. Recently enacted changes to the United States tax laws may have a material impact on our business or financial condition. On December 22, 2017, United States tax reform legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) was signed into law. The TCJA made substantial changes to United States tax law, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate, a limitation on deductibility of interest expense, a limitation on the use of net operating losses to offset future taxable income and the allowance of immediate expensing of capital expenditures. The TCJA will continue to have, significant effects on us, some of which may be adverse. The extent of the impact remains uncertain at this time and is subject to any other regulatory or administrative developments, including any further regulations or other guidance yet to be promulgated by the United States Internal Revenue Service. The TCJA contains numerous, complex provisions that could affect us. Cybersecurity risks could affect our operating effectiveness. We use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. Our revenues are increasingly dependent on digital products. Such use exposes us to potential cyber incidents resulting from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents could include, but are not limited to, unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, data corruption or operational disruption. The results of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, business interruption, disclosure of nonpublic information, decreased advertising revenues, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation, financial consequences and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence, any or all of which could adversely affect our business. Although we have systems and processes in place to protect against risks associated with cyber incidents, depending on the nature of an incident, these protections may not be fully sufficient. Certain stockholders or groups of stockholders have the ability to exert significant influence over us. Hilton H. Howell, Jr., our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is the husband of Robin R. Howell, a member of our Board of Directors (collectively with other members of their family, the “Howell-Robinson Family”). As a result of their significant stockholdings and positions on the Board of Directors, the Howell-Robinson Family is able to exert significant influence over our policies and management, potentially in a manner which may not be consistent with the interests of our other stockholders. We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations and we depend on our subsidiaries for cash. We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations, other than our investments in our subsidiaries. Because we are a holding company, we are dependent upon the payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. These payments could be or become subject to dividend or other restrictions under applicable laws in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. Payments by our subsidiaries are also contingent upon the subsidiaries’ earnings. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our financial condition and ability to meet our obligations may be adversely affected.      26             RisksRelatedtoRegulatoryMatters Federal broadcasting industry regulations limit our operating flexibility. The FCC regulates all television broadcasters, including us. We must obtain FCC approval whenever we (i) apply for a new license, (ii) seek to renew, modify or assign a license, (iii) purchase a broadcast station and/or (iv) transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries that holds a license. Our FCC licenses are critical to our operations, and we cannot operate without them. We cannot be certain that the FCC will renew these licenses in the future or approve new acquisitions, mergers, divestitures or other business activities. Our failure to renew any licenses upon the expiration of any license term could have a material adverse effect on our business. Federal legislation and FCC rules have changed significantly in recent years and may continue to change. These changes may limit our ability to conduct our business in ways that we believe would be advantageous and may affect our operating results. The FCC can sanction us for programming broadcast on our stations that it finds to be indecent. Over the past several years, the FCC has increased its enforcement efforts regarding broadcast indecency and profanity and the statutory maximum fine for broadcasting indecent material is currently $414,454 per incident. In June 2012, the Supreme Court decided a challenge to the FCC’s indecency enforcement policies without resolving the scope of the FCC’s ability to regulate broadcast content. In August 2013, the FCC issued a Public Notice seeking comment on whether it should modify its indecency policies. The FCC has not yet issued a decision in this proceeding and the courts remain free to review the FCC’s current policy or any modifications thereto. The outcomes of these proceedings could affect future FCC policies in this area, and we are unable to predict the outcome of any such judicial proceeding, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The FCC’s duopoly restrictions limit our ability to own and operate multiple television stations in the same market. The FCC’s ownership rules generally prohibit us from owning or having “attributable interests” in two television stations that are located in the same market when one of the stations is ranked among the top-four stations in the market unless eight independently owned, full-power stations will remain in the market”). In November 2017, the FCC released an order that eliminated or relaxed several long-standing media ownership rules. However, in November 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated these rule changes and reinstated the prior, more restrictive, ownership rules. In December 2018, the FCC launched a new proceeding to consider whether further changes in the media ownership rules were necessary. The FCC also considers television Local Marketing Agreements (“LMAs”) (which are agreements under which a television station sells or provides more than 15% of the programming on another same-market television station) as “attributable interests.” With the previous ownership rules in effect, our ability to expand in our present markets through additional station acquisitions or LMAs may be constrained.      27             The FCC’s National Television Station Ownership Rule limits the maximum number of households we can reach. Under the FCC’s National Television Station Ownership Rule, a single television station owner may not reach more than 39% of United States households through commonly owned television stations, subject to a 50% discount of the number of television households attributable to UHF stations (the “UHF Discount”). In December 2017, the Commission issued an NPRM seeking comment on whether it should modify or eliminate the national cap, including the UHF Discount. This rule may constrain our ability to expand through additional station acquisitions. Currently our station portfolio reaches approximately 24% of total United States television households, or approximately 17% of total United States television households, after applying the UHF discount. The Company is subject to governmental oversight regarding compliance with antitrust law as well as related civil litigation. Various governmental agencies, including the DOJ, have authority to enforce the antitrust laws of the United States in the broadcast television industry. The DOJ has increased its enforcement activities within the industry. For example, in November 2018, the DOJ filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against six broadcasters, including Raycom, alleging an agreement to exchange competitively sensitive information. The broadcasters and the DOJ entered into a settlement agreement, which, among other things, prohibits the defendant broadcasters from exchanging competitively sensitive information and impose certain compliance requirements. No party to the settlement agreement, including Raycom, admitted to any wrongdoing. In addition, following the public disclosure of the DOJ’s investigation, several putative class action lawsuits were filed against various broadcasters, including Gray, asserting claims related to those reflected in the DOJ settlement. These lawsuits have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois for the purpose of coordinated and consolidated pretrial proceedings. We are unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings. Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Equity Securities The price and trading volume of our equity securities may be volatile. The price and trading volume of our equity securities may be volatile and subject to fluctuations. Some of the factors that could cause fluctuation in the stock price or trading volume of our equity securities include:   ●  general market and economic conditions and market trends, including in the television broadcast industry and the financial markets generally;    ●  the political, economic and social situation in the United States;    ●  actual or anticipated variations in operating results, including audience share ratings and financial results;    ●  inability to meet projections in revenue;    ●  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments or other business developments;    ●  technological innovations in the television broadcast industry;    ●  adoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;    ●  operations of competitors and the performance of competitors’ common stock;    ●  litigation or governmental action involving or affecting us or our subsidiaries;       28               ●  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;    ●  recruitment or departure of key personnel;    ●  purchases or sales of blocks of our common stock; and    ●  operating and stock performance of the companies that investors may consider to be comparable.  There can be no assurance that the price of our equity securities will not fluctuate or decline significantly. The stock market in recent years has experienced considerable price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies and that could adversely affect the price of our equity securities, regardless of our operating performance. Stock price volatility might be worse if the trading volume of shares of our equity securities is low. Furthermore, stockholders may initiate securities class action lawsuits if the market price of our equity securities were to decline significantly, which may cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management. We do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock or Class A common stock. To the extent a potential investor ascribes value to a dividend paying stock, the value of our stock may be correspondingly reduced.  Our Board of Directors has not declared a cash or stock dividend on either class of our common stock since 2008. The timing and amount of any future dividend is at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and they may be subject to limitations or restrictions in our 2019 Senior Credit Facility and other financing agreements we may be, or become, party to. We can provide no assurance when or if any future dividends will be declared on our common stock or Class A common stock. As a result, if and to the extent an investor ascribes value to a dividend-paying stock, the value of our common stock or Class A common stock may be correspondingly reduced. Additional issuances of equity securities would dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders and could reduce our earnings per share. We may issue additional equity securities in the future in connection with capital raises, acquisitions, strategic transactions or for other purposes. To the extent we issue substantial additional equity securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders would be diluted and our earnings per share could be reduced. Anti-takeover provisions contained in our Restated Articles of Incorporation (“Articles”) and our Bylaws, as amended (“Bylaws”), as well as provisions of Georgia law, could impair a takeover attempt. Our Articles and Bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging a prospective acquirer from making a tender offer for our shares of common stock or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. To the extent that these provisions discourage takeover attempts, they could deprive stockholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares. Moreover, these provisions could discourage accumulations of large blocks of common stock, thus depriving stockholders of any advantages which large accumulations of stock might provide. As a Georgia corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Georgia law, including Section 14-2-1132 of the Georgia Business Corporation Code. Section 14-2-1132 prevents some stockholders holding more than 10% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations unless the business combination was approved in advance by our Board of Directors or results in the stockholder holding more than 90% of our outstanding common stock.      29             Any provision of our Articles, our Bylaws or Georgia law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. We have the ability to issue additional preferred stock, which could affect the rights of holders of our common stock and Class A common stock. Including the shares of preferred stock issued in the Raycom Merger, our Articles allow our Board of Directors to issue up to 20 million shares of preferred stock and set forth the terms of such preferred stock. The terms of any such preferred stock, if issued, may adversely affect the dividend and liquidation rights of holders of our common stock. Holders of our Class A common stock have the right to 10 votes per share on all matters to be voted on by our stockholders and, consequently, the ability to exert significant influence over us. As a result of the 10 to 1 voting rights of holders of our Class A common stock, these stockholders are expected to be able to exert significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including mergers and other material transactions, and may be able to cause or prevent a change in the composition of our Board of Directors or a change in control of our Company that could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock. If securities analysts do not continue to publish research or reports about our business, or if they publish negative evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline. We expect that the trading price of our equity securities may be affected by research or reports that industry or financial analysts publish about our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade their evaluations, the price of our equity securities could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our Company, we could lose visibility in the market for our equity securities, which in turn could cause our stock prices to decline. Future sales of our Common Stock by the selling stockholders in connection with the Raycom Merger, or the perception in the public markets that such sales may occur, could cause the trading price of our Common Stock to decline. The issuance of our Common Stock to the selling stockholders in connection with the Raycom Merger could have the effect of depressing the market price for our Common Stock. The Company has filed a registration statement to register all of the shares of Common Stock issued to the selling stockholders in connection with the Raycom Merger. Sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock, including sales by the selling stockholders from time to time, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.      30             "
15,GTN,GRAY TELEVISION INC,2019-02-28,"Risk Factors
. In addition to the other information contained in, incorporated by reference into or otherwise referred to in this annual report on Form 10-K, you should consider carefully the following factors when evaluating our business. Any of these risks, or the occurrence of any of the events described in these risk factors, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently do not deem material could arise, any of which could also materially adversely affect us. This annual report on Form 10-K also contains and incorporates by reference forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the occurrence of one or more of the following risk factors.  Risks Related to Our Indebtedness We have substantial debt and have the ability to incur significant additional debt. The principal and interest payment obligations on such debt may restrict our future operations and impair our ability to meet our long-term obligations. Currently we have approximately $4.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness, excluding intercompany debt and deferred financing costs. Subject to our ability to meet certain borrowing conditions, we have the ability to incur significant additional debt, including secured debt under our un-drawn $200.0 million revolving credit facility under our senior credit facility (the “2019 Senior Credit Facility”). The terms of the indenture (the “2027 Notes Indenture”) governing our outstanding 7.0% senior notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”), the indenture (the “2026 Notes Indenture”) governing our outstanding 5.875% senior notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) and the indenture (the “2024 Notes Indenture”) governing our 5.125% senior notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) also permit us to incur additional indebtedness, subject to our ability to meet certain borrowing conditions. 18  Our substantial debt may have important consequences. For instance, it could:  ●require us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt, which would reduce funds available for other business purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions;  ●place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors that may have less debt and better access to capital resources;  ●limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes; and  ●make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations. Our ability to service our significant financial obligations depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow. This is partially subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, that future borrowings will be available to us under our 2019 Senior Credit Facility or any other credit facilities, or that we will be able to complete any necessary financings, in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our operations or pay our debts and other obligations, or to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts, at times or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Specifically, volatility in the capital markets may also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, or to refinance our existing debt, on terms or at times favorable to us. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to service our debt or other obligations, which could result in us being in default thereon, in which circumstances our lenders could cease making loans to us, and lenders or other holders of our debt could accelerate and declare due all outstanding obligations due under the respective agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on us. The agreements governing our various debt obligations impose restrictions on our operations and limit our ability to undertake certain corporate actions. The agreements governing our various debt obligations, including our 2019 Senior Credit Facility, the 2027 Notes Indenture, the 2026 Notes Indenture and the 2024 Notes Indenture (together, the “existing indentures” or the “indentures”), include covenants imposing significant restrictions on our operations. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These covenants place, or will place, restrictions on our ability to, among other things:  ●incur additional debt, subject to certain limitations;  ●declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders;  ●make investments or acquisitions;  ●create liens or use assets as security in other transactions; 19   ●issue guarantees;  ●merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets;  ●amend our articles of incorporation or bylaws;  ●engage in transactions with affiliates; and  ●purchase, sell or transfer certain assets. Any of these restrictions and limitations could make it more difficult for us to execute our business strategy. The existing indentures and our 2019 Senior Credit Facility requires us to comply with certain financial ratios or other covenants; our failure to do so would result in a default thereunder, which would have a material adverse effect on us. We are required to comply with certain financial or other covenants under the existing indentures and our 2019 Senior Credit Facility. Our ability to comply with these requirements may be affected by events affecting our business, but beyond our control, including prevailing general economic, financial and industry conditions. These covenants could have an adverse effect on us by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, investment, acquisition or other corporate opportunities. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the existing indentures or our 2019 Senior Credit Facility. Upon a default under any of our debt agreements, the lenders or debtholders thereunder could have the right to declare all amounts outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable, which could, in turn, trigger defaults under other debt obligations and could result in the termination of commitments of the lenders to make further extensions of credit under our 2019 Senior Credit Facility. If we were unable to repay our secured debt to our lenders, or were otherwise in default under any provision governing our outstanding secured debt obligations, our secured lenders could proceed against us and our subsidiary guarantors and against the collateral securing that debt. Any default resulting in an acceleration of outstanding indebtedness, a termination of commitments under our financing arrangements or lenders proceeding against the collateral securing such indebtedness would likely result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly. Borrowings under our 2019 Senior Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If the rates on which our borrowings are based were to increase from current levels, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available to service our other obligations would decrease. 20  Risks Related to Our Business The success of our business is dependent upon advertising revenues, which are seasonal and cyclical, and also fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our main source of revenue is the sale of advertising time and space. Our ability to sell advertising time and space depends on, among other things:  ●economic conditions in the areas where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole;  ●the popularity of the programming offered by our television stations;  ●changes in the population demographics in the areas where our stations are located;  ●local and national advertising price fluctuations, which can be affected by the availability of programming, the popularity of programming, and the relative supply of and demand for commercial advertising;  ●our competitors’ activities, including increased competition from other advertising-based mediums, particularly cable networks, MVPDs and the internet;  ●the duration and extent of any network preemption of regularly scheduled programming for any reason;  ●decisions by advertisers to withdraw or delay planned advertising expenditures for any reason;  ●labor disputes or other disruptions at major national advertisers, programming providers or networks; and  ●other factors beyond our control. Our results are also subject to seasonal and cyclical fluctuations. Seasonal fluctuations typically result in higher revenue and broadcast operating income in the second and fourth quarters rather than in the first and third quarters of each year. This seasonality is primarily attributable to advertisers’ increased expenditures in the spring and in anticipation of holiday season spending in the fourth quarter and an increase in television viewership during this period. In addition, we typically experience fluctuations in our revenue and broadcast operating income between even-numbered and odd- numbered years. In years in which there are impending elections for various state and national offices, which primarily occur in even-numbered years, political advertising revenue tends to increase, often significantly, and particularly during presidential election years. We consider political broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned from the sale of advertising to political candidates, political parties and special interest groups of advertisements broadcast by our stations that contain messages primarily focused on elections and/or public policy issues. In even-numbered years, we typically derive a material portion of our broadcast advertising revenue from political broadcast advertisers. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we derived approximately 14% and 2%, respectively, of our total revenue from political broadcast advertisers. If political broadcast advertising revenues declined, especially in an even-numbered year, our results of operations and financial condition could also be materially adversely affected. Also, our stations affiliated with the NBC Network broadcast Olympic Games and typically experience increased viewership and revenue during those broadcasts, which also occur in even-numbered years. As a result of the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenue and broadcast operating income, and the historically significant increase in our revenue and broadcast operating income during even-numbered years, it has been, and is expected to remain, difficult to engage in period-over-period comparisons of our revenue and results of operations. 21  Continued uncertain financial and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Financial and economic conditions continue to be uncertain over the longer term and the continuation or worsening of such conditions could reduce consumer confidence and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. If consumer confidence were to decline, this decline could negatively affect our advertising customers’ businesses and their advertising budgets. In addition, volatile economic conditions could have a negative impact on our industry or the industries of our customers who advertise on our stations, resulting in reduced advertising sales. Furthermore, it may be possible that actions taken by any governmental or regulatory body for the purpose of stabilizing the economy or financial markets will not achieve their intended effect. In addition to any negative direct consequences to our business or results of operations arising from these financial and economic developments, some of these actions may adversely affect financial institutions, capital providers, advertisers or other consumers on whom we rely, including for access to future capital or financing arrangements necessary to support our business. Our inability to obtain financing in amounts and at times necessary could make it more difficult or impossible to meet our obligations or otherwise take actions in our best interests. Our dependence upon a limited number of advertising categories could adversely affect our business. We consider broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned primarily from the sale of advertisements broadcast by our stations. Although no single customer represented more than 5% of our broadcast advertising revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 or 2017, we derived a material portion of non-political broadcast advertising revenue from advertisers in a limited number of industries, particularly the automotive industry. During each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 we derived approximately 25% of our total broadcast advertising revenue from our advertisers in the automotive industry. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if broadcast advertising revenue from the automotive, or certain other industries, such as the medical, restaurant, communications, or furniture and appliances, industries, declined. We intend to continue to evaluate growth opportunities through strategic acquisitions, and there are significant risks associated with an acquisition strategy. We intend to continue to evaluate opportunities for growth through selective acquisitions of television stations or station groups. There can be no assurances that we will be able to identify any suitable acquisition candidates, and we cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing or completing any acquisitions, or what the consequences of not completing any acquisitions would be. Consummation of any proposed acquisition at any time may also be subject to various conditions such as compliance with FCC rules and policies. Consummation of acquisitions may also be subject to antitrust or other regulatory requirements. In addition, as we operate in a highly regulated industry, we could be subject to litigation, government investigations and enforcement actions on a variety of matters, the result of which could limit our acquisition strategy. An acquisition strategy involves numerous other risks, including risks associated with:  ●identifying suitable acquisition candidates and negotiating definitive purchase agreements on satisfactory terms;  ●integrating operations and systems and managing a large and geographically diverse group of stations; 22   ●obtaining financing to complete acquisitions, which financing may not be available to us at times, in amounts, or at rates acceptable to us, if at all, and potentially the related risks associated with increased debt;  ●diverting our management’s attention from other business concerns;  ●potentially losing key employees; and  ●potential changes in the regulatory approval process that may make it materially more expensive, or materially delay our ability, to consummate any proposed acquisitions. Our failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates, or to complete any acquisitions and integrate any acquired business, or to obtain the expected benefits therefrom, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may fail to realize any benefits and incur unanticipated losses related to any acquisition. The success of any strategic acquisition depends, in part, on our ability to successfully combine the acquired business and assets with our business and our ability to successfully manage the assets so acquired. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition. Successful integration may also be hampered by any differences between the operations and corporate culture of the two organizations. Additionally, general market and economic conditions may inhibit our successful integration of any business. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of an acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Finally, any cost savings that are realized may be offset by losses in revenues from the acquired business, any assets or operations disposed of in connection therewith or otherwise, or charges to earnings in connection with such acquisitions. We must purchase television programming in advance of knowing whether a particular show will be popular enough for us to recoup our costs. One of our most significant costs is for the purchase of television programming. If a particular program is not sufficiently popular among audiences in relation to the cost we pay for such program, we may not be able to sell enough related advertising time for us to recover the costs we pay to broadcast the program. We also must usually purchase programming several years in advance, and we may have to commit to purchase more than one year’s worth of programming, resulting in the incurrence of significant costs in advance of our receipt of any related revenue. We may also replace programs that are performing poorly before we have recaptured any significant portion of the costs we incurred in obtaining such programming or fully expensed the costs for financial reporting purposes. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues, result in the incurrence of impairment charges or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues. We are highly dependent upon our network affiliations, and our business and results of operations may be materially affected if a network (i) terminates its affiliation with us, (ii) significantly changes the economic terms and conditions of any future affiliation agreements with us or (iii) significantly changes the type, quality or quantity of programming provided to us under an affiliation agreement. Our business depends in large part on the success of our network affiliations. Nearly all of our stations are directly or indirectly affiliated with at least one of the four major broadcast networks pursuant to a separate affiliation agreement. Each affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the affiliated network during the term of the related agreement. Our affiliation agreements generally expire at various dates through December 2023. 23  If we cannot enter into affiliation agreements to replace any agreements in advance of their expiration, we would no longer be able to carry the affiliated network’s programming. This loss of programming would require us to seek to obtain replacement programming. Such replacement programming may involve higher costs and may not be as attractive to our target audiences, thereby reducing our ability to generate advertising revenue. Furthermore, our concentration of CBS and/or NBC affiliates makes us particularly sensitive to adverse changes in our business relationship with, and the general success of, CBS and/or NBC. We can give no assurance that any future affiliation agreements will have economic terms or conditions equivalent to or more advantageous to us than our current agreements. If in the future a network or networks impose more adverse economic terms upon us, such event or events could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, if we are unable to renew or replace any existing affiliation agreements, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations under our existing or any future retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs and/or secure payment of retransmission consent fees under such agreements. Furthermore, if in the future a network limited or removed our ability to retransmit network programming to MVPDs, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations or criteria for fees under any existing or any future retransmission consent agreements. In either case, such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are also dependent upon our retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs, and we cannot predict the outcome of potential regulatory changes to the retransmission consent regime. We are also dependent, in significant part, on our retransmission consent agreements. Our current retransmission consent agreements expire at various times over the next several years. No assurances can be provided that we will be able to renegotiate all of such agreements on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. The failure to renegotiate such agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our ability to successfully negotiate future retransmission consent agreements may be hindered by potential legislative or regulatory charges to the framework under which these agreements are negotiated. For example, on March 31, 2014, the FCC amended its rules governing “good faith” retransmission consent negotiations to provide that it is a per se violation of the statutory duty to negotiate in good faith for a television broadcast station that is ranked among the top-four stations in a market (as measured by audience share) to negotiate retransmission consent jointly with another top-four station in the same market if the stations are not commonly owned. As part of STELAR, Congress further tightened the restriction to prohibit joint negotiation with any television station in the same market unless the stations are under common de jure control. We currently are not a party to any agreements that delegate our authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any of our television stations or grant us authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any other television station. Nevertheless, we cannot predict how this restriction might impact future opportunities. The FCC also has sought comment on whether it should modify or eliminate the network non- duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. If, however, the FCC eliminates or relaxes its rules enforcing our program exclusivity rights, it could affect our ability to negotiate future retransmission consent agreements, and it could harm our ratings and advertising revenue if cable and satellite operators import duplicative programming. 24  In addition, certain online video distributors (“OVDs”) have explored streaming broadcast programming over the internet without approval from or payments to the broadcaster. The majority of federal courts have issued preliminary injunctions enjoining these OVDs from streaming broadcast programming because the courts have generally concluded that OVDs are unlikely to demonstrate that they are eligible for the statutory copyright license that provides cable operators with the requisite copyrights to retransmit broadcast programming, although in July 2015 a district court concluded that OVDs should be eligible for the statutory copyright license. We cannot predict the outcome of that appeal or whether the courts will continue to issue similar injunctions against future OVDs. Separately, on December 19, 2014, the FCC issued an NPRM proposing to classify certain OVDs as MVPDs for purposes of certain FCC carriage rules. If the FCC adopts its proposal, OVDs would need to negotiate for consent from broadcasters before they retransmit broadcast signals. We cannot predict whether the FCC will adopt its proposal or other modified rules that might weaken our rights to negotiate with OVDs. In September 2015, the FCC, in accordance with STELAR, issued an NPRM to review the “totality of the circumstances test” used to evaluate whether broadcast stations and MVPDs are negotiating for retransmission consent in good faith. In a July 14, 2016 blog post, the Chairman of the FCC announced that the FCC will not be adopting additional rules governing the retransmission consent process as a part of this proceeding. Instead, the FCC will monitor retransmission consent negotiations and rule on good-faith-negotiation complaints on a case-by-case basis. We cannot predict whether this approach will affect our ability to negotiate retransmission consent agreements, including the rates that we obtain from MVPDs, nor can we predict whether the FCC might reopen this proceeding in the future. The FCC also has taken other actions to implement various provisions of STELAR affecting the carriage of television stations, including (i) adopting rules that allow for the modification of satellite television markets in order to ensure that satellite operators carry the broadcast stations of most interest to their communities, (ii) prohibiting a television station from limiting the ability of an MVPD to carry into its local market television signals that are deemed significantly viewed; and (iii) eliminating the “sweeps prohibition,” which had precluded cable operators from deleting or repositioning local commercial television stations during “sweeps” ratings periods. Congress also continues to consider various changes to the statutory scheme governing retransmission of broadcast programming. Some of the proposed bills would make it more difficult to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with large MVPDs and would weaken our leverage to seek market-based compensation for our programming. We cannot predict whether any of these proposals will become law, and, if any do, we cannot determine the effect that any statutory changes would have on our business. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Competition occurs on multiple levels (for audiences, programming and advertisers) and is based on a variety of factors. If we are not able to successfully compete in all relevant aspects, our revenues will be materially adversely affected. Television stations compete for audiences, certain programming (including news) and advertisers. Signal coverage and carriage on MVPD systems also materially affect a television station’s competitive position. With respect to audiences, stations compete primarily based on broadcast program popularity. We cannot provide any assurances as to the acceptability by audiences of any of the programs we broadcast. Further, because we compete with other broadcast stations for certain programming, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain any desired programming at costs that we believe are reasonable. Cable-network programming, combined with increased access to cable and satellite TV, has become a significant competitor for broadcast television programming viewers. Cable networks’ viewership and advertising share have increased due to the growth in MVPD penetration (the percentage of television households that are connected to a MVPD system) and increased investments in programming by cable networks. Further increases in the advertising share of cable networks could materially adversely affect the advertising revenue of our television stations. 25  In addition, technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of programming alternatives, such as internet websites, mobile apps and wireless carriers, direct-to-consumer video distribution systems, and home entertainment systems have further fractionalized television viewing audiences and resulted in additional challenges to revenue generation. New technologies and methods of buying advertising also present an additional competitive challenge, as competitors may offer products and services such as the ability to purchase advertising programmatically or bundled offline and online advertising, aimed at more efficiently capturing advertising spend. Our inability or failure to broadcast popular programs, or otherwise maintain viewership for any reason, including as a result of increases in programming alternatives, or our loss of advertising due to technological changes, could result in a lack of advertisers, or a reduction in the amount advertisers are willing to pay us to advertise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our defined benefit pension plan obligation is currently underfunded, and, if certain factors worsen, we may have to make significant cash payments, which could reduce the cash available for our business. We have underfunded obligations under our defined benefit pension plan. Notwithstanding that our pension plan is frozen with regard to any future benefit accruals, the funded status of our pension plan is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of certain market interest rates and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations. Unfavorable returns on the plan’s assets or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations may materially change the timing and amount of required plan funding, which could reduce the cash available for our business. In addition, any future decreases in the discount rate used to determine pension obligations could result in an increase in the valuation of pension obligations, which could affect the reported funding status of our pension plan and future contributions. We may be unable to maintain or increase our internet advertising revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. We generate a portion of our advertising revenue from the sale of advertisements on our internet sites. Our ability to maintain and increase this advertising revenue is largely dependent upon the number of users actively visiting our internet sites. As a result, we must increase user engagement with our internet sites in order to increase our advertising revenue. Because internet advertising techniques are evolving, if our technology and advertisement serving techniques do not evolve to meet the changing needs of advertisers, our advertising revenue could also decline. Changes in our business model, advertising inventory or initiatives could also cause a decrease in our internet advertising revenue. We do not have long-term agreements with most of our internet advertisers. Any termination, change or decrease in our relationships with our largest advertising clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. If we do not maintain or increase our advertising revenue, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We have, in the past, incurred impairment charges on our goodwill and/or broadcast licenses, and any such future charges may have a material effect on the value of our total assets. As of December 31, 2018, the book value of our broadcast licenses was $1.5 billion and the book value of our goodwill was $612.4 million, in comparison to total assets of $4.2 billion. In addition, the recently completed Raycom Merger will add significant amounts to these values. Not less than annually, and more frequently if necessary, we are required to evaluate our goodwill and broadcast licenses to determine if the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value. If the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value, we will be required to record a non-cash expense to write down the book value of the intangible asset to the estimated fair value. We cannot make any assurances that any required impairment charges will not have a material adverse effect on our total assets. 26  Recently enacted changes to the U.S. tax laws may have a material impact on our business or financial condition. On December 22, 2017, U.S. tax reform legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) was signed into law. The TCJA made substantial changes to U.S. tax law, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate, a limitation on deductibility of interest expense, a limitation on the use of net operating losses to offset future taxable income and the allowance of immediate expensing of capital expenditures. The TCJA will continue to have, significant effects on us, some of which may be adverse. The extent of the impact remains uncertain at this time and is subject to any other regulatory or administrative developments, including any further regulations or other guidance yet to be promulgated by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The TCJA contains numerous, complex provisions that could affect us. Cybersecurity risks could affect our operating effectiveness. We use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. Our revenues are increasingly dependent on digital products. Such use exposes us to potential cyber incidents resulting from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents could include, but are not limited to, unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, data corruption or operational disruption. The results of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, business interruption, disclosure of nonpublic information, decreased advertising revenues, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation, financial consequences and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence, any or all of which could adversely affect our business. Although we have systems and processes in place to protect against risks associated with cyber incidents, depending on the nature of an incident, these protections may not be fully sufficient. Certain stockholders or groups of stockholders have the ability to exert significant influence over us. Hilton H. Howell, Jr., our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, is the husband of Robin R. Howell, a member of our Board of Directors (collectively with other members of their family, the “Howell-Robinson Family”). As a result of their significant stockholdings and positions on the Board of Directors, the Howell-Robinson Family is able to exert significant influence over our policies and management, potentially in a manner which may not be consistent with the interests of our other stockholders. We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations and we depend on our subsidiaries for cash. We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations, other than our investments in our subsidiaries. Because we are a holding company, we are dependent upon the payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. These payments could be or become subject to dividend or other restrictions under applicable laws in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. Payments by our subsidiaries are also contingent upon the subsidiaries’ earnings. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our financial condition and ability to meet our obligations may be adversely affected. 27  Risks Related to Regulatory Matters Federal broadcasting industry regulations limit our operating flexibility. The FCC regulates all television broadcasters, including us. We must obtain FCC approval whenever we (i) apply for a new license, (ii) seek to renew, modify or assign a license, (iii) purchase a broadcast station and/or (iv) transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries that holds a license. Our FCC licenses are critical to our operations, and we cannot operate without them. We cannot be certain that the FCC will renew these licenses in the future or approve new acquisitions, mergers, divestitures or other business activities. Our failure to renew any licenses upon the expiration of any license term could have a material adverse effect on our business. Federal legislation and FCC rules have changed significantly in recent years and may continue to change. These changes may limit our ability to conduct our business in ways that we believe would be advantageous and may affect our operating results. The FCC can sanction us for programming broadcast on our stations that it finds to be indecent. Over the past several years, the FCC has increased its enforcement efforts regarding broadcast indecency and profanity and the statutory maximum fine for broadcasting indecent material is currently $325,000 per incident. In June 2012, the Supreme Court decided a challenge to the FCC’s indecency enforcement without resolving the scope of the FCC’s ability to regulate broadcast content. In August 2013, the FCC issued a Public Notice seeking comment on whether it should modify its indecency policies. The FCC has not yet issued a decision in this proceeding and the courts remain free to review the FCC’s current policy or any modifications thereto. The outcomes of these proceedings could affect future FCC policies in this area, and we are unable to predict the outcome of any such judicial proceeding, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The FCC’s duopoly restrictions limit our ability to own and operate multiple television stations in the same market. The FCC’s ownership rules generally prohibit us from owning or having “attributable interests” in two television stations that are located in the same markets in which our stations are licensed and at least one station is ranked among the top-four stations in the market (the “Top Four Prohibition”). In November 2017, the FCC released an Order that eliminated or relaxed several long-standing media ownership rules. The Order (i) eliminated the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule; (ii) eliminated the radio/television cross-ownership rule; (iii) loosened the existing rules governing ownership of local television stations by agreeing to consider requests for waivers of the Top Four Prohibition on a case-by-case basis; and (iv) reversed the FCC’s earlier decision to treat joint sales agreements (“JSAs”) as attributable ownership interests. In December 2018, the FCC launched a new proceeding to consider whether further changes in the media ownership rules were necessary. The FCC also considers television Local Marketing Agreements (“LMAs”) (which are agreements under which a television station sells or provides more than 15 percent of the programming on another same-market television station) as “attributable interests.” While the ownership rules have been relaxed, these rules still constrain our ability to expand in our present markets through additional station acquisitions or LMAs. 28  The FCC’s National Television Station Ownership Rule limits the maximum number of households we can reach. Under the FCC’s National Television Station Ownership Rule, a single television station owner may not reach more than 39 percent of U.S. households through commonly owned television stations, subject to a 50 percent discount of the number of television households attributable to UHF stations (the “UHF Discount”). In December 2017, the Commission issued an NPRM seeking comment on whether it should modify or eliminate the national cap, including the UHF Discount. This rule may constrain our ability to expand through additional station acquisitions. Currently our station portfolio reaches approximately 24% of total United States television households. The Company is subject to governmental oversight regarding compliance with antitrust law as well as related civil litigation. Various governmental agencies, including the DOJ, have authority to enforce the antitrust laws of the United States in the broadcast television industry.  In the last year, the DOJ has increased its enforcement activities within the industry. For example in November 2018, the DOJ filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against six broadcasters, including Raycom, alleging an agreement to exchange competitively sensitive information. Simultaneously, the DOJ filed a settlement in the form of a proposed final judgment. If approved by the court, the settlement would, among other things, prohibit the defendant broadcasters from exchanging competitively sensitive information and impose certain compliance requirements. No party to the settlement agreement, including Raycom, admitted to any wrongdoing. In addition, following the public disclosure of the DOJ investigation, several putative class action lawsuits were filed against various broadcasters, including Gray, asserting claims related to those reflected in the DOJ proposed settlement. These lawsuits have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois for the purpose of coordinated and consolidated pretrial proceedings. We are unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings. Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Equity Securities The price and trading volume of our equity securities may be volatile. The price and trading volume of our equity securities may be volatile and subject to fluctuations. Some of the factors that could cause fluctuation in the stock price or trading volume of our equity securities include:  ●general market and economic conditions and market trends, including in the television broadcast industry and the financial markets generally;  ●the political, economic and social situation in the United States;  ●actual or anticipated variations in operating results, including audience share ratings and financial results;  ●inability to meet projections in revenue;  ●announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments or other business developments;  ●technological innovations in the television broadcast industry;  ●adoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;  ●operations of competitors and the performance of competitors’ common stock; 29   ●litigation or governmental action involving or affecting us or our subsidiaries;  ●changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;  ●recruitment or departure of key personnel;  ●purchases or sales of blocks of our common stock; and  ●operating and stock performance of the companies that investors may consider to be comparable. There can be no assurance that the price of our equity securities will not fluctuate or decline significantly. The stock market in recent years has experienced considerable price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies and that could adversely affect the price of our equity securities, regardless of our operating performance. Stock price volatility might be worse if the trading volume of shares of our equity securities is low. Furthermore, stockholders may initiate securities class action lawsuits if the market price of our equity securities were to decline significantly, which may cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management. We do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock or Class A common stock. To the extent a potential investor ascribes value to a dividend paying stock, the value of our stock may be correspondingly reduced.  Our Board of Directors has not declared a cash or stock dividend on either class of our common stock since 2008. The timing and amount of any future dividend is at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and they may be subject to limitations or restrictions in our senior credit facility and other financing agreements we may be, or become, party to. We can provide no assurance when or if any future dividends will be declared on our common stock or Class A common stock. As a result, if and to the extent an investor ascribes value to a dividend-paying stock, the value of our common stock or Class A common stock may be correspondingly reduced. Additional issuances of equity securities would dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders and could reduce our earnings per share. We may issue additional equity securities in the future in connection with capital raises, acquisitions, strategic transactions or for other purposes. To the extent we issue substantial additional equity securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders would be diluted and our earnings per share could be reduced. Anti-takeover provisions contained in our Restated Articles of Incorporation (“Articles”) and our Bylaws, as amended (“Bylaws”), as well as provisions of Georgia law, could impair a takeover attempt. Our Articles and Bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging a prospective acquirer from making a tender offer for our shares of common stock or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. To the extent that these provisions discourage takeover attempts, they could deprive stockholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares. Moreover, these provisions could discourage accumulations of large blocks of common stock, thus depriving stockholders of any advantages which large accumulations of stock might provide. As a Georgia corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Georgia law, including Section 14-2-1132 of the Georgia Business Corporation Code. Section 14-2-1132 prevents some stockholders holding more than 10% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations unless the business combination was approved in advance by our Board of Directors or results in the stockholder holding more than 90% of our outstanding common stock. 30  Any provision of our Articles, our Bylaws or Georgia law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. We have the ability to issue additional preferred stock, which could affect the rights of holders of our common stock and Class A common stock. Including the shares of preferred stock issued in the Raycom Merger, our Articles allow our Board of Directors to issue up to 20 million shares of preferred stock and set forth the terms of such preferred stock. The terms of any such preferred stock, if issued, may adversely affect the dividend and liquidation rights of holders of our common stock. Holders of our Class A common stock have the right to 10 votes per share on all matters to be voted on by our stockholders and, consequently, the ability to exert significant influence over us. As a result of the 10 to 1 voting rights of holders of our Class A common stock, these stockholders are expected to be able to exert significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including mergers and other material transactions, and may be able to cause or prevent a change in the composition of our Board of Directors or a change in control of our Company that could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock. If securities analysts do not continue to publish research or reports about our business, or if they publish negative evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline. We expect that the trading price of our equity securities may be affected by research or reports that industry or financial analysts publish about our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade their evaluations, the price of our equity securities could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our Company, we could lose visibility in the market for our equity securities, which in turn could cause our stock prices to decline. Future sales of our Common Stock by the selling stockholders in connection with the Raycom Merger, or the perception in the public markets that such sales may occur, could cause the trading price of our Common Stock to decline. The issuance of our Common Stock to the selling stockholders in connection with the Raycom Merger could have the effect of depressing the market price for our Common Stock. The Company has filed a registration statement to register all of the shares of Common Stock issued to the selling stockholders in connection with the Raycom Merger. Sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock, including sales by the selling stockholders from time to time, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock. 31  Risks Related to the Raycom Merger We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits, including synergies, from the Raycom Merger, and our business and results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely impacted. There is no assurance that we will successfully or cost effectively integrate the Raycom business. As a result of the Raycom Merger, we now have significantly more television stations covering additional markets, and we have been required to expand the scope of our operations. Our management will be required to devote a significant amount of time and attention to the integration process, including managing a significantly larger and more diversified company than that before the consummation of the Raycom Merger and integrating operations of the Raycom business while carrying on the ongoing operations of our historical business. The process of integrating the business operations may cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our historical business. If our management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer and our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted. In addition, as a result of the Raycom Merger, we may identify additional risks and uncertainties not yet known to us. Even if we are able to successfully integrate the Raycom business, it may not be possible to realize the full benefits, including the synergies that are expected to result from the Raycom Merger, or realize these benefits within the time frame that is expected. Our expected cost savings, as well as any revenue or other synergies, are subject to significant business, economic, regulatory and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. If we fail to realize the benefits we anticipate from the Raycom Merger, our liquidity, results of operations or financial condition may be adversely impacted. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant transaction and merger-related integration costs in connection with the Raycom Merger and other transactions related thereto. We have paid, and expect to continue to pay, significant transaction costs in connection with the Raycom Merger and other transactions related thereto. These transaction costs include legal, accounting and financial advisory fees and expenses, expenses associated with indebtedness that we incurred in connection with the Raycom Merger and other transactions related thereto, filing fees, printing expenses, mailing expenses and other related charges. As a result of the Raycom Merger, we may also incur costs associated with integrating the operations of Raycom, and these costs may be significant and may have an adverse effect on our future operating results if the anticipated cost savings from the Raycom Merger and related transactions are not achieved. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the Raycom business should allow us to offset these incremental expenses over time, the net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. Uncertainties associated with the Raycom Merger may cause employees to leave the Company and may otherwise affect the future business and operations of the Company. Our success after the Raycom Merger depends in part upon our ability to retain key employees. As a result of the Raycom Merger, current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the Company and choose to pursue other opportunities, which could have an adverse effect on the Company. If key employees depart, the integration of Raycom may be more difficult and our business may be adversely affected. 32  "
13,GTN,GRAY TELEVISION INC,2018-02-27,"Risk Factors
. In addition to the other information contained in, incorporated by reference into or otherwise referred to in this annual report on Form 10-K, you should consider carefully the following factors when evaluating our business. Any of these risks, or the occurrence of any of the events described in these risk factors, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently do not deem material could arise, any of which could also materially adversely affect us. This annual report on Form 10-K also contains and incorporates by reference forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the occurrence of one or more of the following risk factors. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness We have substantial debt and have the ability to incur significant additional debt. The principal and interest payment obligations on such debt may restrict our future operations and impair our ability to meet our long-term obligations. At December 31, 2017, we had approximately $1.8 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness, excluding intercompany debt and deferred financing costs. Subject to our ability to meet certain borrowing conditions, we have the ability to incur significant additional debt, including secured debt under our un-drawn $100.0 million revolving credit facility under our senior credit facility (the “2017 Senior Credit Facility”). The terms of the indenture (the “2026 Notes Indenture”) governing our outstanding 5.875% senior notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) and the indenture (the “2024 Notes Indenture”) governing our 5.125% senior notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) also permit us to incur additional indebtedness, subject to our ability to meet certain borrowing conditions.  Our substantial debt may have important consequences. For instance, it could:  ●require us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt, which would reduce funds available for other business purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions;  ●place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors that may have less debt and better access to capital resources;  ●limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes; and  ●make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations. Our ability to service our significant financial obligations depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow. This is partially subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, that future borrowings will be available to us under our 2017 Senior Credit Facility or any other credit facilities, or that we will be able to complete any necessary financings, in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our operations or pay our debts and other obligations, or to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts, at times or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Specifically, volatility in the capital markets may also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, or to refinance our existing debt, on terms or at times favorable to us. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to service our debt or other obligations, which could result in us being in default thereon, in which circumstances our lenders could cease making loans to us, and lenders or other holders of our debt could accelerate and declare due all outstanding obligations due under the respective agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 16  The agreements governing our various debt obligations impose restrictions on our operations and limit our ability to undertake certain corporate actions. The agreements governing our various debt obligations, including our 2017 Senior Credit Facility, the 2026 Notes Indenture and the 2024 Notes Indenture, include covenants imposing significant restrictions on our operations. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These covenants place, or will place, restrictions on our ability to, among other things:  ●incur additional debt, subject to certain limitations;  ●declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders;  ●make investments or acquisitions;  ●create liens or use assets as security in other transactions;  ●issue guarantees;  ●merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets;  ●amend our articles of incorporation or bylaws;  ●engage in transactions with affiliates; and  ●purchase, sell or transfer certain assets. Any of these restrictions and limitations could make it more difficult for us to execute our business strategy. Our 2017 Senior Credit Facility requires us to comply with certain financial ratios and covenants; our failure to do so would result in a default thereunder, which would have a material adverse effect on us. We are required to comply with certain financial covenants under our 2017 Senior Credit Facility. Our ability to comply with these requirements may be affected by events affecting our business, but beyond our control, including prevailing general economic, financial and industry conditions. These covenants could have an adverse effect on us by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, investment, acquisition or other corporate opportunities. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under our 2017 Senior Credit Facility. Upon a default under any of our debt agreements, the lenders or debtholders thereunder could have the right to declare all amounts outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable, which could, in turn, trigger defaults under other debt obligations and could result in the termination of commitments of the lenders to make further extensions of credit under our 2017 Senior Credit Facility. If we were unable to repay our secured debt to our lenders, or were otherwise in default under any provision governing our outstanding secured debt obligations, our secured lenders could proceed against us and our subsidiary guarantors and against the collateral securing that debt. Any default resulting in an acceleration of outstanding indebtedness, a termination of commitments under our financing arrangements or lenders proceeding against the collateral securing such indebtedness would likely result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 17  Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly. Borrowings under our 2017 Senior Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If the rates on which our borrowings are based were to increase from current levels, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available to service our other obligations would decrease. Risks Related to Our Business The success of our business is dependent upon advertising revenues, which are seasonal and cyclical, and also fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our main source of revenue is the sale of advertising time and space. Our ability to sell advertising time and space depends on, among other things:  ●economic conditions in the areas where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole;  ●the popularity of the programming offered by our television stations;  ●changes in the population demographics in the areas where our stations are located;  ●local and national advertising price fluctuations, which can be affected by the availability of programming, the popularity of programming, and the relative supply of and demand for commercial advertising;  ●our competitors’ activities, including increased competition from other advertising-based mediums, particularly cable networks, MVPDs and the internet;  ●the duration and extent of any network preemption of regularly scheduled programming for any reason;  ●decisions by advertisers to withdraw or delay planned advertising expenditures for any reason;  ●labor disputes or other disruptions at major national advertisers, programming providers or networks; and  ●other factors beyond our control. 18  Our results are also subject to seasonal and cyclical fluctuations. Seasonal fluctuations typically result in higher revenue and broadcast operating income in the second and fourth quarters than in the first and third quarters of each year. This seasonality is primarily attributable to advertisers’ increased expenditures in the spring and in anticipation of holiday season spending in the fourth quarter and an increase in television viewership during this period. In addition, we typically experience fluctuations in our revenue and broadcast operating income between even-numbered and odd- numbered years. In years in which there are impending elections for various state and national offices, which primarily occur in even-numbered years, political advertising revenue tends to increase, often significantly, and particularly during presidential election years. We consider political broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned from the sale to political candidates, political parties and special interest groups of advertisements broadcast by our stations that contain messages primarily focused on elections and/or public policy issues. In even-numbered years, we typically derive a material portion of our broadcast advertising revenue from political broadcast advertisers. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we derived approximately 2% and 11%, respectively, of our total revenue from political broadcast advertisers. If political broadcast advertising revenues declined, especially in an even-numbered year, our results of operations and financial condition could also be materially adversely affected. Also, our stations affiliated with the NBC Network broadcast Olympic Games and typically experience increased viewership and revenue during those broadcasts, which also occur in even-numbered years. As a result of the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenue and broadcast operating income, and the historically significant increase in our revenue and broadcast operating income during even-numbered years, it has been, and is expected to remain, difficult to engage in period-over-period comparisons of our revenue and results of operations. Continued uncertain financial and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Financial and economic conditions continue to be uncertain over the longer term and the continuation or worsening of such conditions could reduce consumer confidence and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. If consumer confidence were to decline, this decline could negatively affect our advertising customers’ businesses and their advertising budgets. In addition, volatile economic conditions could have a negative impact on our industry or the industries of our customers who advertise on our stations, resulting in reduced advertising sales. Furthermore, it may be possible that actions taken by any governmental or regulatory body for the purpose of stabilizing the economy or financial markets will not achieve their intended effect. In addition to any negative direct consequences to our business or results of operations arising from these financial and economic developments, some of these actions may adversely affect financial institutions, capital providers, advertisers or other consumers on whom we rely, including for access to future capital or financing arrangements necessary to support our business. Our inability to obtain financing in amounts and at times necessary could make it more difficult or impossible to meet our obligations or otherwise take actions in our best interests. Our dependence upon a limited number of advertising categories could adversely affect our business. We consider broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned primarily from the sale of advertisements broadcast by our stations. Although no single customer represented more than 5% of our broadcast advertising revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 or 2016, we derived a material portion of non-political broadcast advertising revenue from advertisers in a limited number of industries, particularly the automotive industry. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 we derived approximately 25% and 22% of our total broadcast advertising revenue from our advertisers in the automotive industry. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if broadcast advertising revenue from the automotive, or certain other industries, such as the medical, restaurant, communications, or furniture and appliances, industries, declined. 19  We intend to continue to evaluate growth opportunities through strategic acquisitions, and there are significant risks associated with an acquisition strategy. We intend to continue to evaluate opportunities for growth through selective acquisitions of television stations or station groups. There can be no assurances that we will be able to identify any suitable acquisition candidates, and we cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing or completing any acquisitions, or what the consequences of not completing any acquisitions would be. Consummation of any proposed acquisition at any time may also be subject to various conditions such as compliance with FCC rules and policies. Consummation of acquisitions may also be subject to antitrust or other regulatory requirements. An acquisition strategy involves numerous other risks, including risks associated with:  ●identifying suitable acquisition candidates and negotiating definitive purchase agreements on satisfactory terms;  ●integrating operations and systems and managing a large and geographically diverse group of stations;  ●obtaining financing to complete acquisitions, which financing may not be available to us at times, in amounts, or at rates acceptable to us, if at all, and potentially the related risks associated with increased debt;  ●diverting our management’s attention from other business concerns;  ●potentially losing key employees; and  ●potential changes in the regulatory approval process that may make it materially more expensive, or materially delay our ability, to consummate any proposed acquisitions. Our failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates, or to complete any acquisitions and integrate any acquired business, or to obtain the expected benefits therefrom, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may fail to realize any benefits and incur unanticipated losses related to any acquisition. The success of any strategic acquisition depends, in part, on our ability to successfully combine the acquired business and assets with our business and our ability to successfully manage the assets so acquired. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Successful integration may also be hampered by any differences between the operations and corporate culture of the two organizations. Additionally, general market and economic conditions may inhibit our successful integration of any business. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Finally, any cost savings that are realized may be offset by losses in revenues from the acquired business, any assets or operations disposed of in connection therewith or otherwise, or charges to earnings in connection with such acquisitions. 20  We must purchase television programming in advance of knowing whether a particular show will be popular enough for us to recoup our costs. One of our most significant costs is for the purchase of television programming. If a particular program is not sufficiently popular among audiences in relation to the cost we pay for such program, we may not be able to sell enough related advertising time for us to recover the costs we pay to broadcast the program. We also must usually purchase programming several years in advance, and we may have to commit to purchase more than one year’s worth of programming, resulting in the incurrence of significant costs in advance of our receipt of any related revenue. We may also replace programs that are performing poorly before we have recaptured any significant portion of the costs we incurred in obtaining such programming or fully expensed the costs for financial reporting purposes. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues, result in the incurrence of impairment charges or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues. We are highly dependent upon our network affiliations, and our business and results of operations may be materially affected if a network (i) terminates its affiliation with us, (ii) significantly changes the economic terms and conditions of any future affiliation agreements with us or (iii) significantly changes the type, quality or quantity of programming provided to us under an affiliation agreement. Our business depends in large part on the success of our network affiliations. Nearly all of our stations are directly or indirectly affiliated with at least one of the four major broadcast networks pursuant to a separate affiliation agreement. Each affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the affiliated network during the term of the related agreement. Our affiliation agreements generally expire at various dates through December 2021.  If we cannot enter into affiliation agreements to replace any agreements in advance of their expiration, we would no longer be able to carry the affiliated network’s programming. This loss of programming would require us to seek to obtain replacement programming. Such replacement programming may involve higher costs and may not be as attractive to our target audiences, thereby reducing our ability to generate advertising revenue. Furthermore, our concentration of CBS and/or NBC affiliates makes us particularly sensitive to adverse changes in our business relationship with, and the general success of, CBS and/or NBC. We can give no assurance that any future affiliation agreements will have economic terms or conditions equivalent to or more advantageous to us than our current agreements. If in the future a network or networks impose more adverse economic terms upon us, such event or events could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, if we are unable to renew or replace any existing affiliation agreements, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations under our existing or any future retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs and/or secure payment of retransmission consent fees under such agreements. Furthermore, if in the future a network limited or removed our ability to retransmit network programming to MVPDs, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations or criteria for fees under any existing or any future retransmission consent agreements. In either case, such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are also dependent upon our retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs, and we cannot predict the outcome of potential regulatory changes to the retransmission consent regime. We are also dependent, in significant part, on our retransmission consent agreements. Our current retransmission consent agreements expire at various times over the next several years. No assurances can be provided that we will be able to renegotiate all of such agreements on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. The failure to renegotiate such agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 21  Our ability to successfully negotiate future retransmission consent agreements may be hindered by potential legislative or regulatory charges to the framework under which these agreements are negotiated. For example, on March 31, 2014, the FCC amended its rules governing “good faith” retransmission consent negotiations to provide that it is a per se violation of the statutory duty to negotiate in good faith for a television broadcast station that is ranked among the top-four stations in a market (as measured by audience share) to negotiate retransmission consent jointly with another top-four station in the same market if the stations are not commonly owned. As part of STELAR, Congress further tightened the restriction to prohibit joint negotiation with any television station in the same market unless the stations are under common de jure control. We currently are not a party to any agreements that delegate our authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any of our television stations or grant us authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any other television station. Nevertheless, we cannot predict how this restriction might impact future opportunities. The FCC also has sought comment on whether it should modify or eliminate the network non- duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. If, however, the FCC eliminates or relaxes its rules enforcing our program exclusivity rights, it could affect our ability to negotiate future retransmission consent agreements, and it could harm our ratings and advertising revenue if cable and satellite operators import duplicative programming. In addition, certain online video distributors (“OVDs”) have explored streaming broadcast programming over the internet without approval from or payments to the broadcaster. The majority of federal courts have issued preliminary injunctions enjoining these OVDs from streaming broadcast programming because the courts have generally concluded that OVDs are unlikely to demonstrate that they are eligible for the statutory copyright license that provides cable operators with the requisite copyrights to retransmit broadcast programming, although in July 2015 a district court concluded that OVDs should be eligible for the statutory copyright license. We cannot predict the outcome of that appeal or whether the courts will continue to issue similar injunctions against future OVDs. Separately, on December 19, 2014, the FCC issued an NPRM proposing to classify certain OVDs as MVPDs for purposes of certain FCC carriage rules. If the FCC adopts its proposal, OVDs would need to negotiate for consent from broadcasters before they retransmit broadcast signals. We cannot predict whether the FCC will adopt its proposal or other modified rules that might weaken our rights to negotiate with OVDs. In September 2015, the FCC, in accordance with STELAR, issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to review the “totality of the circumstances test” used to evaluate whether broadcast stations and MVPDs are negotiating for retransmission consent in good faith. In a July 14, 2016 blog post, the Chairman of the FCC announced that the FCC will not be adopting additional rules governing the retransmission consent process as a part of this proceeding. Instead, the FCC will monitor retransmission consent negotiations and rule on good-faith-negotiation complaints on a case-by-case basis. We cannot predict whether this approach will affect our ability to negotiate retransmission consent agreements, including the rates that we obtain from MVPDs, nor can we predict whether the FCC might reopen this proceeding in the future. The FCC also has taken other actions to implement various provisions of STELAR affecting the carriage of television stations, including (i) adopting rules that allow for the modification of satellite television markets in order to ensure that satellite operators carry the broadcast stations of most interest to their communities, (ii) prohibiting a television station from limiting the ability of an MVPD to carry into its local market television signals that are deemed significantly viewed; and (iii) eliminating the “sweeps prohibition,” which had precluded cable operators from deleting or repositioning local commercial television stations during “sweeps” ratings periods. Congress also continues to consider various changes to the statutory scheme governing retransmission of broadcast programming. Some of the proposed bills would make it more difficult to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with large MVPDs and would weaken our leverage to seek market-based compensation for our programming. We cannot predict whether any of these proposals will become law, and, if any do, we cannot determine the effect that any statutory changes would have on our business. 22  We operate in a highly competitive environment. Competition occurs on multiple levels (for audiences, programming and advertisers) and is based on a variety of factors. If we are not able to successfully compete in all relevant aspects, our revenues will be materially adversely affected. Television stations compete for audiences, certain programming (including news) and advertisers. Signal coverage and carriage on MVPD systems also materially affect a television station’s competitive position. With respect to audiences, stations compete primarily based on broadcast program popularity. We cannot provide any assurances as to the acceptability by audiences of any of the programs we broadcast. Further, because we compete with other broadcast stations for certain programming, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain any desired programming at costs that we believe are reasonable. Cable-network programming, combined with increased access to cable and satellite TV, has become a significant competitor for broadcast television programming viewers. Cable networks’ viewership and advertising share have increased due to the growth in MVPD penetration (the percentage of television households that are connected to a MVPD system) and increased investments in programming by cable networks. Further increases in the advertising share of cable networks could materially adversely affect the advertising revenue of our television stations. In addition, technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of programming alternatives, such as internet websites, mobile apps and wireless carriers, direct-to-consumer video distribution systems, and home entertainment systems have further fractionalized television viewing audiences and resulted in additional challenges to revenue generation. New technologies and methods of buying advertising also present an additional competitive challenge, as competitors may offer products and services such as the ability to purchase advertising programmatically or bundled offline and online advertising, aimed at more efficiently capturing advertising spend. Our inability or failure to broadcast popular programs, or otherwise maintain viewership for any reason, including as a result of increases in programming alternatives, or our loss of advertising due to technological changes, could result in a lack of advertisers, or a reduction in the amount advertisers are willing to pay us to advertise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our defined benefit pension plan obligation is currently underfunded, and, if certain factors worsen, we may have to make significant cash payments, which could reduce the cash available for our business. We have underfunded obligations under our defined benefit pension plan. Notwithstanding that our pension plan is frozen with regard to any future benefit accruals, the funded status of our pension plan is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of certain market interest rates and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations. Unfavorable returns on the plan’s assets or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations may materially change the timing and amount of required plan funding, which could reduce the cash available for our business. In addition, any future decreases in the discount rate used to determine pension obligations could result in an increase in the valuation of pension obligations, which could affect the reported funding status of our pension plan and future contributions. 23  We may be unable to maintain or increase our internet advertising revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. We generate a portion of our advertising revenue from the sale of advertisements on our internet sites. Our ability to maintain and increase this advertising revenue is largely dependent upon the number of users actively visiting our internet sites. As a result, we must increase user engagement with our internet sites in order to increase our advertising revenue. Because internet advertising techniques are evolving, if our technology and advertisement serving techniques do not evolve to meet the changing needs of advertisers, our advertising revenue could also decline. Changes in our business model, advertising inventory or initiatives could also cause a decrease in our internet advertising revenue. We do not have long-term agreements with most of our internet advertisers. Any termination, change or decrease in our relationships with our largest advertising clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. If we do not maintain or increase our advertising revenue, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We have, in the past, incurred impairment charges on our goodwill and/or broadcast licenses, and any such future charges may have a material effect on the value of our total assets. As of December 31, 2017, the book value of our broadcast licenses was $1.5 billion and the book value of our goodwill was $611.1 million, in comparison to total assets of $3.3 billion. Not less than annually, and more frequently if necessary, we are required to evaluate our goodwill and broadcast licenses to determine if the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value. If the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value, we will be required to record a non-cash expense to write down the book value of the intangible asset to the estimated fair value. We cannot make any assurances that any required impairment charges will not have a material adverse effect on our total assets. Recently enacted changes to the U.S. tax laws may have a material impact on our business or financial condition. On December 22, 2017, U.S. tax reform legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) was signed into law. The TCJA makes substantial changes to U.S. tax law, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate, a limitation on deductibility of interest expense, a limitation on the use of net operating losses to offset future taxable income and the allowance of immediate expensing of capital expenditures. The TCJA had, and we expect it to continue to have, significant effects on us, some of which may be adverse. The extent of the impact remains uncertain at this time and is subject to any other regulatory or administrative developments, including any regulations or other guidance yet to be promulgated by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The TCJA contains numerous, complex provisions that could affect us, and we continue to review and assess its potential impact on us. Cybersecurity risks could affect our operating effectiveness. We use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. Our revenues are increasingly dependent on digital products. Such use exposes us to potential cyber incidents resulting from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents could include, but are not limited to, unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, data corruption or operational disruption. The results of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, business interruption, disclosure of nonpublic information, decreased advertising revenues, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation, financial consequences and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence, any or all of which could adversely affect our business. Although we have systems and processes in place to protect against risks associated with cyber incidents, depending on the nature of an incident, these protections may not be fully sufficient. Certain stockholders or groups of stockholders have the ability to exert significant influence over us. Hilton H. Howell, Jr., our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, is the husband of Robin R. Howell, a member of our Board of Directors (collectively with other members of their family, the “Howell-Robinson Family”). As of February 23, 2018, the Howell-Robinson Family directly or indirectly beneficially owned shares representing approximately 39% of the outstanding combined voting power of our common stock and Class A common stock. As a result of these significant stockholdings and positions on the Board of Directors, the Howell-Robinson Family is able to exert significant influence over our policies and management, potentially in a manner which may not be consistent with the interests of our other stockholders. 24  We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations and we depend on our subsidiaries for cash. We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations, other than our investments in our subsidiaries. Because we are a holding company, we are dependent upon the payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. These payments could be or become subject to dividend or other restrictions under applicable laws in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. Payments by our subsidiaries are also contingent upon the subsidiaries’ earnings. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our financial condition and ability to meet our obligations may be adversely affected. Risks Related to Regulatory Matters Federal broadcasting industry regulations limit our operating flexibility. The FCC regulates all television broadcasters, including us. We must obtain FCC approval whenever we (i) apply for a new license, (ii) seek to renew, modify or assign a license, (iii) purchase a broadcast station and/or (iv) transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries that holds a license. Our FCC licenses are critical to our operations, and we cannot operate without them. We cannot be certain that the FCC will renew these licenses in the future or approve new acquisitions, mergers, divestitures or other business activities. Our failure to renew any licenses upon the expiration of any license term could have a material adverse effect on our business. Federal legislation and FCC rules have changed significantly in recent years and may continue to change. These changes may limit our ability to conduct our business in ways that we believe would be advantageous and may affect our operating results. The FCC can sanction us for programming broadcast on our stations that it finds to be indecent. Over the past several years, the FCC has increased its enforcement efforts regarding broadcast indecency and profanity and the statutory maximum fine for broadcasting indecent material is currently $325,000 per incident. In June 2012, the Supreme Court decided a challenge to the FCC’s indecency enforcement without resolving the scope of the FCC’s ability to regulate broadcast content. In August 2013, the FCC issued a Public Notice seeking comment on whether it should modify its indecency policies. The FCC has not yet issued a decision in this proceeding and the courts remain free to review the FCC’s current policy or any modifications thereto. The outcomes of these proceedings could affect future FCC policies in this area, and we are unable to predict the outcome of any such judicial proceeding, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The FCC’s duopoly restrictions limit our ability to own and operate multiple television stations in the same market. The FCC’s ownership rules generally prohibit us from owning or having “attributable interests” in two television stations that are located in the same markets in which our stations are licensed and at least one station is ranked among the top-four stations in the market (the “Top Four Prohibition”). In November 2017, the FCC released an Order that eliminated or relaxed several long-standing media ownership rules. The Order (i) eliminated the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule, (ii) eliminated the radio/television cross-ownership rule, (iii) loosened the existing rules governing ownership of local television stations by agreeing to consider requests for waivers of the Top Four Prohibition on a case-by-case basis, and (iv) reversed the FCC’s earlier decision to treat joint sales agreements (“JSAs”) as attributable ownership interests. The FCC also considers television Local Marketing Agreements (“LMAs”) (which are agreements under which a television station sells or provides more than 15 percent of the programming on another same-market television station) as “attributable interests.” While the ownership rules have been relaxed, these rules still constrain our ability to expand in our present markets through additional station acquisitions or LMAs. 25  The FCC’s National Television Station Ownership Rule limits the maximum number of households we can reach. Under the FCC’s National Television Station Ownership Rule, a single television station owner may not reach more than 39 percent of U.S. households through commonly owned television stations, subject to a 50 percent discount of the number of television households attributable to UHF stations (the “UHF Discount”). In December 2017, the Commission issued a notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on whether it should modify or eliminate the national cap, including the UHF Discount. This rule may constrain our ability to expand through additional station acquisitions. Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Equity Securities The price and trading volume of our equity securities may be volatile. The price and trading volume of our equity securities may be volatile and subject to fluctuations. Some of the factors that could cause fluctuation in the stock price or trading volume of our equity securities include:  ●general market and economic conditions and market trends, including in the television broadcast industry and the financial markets generally;  ●the political, economic and social situation in the United States;  ●actual or anticipated variations in operating results, including audience share ratings and financial results;  ●inability to meet projections in revenue;  ●announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments or other business developments;  ●technological innovations in the television broadcast industry;  ●adoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;  ●operations of competitors and the performance of competitors’ common stock;  ●litigation or governmental action involving or affecting us or our subsidiaries;  ●changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;  ●recruitment or departure of key personnel;  ●purchases or sales of blocks of our common stock; and  ●operating and stock performance of the companies that investors may consider to be comparable. There can be no assurance that the price of our equity securities will not fluctuate or decline significantly. The stock market in recent years has experienced considerable price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies and that could adversely affect the price of our equity securities, regardless of our operating performance. Stock price volatility might be worse if the trading volume of shares of our equity securities is low. Furthermore, stockholders may initiate securities class action lawsuits if the market price of our equity securities were to decline significantly, which may cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management. 26  We do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock or Class A common stock. To the extent a potential investor ascribes value to a dividend paying stock, the value of our stock may be correspondingly reduced.  Our Board of Directors has not declared a cash or stock dividend on either class of our common stock since 2008. The timing and amount of any future dividend is at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and they may be subject to limitations or restrictions in our senior credit facility and other financing agreements we may be, or become, party to. We can provide no assurance when or if any future dividends will be declared on our common stock or Class A common stock. As a result, if and to the extent an investor ascribes value to a dividend-paying stock, the value of our common stock or Class A common stock may be correspondingly reduced. Additional issuances of equity securities would dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders and could reduce our earnings per share. We may issue additional equity securities in the future in connection with capital raises, acquisitions, strategic transactions or for other purposes. To the extent we issue substantial additional equity securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders would be diluted and our earnings per share could be reduced. Anti-takeover provisions contained in our Restated Articles of Incorporation (“Articles”) and our Bylaws, as amended (“Bylaws”), as well as provisions of Georgia law, could impair a takeover attempt. Our Articles and Bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging a prospective acquirer from making a tender offer for our shares of common stock or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. To the extent that these provisions discourage takeover attempts, they could deprive stockholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares. Moreover, these provisions could discourage accumulations of large blocks of common stock, thus depriving stockholders of any advantages which large accumulations of stock might provide. As a Georgia corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Georgia law, including Section 14-2-1132 of the Georgia Business Corporation Code. Section 14-2-1132 prevents some stockholders holding more than 10% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations unless the business combination was approved in advance by our Board of Directors or results in the stockholder holding more than 90% of our outstanding common stock. Any provision of our Articles, our Bylaws or Georgia law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. We have the ability to issue preferred stock, which could affect the rights of holders of our common stock and Class A common stock. Our Articles allow our Board of Directors to issue up to 20 million shares of preferred stock and set forth the terms of such preferred stock. The terms of any such preferred stock, if issued, may adversely affect the dividend and liquidation rights of holders of our common stock. 27  Holders of our Class A common stock have the right to 10 votes per share on all matters to be voted on by our stockholders and, consequently, the ability to exert significant influence over us. As a result of the 10 to 1 voting rights of holders of our Class A common stock, these stockholders are expected to be able to exert significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including mergers and other material transactions, and may be able to cause or prevent a change in the composition of our Board of Directors or a change in control of our Company that could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock. If securities analysts do not continue to publish research or reports about our business, or if they publish negative evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline. We expect that the trading price of our equity securities may be affected by research or reports that industry or financial analysts publish about our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade their evaluations, the price of our equity securities could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our Company, we could lose visibility in the market for our equity securities, which in turn could cause our stock prices to decline. "
0,GTN,GRAY TELEVISION INC,2017-03-01,"Risk Factors
. In addition to the other information contained in, incorporated by reference into or otherwise referred to in this report, you should consider carefully the following factors when evaluating our business. Any of these risks, or the occurrence of any of the events described in these risk factors, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently do not deem material could arise, any of which could also materially adversely affect us. This report also contains and incorporates by reference forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the occurrence of one or more of the following risk factors. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness We have substantial debt and have the ability to incur significant additional debt. The principal and interest payment obligations on such debt may restrict our future operations and impair our ability to meet our long-term obligations. At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.8 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness, excluding intercompany debt and before deducting deferred financing costs. Subject to our ability to meet certain borrowing conditions, we currently have the ability to incur significant additional debt, including secured debt, under our senior credit facility (the “2017 Senior Credit Facility”), including under our un-drawn $100.0 million revolving credit facility. The terms of the indenture (the “2026 Notes Indenture”) governing our outstanding 5.875% senior notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) and the indenture (the “2024 Notes Indenture”) governing our 5.125% senior notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) also permit us to incur additional indebtedness, subject to our ability to meet certain borrowing conditions.  Our substantial debt may have important consequences. For instance, it could:  ●require us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt, which would reduce funds available for other business purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions;  ●place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors that may have less debt and better access to capital resources;  19   ●limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes; and   ●make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations. Our ability to service our significant financial obligations depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow. This is partially subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, that future borrowings will be available to us under our 2017 Senior Credit Facility or any other credit facilities, or that we will be able to complete any necessary financings, in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our operations or pay our debts and other obligations, or to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts, at times or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Specifically, volatility in the capital markets may also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, or to refinance our existing debt, on terms or at times favorable to us. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to service our debt or other obligations, which could result in us being in default thereon, in which circumstances our lenders could cease making loans to us, and lenders or other holders of our debt could accelerate and declare due all outstanding obligations due under the respective agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on us. The agreements governing our various debt obligations impose restrictions on our operations and limit our ability to undertake certain corporate actions. The agreements governing our various debt obligations, including the 2026 Notes Indenture, the 2024 Notes Indenture and our 2017 Senior Credit Facility, include covenants imposing significant restrictions on our operations. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These covenants place, or will place, restrictions on our ability to, among other things:  ●incur additional debt, subject to certain limitations;  ●declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders;  ●make investments or acquisitions;  ●create liens or use assets as security in other transactions;  ●issue guarantees;  ●merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets;  ●amend our articles of incorporation or bylaws;  ●engage in transactions with affiliates; and  ●purchase, sell or transfer certain assets. Any of these restrictions and limitations could make it more difficult for us to execute our business strategy.  20  Our 2017 Senior Credit Facility requires us to comply with certain financial ratios and covenants; our failure to do so would result in a default thereunder, which would have a material adverse effect on us. We are required to comply with certain financial covenants under our 2017 Senior Credit Facility. Our ability to comply with these requirements may be affected by events affecting our business, but beyond our control, including prevailing general economic, financial and industry conditions. These covenants could have an adverse effect on us by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, investment, acquisition or other corporate opportunities. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under our 2017 Senior Credit Facility. Upon a default under any of our debt agreements, the lenders or debtholders thereunder could have the right to declare all amounts outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable, which could, in turn, trigger defaults under other debt obligations and could result in the termination of commitments of the lenders to make further extensions of credit under our 2017 Senior Credit Facility. If we were unable to repay our secured debt to our lenders, or were otherwise in default under any provision governing our outstanding secured debt obligations, our secured lenders could proceed against us and the subsidiary guarantors and against the collateral securing that debt. Any default resulting in an acceleration of outstanding indebtedness, a termination of commitments under our financing arrangements or lenders proceeding against the collateral securing such indebtedness would likely result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly. Borrowings under our 2017 Senior Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or the base rate, as defined in the 2017 Senior Credit Facility, were to increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available to service our obligations, including making payments on the notes, would decrease. Risks Related to Our Business The success of our business is dependent upon advertising revenues, which are seasonal and cyclical, and also fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our main source of revenue is the sale of advertising time and space. Our ability to sell advertising time and space depends on, among other things:  ●economic conditions in the areas where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole;  ●the popularity of the programming offered by our television stations;  ●changes in the population demographics in the areas where our stations are located;    ●local and national advertising price fluctuations, which can be affected by the availability of programming, the popularity of programming, and the relative supply of and demand for commercial advertising;  ●our competitors’ activities, including increased competition from other advertising-based mediums, particularly cable networks, MVPDs and the internet;  21   ●the duration and extent of any network preemption of regularly scheduled programming for any reason;  ●decisions by advertisers to withdraw or delay planned advertising expenditures for any reason;  ●labor disputes or other disruptions at major national advertisers, programming providers or networks; and  ●other factors beyond our control. Our results are also subject to seasonal and cyclical fluctuations. Seasonal fluctuations typically result in higher revenue and broadcast operating income in the second and fourth quarters than in the first and third quarters of each year. This seasonality is primarily attributable to advertisers’ increased expenditures in the spring and in anticipation of holiday season spending in the fourth quarter and an increase in television viewership during this period. In addition, we typically experience fluctuations in our revenue and broadcast operating income between even-numbered and odd- numbered years. In years in which there are impending elections for various state and national offices, which primarily occur in even-numbered years, political advertising revenue tends to increase, often significantly, and particularly during presidential election years. We consider political broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned from the sale to political candidates, political parties and special interest groups of advertisements broadcast by our stations that contain messages primarily focused on elections and/or public policy issues. In even-numbered years, we typically derive a material portion of our broadcast advertising revenue from political broadcast advertisers. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we derived approximately 11% and 3%, respectively, of our total revenue from political broadcast advertisers. If political broadcast advertising revenues declined, especially in an even-numbered year, our results of operations and financial condition could also be materially adversely affected. Also, our stations affiliated with the NBC Network broadcast Olympic Games and typically experience increased viewership and revenue during those broadcasts, which also occur in even-numbered years. As a result of the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenue and broadcast operating income, and the historically significant increase in our revenue and broadcast operating income during even-numbered years, potential investors are cautioned that it has been, and is expected to remain, difficult to engage in period-over-period comparisons of our revenue and results of operations. Continued uncertain financial and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Financial and economic conditions continue to be uncertain over the longer term and the continuation or worsening of such conditions could reduce consumer confidence and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. If consumer confidence were to decline, this decline could negatively affect our advertising customers’ businesses and their advertising budgets. In addition, volatile economic conditions could have a negative impact on our industry or the industries of our customers who advertise on our stations, resulting in reduced advertising sales. Furthermore, it may be possible that actions taken by any governmental or regulatory body for the purpose of stabilizing the economy or financial markets will not achieve their intended effect. In addition to any negative direct consequences to our business or results of operations arising from these financial and economic developments, some of these actions may adversely affect financial institutions, capital providers, advertisers or other consumers on whom we rely, including for access to future capital or financing arrangements necessary to support our business. Our inability to obtain financing in amounts and at times necessary could make it more difficult or impossible to meet our obligations or otherwise take actions in our best interests.  22  Our dependence upon a limited number of advertising categories could adversely affect our  business. We consider broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned primarily from the sale of advertisements broadcast by our stations. Although no single customer represented more than 5% of our broadcast advertising revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2015, we derived a material portion of non-political broadcast advertising revenue from advertisers in a limited number of industries, particularly the automotive industry. For each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, we derived approximately 22% and 24% of our total broadcast advertising revenue from our advertisers in the automotive industry. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if broadcast advertising revenue from the automotive, or certain other industries, such as the medical, restaurant, communications, or furniture and appliances, industries, declined. In addition, in even-numbered years, we typically derive a material portion of our broadcast advertising revenue from political broadcast advertisers, as described above. If political broadcast advertising revenue declined, especially in an even-numbered year, our results of operations and financial condition could also be materially adversely affected. We intend to continue to evaluate growth opportunities through strategic acquisitions, and there are significant risks associated with an acquisition strategy. We intend to continue to evaluate opportunities for growth through selective acquisitions of television stations or station groups. There can be no assurances that we will be able to identify any suitable acquisition candidates, and we cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing or completing any acquisitions, or what the consequences of not completing any acquisitions would be. Consummation of any proposed acquisition at any time may also be subject to various conditions such as compliance with FCC rules and policies. Consummation of acquisitions may also be subject to antitrust or other regulatory requirements.  An acquisition strategy involves numerous other risks, including risks associated with:  ●identifying suitable acquisition candidates and negotiating definitive purchase agreements on satisfactory terms;  ●integrating operations and systems and managing a large and geographically diverse group of stations;  ●obtaining financing to complete acquisitions, which financing may not be available to us at times, in amounts, or at rates acceptable to us, if at all, and potentially the related risks associated with increased debt;  ●diverting our management’s attention from other business concerns;  ●potentially losing key employees at acquired stations; and  ●potential changes in the regulatory approval process that may make it materially more expensive, or materially delay our ability, to consummate any proposed acquisitions. Our failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates, or to complete any acquisitions and integrate any acquired business, or to obtain the expected benefits therefrom, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  23  We may fail to realize any benefits and incur unanticipated losses related to any acquisition. The success of any strategic acquisition depends, in part, on our ability to successfully combine the acquired business and assets with our business and our ability to successfully manage the assets so acquired. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Successful integration may also be hampered by any differences between the operations and corporate culture of the two organizations. Additionally, general market and economic conditions may inhibit our successful integration of any business. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Finally, any cost savings that are realized may be offset by losses in revenues from the acquired business, any assets or operations disposed of in connection therewith or otherwise, or charges to earnings in connection with such acquisitions. We must purchase television programming in advance of knowing whether a particular show will be popular enough for us to recoup our costs. One of our most significant costs is for the purchase of television programming. If a particular program is not sufficiently popular among audiences in relation to the cost we pay for such program, we may not be able to sell enough related advertising time for us to recoup the costs we pay to broadcast the program. We also must usually purchase programming several years in advance, and we may have to commit to purchase more than one year’s worth of programming, resulting in the incurrence of significant costs in advance of our receipt of any related revenue. We may also replace programs that are performing poorly before we have recaptured any significant portion of the costs we incurred in obtaining such programming or fully expensed the costs for financial reporting purposes. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues, result in the incurrence of impairment charges or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues. We are highly dependent upon our network affiliations, and our business and results of operations may be materially affected if a network (i) terminates its affiliation with us, (ii) significantly changes the economic terms and conditions of any future affiliation agreements with us or (iii) significantly changes the type, quality or quantity of programming provided to us under an affiliation agreement. Our business depends in large part on the success of our network affiliations. Nearly all of our stations are directly or indirectly affiliated with at least one of the four major broadcast networks pursuant to a separate affiliation agreement. Each affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the affiliated network during the term of the related agreement. Our affiliation agreements generally expire at various dates through August 2022. If we cannot enter into affiliation agreements to replace any agreements in advance of their expiration, we would no longer be able to carry the affiliated network’s programming. This loss of programming would require us to seek to obtain replacement programming. Such replacement programming may involve higher costs and may not be as attractive to our target audiences, thereby reducing our ability to generate advertising revenue. Furthermore, our concentration of CBS and/or NBC affiliates makes us particularly sensitive to adverse changes in our business relationship with, and the general success of, CBS and/or NBC. We can give no assurance that any future affiliation agreements will have economic terms or conditions equivalent to or more advantageous to us than our current agreements. If in the future a network or networks imposed more adverse economic terms upon us, such event or events could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  24  In addition, if we are unable to renew or replace any existing affiliation agreements, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations under our existing or any future retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs and/or secure payment of retransmission consent fees under such agreements. Furthermore, if in the future a network limited or removed our ability to retransmit network programming to MVPDs, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations or criteria for fees under any existing or any future retransmission consent agreements. In either case, such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are also dependent upon our retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs, and we cannot predict the outcome of potential regulatory changes to the retransmission consent regime. We are also dependent, in significant part, on our retransmission consent agreements. Our current retransmission consent agreements expire at various times over the next several years. No assurances can be provided that we will be able to renegotiate all of such agreements on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. The failure to renegotiate such agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our ability to successfully negotiate future retransmission consent agreements may be hindered by potential legislative or regulatory charges to the framework under which these agreements are negotiated. For example, on March 31, 2014, the FCC amended its rules governing “good faith” retransmission consent negotiations to provide that it is a per se violation of the statutory duty to negotiate in good faith for a television broadcast station that is ranked among the top-four stations in a market (as measured by audience share) to negotiate retransmission consent jointly with another top-four station in the same market if the stations are not commonly owned. As part of the STELA Reauthorization Act of 2014 (“STELAR”), Congress further tightened the restriction to prohibit joint negotiation with any television station in the same market unless the stations are under common de jure control. We currently are not a party to any agreements that delegate our authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any of our television stations or grant us authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any other television station. Nevertheless, we cannot predict how this restriction might impact future opportunities. The FCC also has sought comment on whether it should modify or eliminate the network non- duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. If, however, the FCC eliminates or relaxes its rules enforcing our program exclusivity rights, it could affect our ability to negotiate future retransmission consent agreements, and it could harm our ratings and advertising revenue if cable and satellite operators import duplicative programming. In addition, certain online video distributors (“OVDs”) have explored streaming broadcast programming over the internet without approval from or payments to the broadcaster. The majority of federal courts have issued preliminary injunctions enjoining these OVDs from streaming broadcast programming because the courts have generally concluded that OVDs are unlikely to demonstrate that they are eligible for the statutory copyright license that provides cable operators with the requisite copyrights to retransmit broadcast programming, although in July 2015 a district court concluded that OVDs should be eligible for the statutory copyright license. That case currently is on appeal. We cannot predict the outcome of that appeal or whether the courts will continue to issue similar injunctions against future OVDs. Separately, on December 19, 2014, the FCC issued an NPRM proposing to classify certain OVDs as MVPDs for purposes of certain FCC carriage rules. If the FCC adopts its proposal, OVDs would need to negotiate for consent from broadcasters before they retransmit broadcast signals. We cannot predict whether the FCC will adopt its proposal or other modified rules that might weaken our rights to negotiate with OVDs.  25  In September 2015, the FCC, in accordance with STELAR, issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to review the “totality of the circumstances test” used to evaluate whether broadcast stations and MVPDs are negotiating for retransmission consent in good faith. In a July 14, 2016 blog post, the Chairman of the FCC announced that the FCC will not be adopting additional rules governing the retransmission consent process as a part of this proceeding. Instead, the FCC will monitor retransmission consent negotiations and rule on good-faith-negotiation complaints on a case-by-case basis. We cannot predict whether this approach will affect our ability to negotiate retransmission consent agreements, including the rates that we obtain from MVPDs, nor can we predict whether the FCC might reopen this proceeding in the future. The FCC also has taken other actions to implement various provisions of STELAR affecting the carriage of television stations, including (i) adopting rules that allow for the modification of satellite television markets in order to ensure that satellite operators carry the broadcast stations of most interest to their communities, (ii) prohibiting a television station from limiting the ability of an MVPD to carry into its local market television signals that are deemed significantly viewed; and (iii) eliminating the “sweeps prohibition,” which had precluded cable operators from deleting or repositioning local commercial television stations during “sweeps” ratings periods. Congress also continues to consider various changes to the statutory scheme governing retransmission of broadcast programming. Some of the proposed bills would make it more difficult to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with large MVPDs and would weaken our leverage to seek market-based compensation for our programming. We cannot predict whether any of these proposals will become law, and, if any do, we cannot determine the effect that any statutory changes would have on our business. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Competition occurs on multiple levels (for audiences, programming and advertisers) and is based on a variety of factors. If we are not able to successfully compete in all relevant aspects, our revenues will be materially adversely affected. Television stations compete for audiences, certain programming (including news) and advertisers. Signal coverage and carriage on MVPD systems also materially affect a television station’s competitive position. With respect to audiences, stations compete primarily based on broadcast program popularity. We cannot provide any assurances as to the acceptability by audiences of any of the programs we broadcast. Further, because we compete with other broadcast stations for certain programming, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain any desired programming at costs that we believe are reasonable. Cable-network programming, combined with increased access to cable and satellite TV, has become a significant competitor for broadcast television programming viewers. Cable networks’ viewership and advertising share have increased due to the growth in MVPD penetration (the percentage of television households that are connected to a MVPD system) and increased investments in programming by cable networks. Further increases in the advertising share of cable networks could materially adversely affect the advertising revenue of our television stations. In addition, technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of programming alternatives, such as internet websites, mobile apps and wireless carriers, direct-to-consumer video distribution systems, and home entertainment systems have further fractionalized television viewing audiences and resulted in additional challenges to revenue generation. New technologies and methods of buying advertising also present an additional competitive challenge, as competitors may offer products and services such as the ability to purchase advertising programmatically or bundled offline and online advertising, aimed at more efficiently capturing advertising spend. Our inability or failure to broadcast popular programs, or otherwise maintain viewership for any reason, including as a result of increases in programming alternatives, or our loss of advertising due to technological changes, could result in a lack of advertisers, or a reduction in the amount advertisers are willing to pay us to advertise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  26  Our pension plan obligations are currently underfunded, and, if certain factors worsen, we may have to make significant cash payments to some or all of these plans, which could reduce the cash available for our business. We have underfunded obligations under our defined benefit pension plan. Notwithstanding that our pension plan is frozen with regard to any future benefit accruals, the funded status of our pension plan is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of certain market interest rates and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations. Unfavorable returns on the plan’s assets or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations may materially change the timing and amount of required plan funding, which could reduce the cash available for our business. In addition, any future decreases in the discount rate used to determine pension obligations could result in an increase in the valuation of pension obligations, which could affect the reported funding status of our pension plan and future contributions. We may be unable to maintain or increase our internet advertising revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. We generate a portion of our advertising revenue from the sale of advertisements on our internet sites. Our ability to maintain and increase this advertising revenue is largely dependent upon the number of users actively visiting our internet sites. As a result, we must increase user engagement with our internet sites in order to increase our advertising revenue. Because internet advertising techniques are evolving, if our technology and advertisement serving techniques do not evolve to meet the changing needs of advertisers, our advertising revenue could also decline. Changes in our business model, advertising inventory or initiatives could also cause a decrease in our internet advertising revenue. We do not have long-term agreements with most of our internet advertisers. Any termination, change or decrease in our relationships with our largest advertising clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. If we do not maintain or increase our advertising revenue, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We have, in the past, incurred impairment charges on our goodwill and/or broadcast licenses, and any such future charges may have a material effect on the value of our total assets. As of December 31, 2016, the book value of our broadcast licenses was $1.3 billion and the book value of our goodwill was $485.3 million, in comparison to total assets of $2.8 billion. Not less than annually, and more frequently if necessary, we are required to evaluate our goodwill and broadcast licenses to determine if the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value. If the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value, we will be required to record a non-cash expense to write down the book value of the intangible asset to the estimated fair value. We cannot make any assurances that any required impairment charges will not have a material adverse effect on our total assets. Cybersecurity risks could affect our operating effectiveness. We use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. Our revenues are increasingly dependent on digital products. Such use exposes us to potential cyber incidents resulting from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents could include, but are not limited to, unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, data corruption or operational disruption. The results of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, business interruption, disclosure of nonpublic information, decreased advertising revenues, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation, financial consequences and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence, any or all of which could adversely affect our business. Although we have systems and processes in place to protect against risks associated with cyber incidents, depending on the nature of an incident, these protections may not be fully sufficient.  27   Certain stockholders or groups of stockholders have the ability to exert significant influence over us. Hilton H. Howell, Jr., our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, is the son-in-law of Mrs. Harriett J. Robinson, a member of our Board of Directors, as well as the husband of Mrs. Robin R. Howell, a member of our Board of Directors (collectively with members of their family, the “Howell-Robinson Family”). As of February 21, 2017, collectively, the Howell-Robinson Family directly or indirectly beneficially owned shares representing approximately 43% of the outstanding combined voting power of our common stock and Class A common stock. As a result of these significant stockholdings and positions on the Board of Directors, the Howell- Robinson Family is able to exert significant influence over our policies and management, potentially in a manner that may not be consistent with the interests of our other stockholders. We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations and we depend on our subsidiaries for cash. We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations, other than our investments in our subsidiaries. Because we are a holding company, we are dependent upon the payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. These payments could be or become subject to dividend or other restrictions under applicable laws in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. Payments by our subsidiaries are also contingent upon the subsidiaries’ earnings. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our financial condition and ability to meet our obligations may be adversely affected. Risks Related to Regulatory Matters Federal broadcasting industry regulations limit our operating flexibility. The FCC regulates all television broadcasters, including us. We must obtain FCC approval whenever we (i) apply for a new license, (ii) seek to renew, modify or assign a license, (iii) purchase a broadcast station and/or (iv) transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries that holds a license. Our FCC licenses are critical to our operations, and we cannot operate without them. We cannot be certain that the FCC will renew these licenses in the future or approve new acquisitions, mergers, divestitures or other business activities. Our failure to renew any licenses upon the expiration of any license term could have a material adverse effect on our business. Federal legislation and FCC rules have changed significantly in recent years and may continue to change. These changes may limit our ability to conduct our business in ways that we believe would be advantageous and may affect our operating results. The FCC can sanction us for programming broadcast on our stations that it finds to be indecent. Over the past several years, the FCC has increased its enforcement efforts regarding broadcast indecency and profanity and the statutory maximum fine for broadcasting indecent material is currently $325,000 per incident. In June 2012, the Supreme Court decided a challenge to the FCC’s indecency enforcement without resolving the scope of the FCC’s ability to regulate broadcast content. In August 2013, the FCC issued a Public Notice seeking comment on whether it should modify its indecency policies. The FCC has not yet issued a decision in this proceeding and the courts remain free to review the FCC’s current policy or any modifications thereto. The outcomes of these proceedings could affect future FCC policies in this area, and we are unable to predict the outcome of any such judicial proceeding, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  28  The FCC’s duopoly restrictions limit our ability to own and operate multiple television stations in the same market. The FCC’s ownership rules generally prohibit us from owning or having “attributable interests” in two television stations that are located in the same markets in which our stations are licensed and are ranked among the top-four stations in the market. On August 25, 2016, the FCC released an Order (“Quadrennial Order”) in which it decided to retain, with only a minor technical modification, its duopoly restrictions. In that Order, the FCC also reinstated its previous decision to consider television Joint Sales Agreements (“JSAs”) (which are agreements under which a television station sells more than 15 percent of the weekly advertising time on another same-market television station) as “attributable interests.” The National Association of Broadcasters has filed an appeal challenging the Quadrennial Order. The FCC also considers television Local Marketing Agreements (“LMAs”) (which are agreements under which a television station sells or provides more than 15 percent of the programming on another same-market television station) as “attributable interests.” Accordingly, those rules constrain our ability to expand in our present markets through additional station acquisitions, JSAs, or LMAs. The FCC’s National Television Station Ownership Rule limits the maximum number of households we can reach. Under the FCC’s National Television Station Ownership Rule, a single television station owner may not reach more than 39 percent of U.S. households through commonly owned television stations, subject to a 50 percent discount of the number of television households attributable to UHF stations (the “UHF Discount”). In September 2016, the FCC adopted an Order that eliminated the UHF Discount but grandfathered existing combinations that exceed the 39 percent cap. A Petition for Reconsideration of this rule change is pending. This rule may constrain our ability to expand through additional station acquisitions. The FCC’s Incentive Auction and related proceedings could result in the reallocation of broadcast spectrum for wireless broadband or other non-broadcast use, which could materially impair our ability to provide competitive services. In February 2012, Congress passed legislation that grants the FCC authority to conduct an auction of certain spectrum currently used by television broadcasters. On May 15, 2014, the FCC adopted a Report and Order (the “2014 Report”) establishing the framework for an incentive auction of broadcast television spectrum. The 2014 Report created a two part incentive auction framework (the “Incentive Auction”). First, the FCC would conduct a reverse auction by which a television broadcaster may volunteer, in return for payment, to relinquish all or a part of its station’s spectrum by (i) surrendering its license, (ii) relinquishing a portion of its spectrum and thereafter sharing spectrum with another station, or (iii) modifying a UHF channel license to a VHF channel license. Second, the FCC would conduct a forward auction of the relinquished spectrum to new users. Applications to participate in the Incentive Auction were due by January 12, 2016 and bidding in the reverse broadcast auction began on March 29, 2016. Broadcaster bidding in the reverse auction closed on January 13, 2017. Bidding in the forward auction remains ongoing but is anticipated to end in the first half of 2017.  29  When the bidding in the forward auction closes, the FCC will begin the process of repurposing 84 MHz of broadcast spectrum for wireless use. To accommodate the spectrum reallocation to new users, the FCC may require that television stations that did not sell their stations in the reverse auction to modify their transmission facilities. The FCC is required to use “reasonable efforts” to preserve a station’s coverage area and population served, and it prevents the FCC from requiring that a station involuntarily move from the UHF band to the VHF band or from the high VHF band to the low VHF band. The underlying legislation authorizes the FCC to reimburse stations for reasonable relocation costs up to a total across all stations of $1.75 billion. If some or all of our television stations choose to channel share or are required to change frequencies they use, our stations could incur conversion costs that may not be fully reimbursed, or our ability to provide high definition programming and additional program streams, including mobile video services, could be constrained. The FCC interpreted the implementing legislation to allow only full power and Class A television stations to participate in the auction and receive contour protection during any post-auction repacking of the broadcast spectrum. In certain markets, our low power television stations may be displaced by this process. Moreover, on June 16, 2015, the FCC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to reserve one vacant channel in each market for use by unlicensed “white spaces” devices and wireless microphones (the “Vacant Channel NPRM”). The FCC further modified the Vacant Channel NPRM on August 11, 2015 by proposing to reserve up to two channels in certain markets after the Incentive Auction is complete. Under the Vacant Channel NPRM, the FCC would refuse to grant an application to modify the facilities of a low power television station if the applicant could not demonstrate that a sufficient number of vacant channels would remain in the service area of the low power station after the applicant implements the modification – thus, reducing the likelihood that a low power television station would be able to locate a new channel after the Incentive Auction. These stations could incur substantial costs to locate and build a replacement facility on a new channel. If a low power television station is unable to locate a new channel on which to operate, it could lose its license. We cannot predict the likelihood, timing or outcome of any court, Congressional or FCC regulatory action with respect to the Incentive Auction, or repacking of broadcast television spectrum, nor the impact of any such changes upon our business. "
3,GTN,GRAY TELEVISION INC,2016-02-26,"Risk Factors
. In addition to the other information contained in, incorporated by reference into or otherwise referred to in this report, you should consider carefully the following factors when evaluating our business. Any of these risks, or the occurrence of any of the events described in these risk factors, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently do not deem material could arise, any of which could also materially adversely affect us. This report also contains and incorporates by reference forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the occurrence of one or more of the following risk factors.   We have substantial debt and have the ability to incur significant additional debt. The principal and interest payment obligations on such debt may restrict our future operations and impair our ability to meet our long-term obligations. At December 31, 2015, we had approximately $1.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness (excluding intercompany debt). On February 16, 2016, we incurred an additional $425.0 million of debt (the “2016 Term Loan”) under our senior credit facility (the “Senior Credit Facility”). Proceeds from borrowings under the 2016 Term Loan were used to fund the cash purchase price to complete the Schurz Acquisition and Related Transactions and to pay a portion of the related fees and expenses. Subject to our ability to meet certain borrowing conditions, we have the ability to incur significant additional debt, including secured debt, under our Senior Credit Facility, including but not limited to our un-drawn $60.0 million revolving loan. In addition, the terms of the indenture governing our outstanding 7½% Senior Notes due 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) (as supplemented, the “Indenture”) also permit us to incur additional indebtedness, subject to our ability to meet certain borrowing conditions.  19   Our substantial debt may have important consequences. For instance, it could:  ●require us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt, which would reduce funds available for other business purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions;  ●place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors that may have less debt and better access to capital resources;   ●limit our ability to obtain additional financing required to fund acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes; and  ●make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations. Our ability to service our significant financial obligations depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow. This is partially subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, that future borrowings will be available to us under the Senior Credit Facility or any other credit facilities, or that we will be able to complete any necessary financings, in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our operations or pay our debts and other obligations, or to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts, at times or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Specifically, volatility in the capital markets may also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, or to refinance our existing debt, on terms or at times favorable to us. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to service our debt or other obligations, which could result in us being in default thereon, in which circumstances our lenders could cease making loans to us, and lenders or other holders of our debt could accelerate and declare due all outstanding obligations due under the respective agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on us.  The agreements governing our various debt obligations impose restrictions on our operations and limit our ability to undertake certain corporate actions. The agreements governing our various debt obligations, including the Indenture and the agreements governing the Senior Credit Facility, include covenants imposing significant restrictions on our operations. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These covenants place restrictions on our ability to, among other things:  ●incur additional debt, subject to certain limitations;  ●declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders;  ●make investments or acquisitions;    20   ●create liens or use assets as security in other transactions;  ●issue guarantees;  ●merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets;  ●amend our articles of incorporation or bylaws;  ●engage in transactions with affiliates; and  ●purchase, sell or transfer certain assets. Any of these restrictions and limitations could make it more difficult for us to execute our business strategy. The Indenture and the Senior Credit Facility also require us to comply with certain financial ratios and covenants; our failure to do so would result in a default thereunder, which would have a material adverse effect on us. We are also required to comply with certain financial covenants under the Indenture and the Senior Credit Facility. Our ability to comply with these requirements may be affected by events affecting our business, but beyond our control, including prevailing general economic, financial and industry conditions. These covenants could have an adverse effect on us by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition or other corporate opportunities. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the Indenture or the Senior Credit Facility.  Upon a default under any of our debt agreements, the lenders or debt holders thereunder could have the right to declare all amounts outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable, which could, in turn, trigger defaults under other debt obligations and could result in the termination of commitments of the lenders to make further extensions of credit under the Senior Credit Facility. If we were unable to repay our secured debt to our lenders, or were otherwise in default under any provision governing our outstanding secured debt obligations, our secured lenders could proceed against us and the subsidiary guarantors and against the collateral securing that debt. Any default resulting in an acceleration of outstanding indebtedness, a termination of commitments under our financing arrangements or lenders proceeding against the collateral securing such indebtedness would likely result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly. Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) were to exceed certain levels, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available to service our obligations would decrease.  21   The success of our business is dependent upon advertising revenues, which are seasonal and cyclical, and will also fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our main source of revenue is the sale of advertising time and space. Our ability to sell advertising time and space depends on, among other things:  ●economic conditions in the areas where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole;  ●the popularity of the programming offered by our television stations;  ●changes in the population demographics in the areas where our stations are located;  ●local and national advertising price fluctuations, which can be affected by the availability of programming, the popularity of programming, and the relative supply of and demand for commercial advertising;  ●our competitors’ activities, including increased competition from other advertising-based mediums, particularly cable networks, MVPDs and the internet;  ●the duration and extent of any network preemption of regularly scheduled programming for any reason;  ●decisions by advertisers to withdraw or delay planned advertising expenditures for any reason;  ●labor disputes or other disruptions at major national advertisers, programming providers or networks; and  ●other factors beyond our control. Our results are also subject to seasonal and cyclical fluctuations that we expect to continue. Seasonal fluctuations typically result in higher revenue and broadcast operating income in the second and fourth quarters than in the first and third quarters of each year. This seasonality is primarily attributable to advertisers’ increased expenditures in the spring and in anticipation of holiday season spending in the fourth quarter and an increase in television viewership during this period. In addition, we typically experience fluctuations in our revenue and broadcast operating income between even-numbered and odd-numbered years. In years in which there are impending elections for various state and national offices, which primarily occur in even-numbered years, political advertising revenue tends to increase, often significantly, and particularly during presidential election years. We consider political broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned from the sale to political candidates, political parties and special interest groups of advertisements broadcast by our stations that contain messages primarily focused on elections and/or public policy issues. In even-numbered years, we derive a material portion of our broadcast advertising revenue from political broadcast advertisers. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we derived approximately 3% and 16%, respectively, of our total revenue from political broadcast advertisers. If political broadcast advertising revenue declined, especially in an even-numbered year, our results of operations and financial condition could also be materially adversely affected. Also, our stations affiliated with the NBC Network broadcast Olympic Games typically experience increased viewership and revenue during those broadcasts, which also occurs in even-numbered years. As a result of the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenue and broadcast operating income, and the historically significant increase in our revenue and broadcast operating income during even-numbered years, it has been, and is expected to remain, difficult to engage in period-over-period comparisons of our revenue and results of operations. Continued uncertain financial and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Financial and economic conditions continue to be uncertain over the longer term and the continuation or worsening of such conditions could reduce consumer confidence and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. If consumer confidence were to decline, this decline could negatively affect our advertising customers’ businesses and their advertising budgets. In addition, volatile economic conditions could have a negative impact on our industry or the industries of our customers who advertise on our stations, resulting in reduced advertising sales. Furthermore, it may be possible that actions taken by any governmental or regulatory body for the purpose of stabilizing the economy or financial markets will not achieve their intended effect. In addition to any negative direct consequences to our business or results of operations arising from these financial and economic developments, some of these actions may adversely affect financial institutions, capital providers, advertisers or other consumers on whom we rely, including for access to future capital or financing arrangements necessary to support our business. Our inability to obtain financing in amounts and at times necessary could make it more difficult or impossible to meet our obligations or otherwise take actions in our best interests.  22   Our dependence upon a limited number of advertising categories could adversely affect our business. We consider broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned primarily from the sale of advertisements broadcast by our stations. Although no single customer represented more than 5% of our broadcast advertising revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 or 2014, we derived a material portion of non-political broadcast advertising revenue from advertisers in a limited number of industries, particularly the automotive industry. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we derived approximately 24% and 21%, respectively, of our total broadcast advertising revenue from our advertisers in the automotive industry. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if broadcast advertising revenue from the automotive, or certain other industries, such as the medical, restaurant, communications, or furniture and appliances industries, declined. In addition, in even-numbered years, we derive a material portion of our broadcast advertising revenue from political broadcast advertisers as described above. If political broadcast advertising revenue declined, especially in an even-numbered year, our results of operations and financial condition could also be materially adversely affected. We seek to selectively evaluate growth opportunities through strategic acquisitions, and there are significant risks associated with an acquisition strategy. We intend to continue to evaluate opportunities for growth through selective acquisitions of television stations or station groups. There can be no assurances that we will be able to identify any suitable acquisition candidates, and we cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing or completing any acquisitions, or what the consequences of not completing any acquisitions would be. Consummation of any proposed acquisition at any time may also be subject to various conditions such as compliance with FCC rules and policies. Consummation of acquisitions may also be subject to antitrust or other regulatory requirements. An acquisition strategy involves numerous other risks, which includes risks associated with:  ●identifying suitable acquisition candidates and negotiating definitive purchase agreements on satisfactory terms;  ●integrating operations and systems and managing a large and geographically diverse group of stations;  ●obtaining financing to complete acquisitions, which financing may not be available to us at times, in amounts, or at rates acceptable to us, if at all, and potentially the related risks associated with increased debt;    23   ●diverting our management’s attention from other business concerns;  ●potentially losing key employees at acquired stations; and  ●potential changes in the regulatory approval process that may make it materially more expensive, or materially delay our ability, to consummate any proposed acquisitions.  Our failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates, or to complete any acquisitions and integrate any acquired business, or to obtain the expected benefits therefrom, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may fail to realize any benefits and incur unanticipated losses related to any acquisition.  The success of our strategic acquisitions depends, in part, on our ability to successfully combine the acquired business and assets with our business and our ability to successfully manage the assets so acquired. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Successful integration may also be hampered by any differences between the operations and corporate culture of the two organizations. Additionally, general market and economic conditions may inhibit our successful integration of any business. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Finally, any cost savings that are realized may be offset by losses in revenues from the acquired business, any assets or operations disposed of in connection therewith or otherwise, or charges to earnings in connection with such acquisitions. We must purchase television programming in advance of knowing whether a particular show will be popular enough for us to recoup our costs. One of our most significant costs is for the purchase of television programming. If a particular program is not sufficiently popular among audiences in relation to the cost we pay for such program, we may not be able to sell enough related advertising time for us to recoup the costs we pay to broadcast the program. We also must usually purchase programming several years in advance, and we may have to commit to purchase more than one year’s worth of programming, resulting in the incurrence of significant costs in advance of our receipt of any related revenue. We may also replace programs that are performing poorly before we have recaptured any significant portion of the costs we incurred in obtaining such programming or fully expensed the costs for financial reporting purposes. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues, result in the incurrence of impairment charges or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues. We are highly dependent upon our network affiliations, and our business and results of operations may be materially affected if a network (i) terminates its affiliation with us; (ii) significantly changes the economic terms and conditions of any future affiliation agreements with us; or (iii) significantly changes the type, quality or quantity of programming provided to us under an affiliation agreement. Our business depends in large part on the success of our network affiliations. Nearly all of our stations are directly or indirectly affiliated with at least one of the four major broadcast networks pursuant to a separate affiliation agreement. Each affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the affiliated network during the term of the related agreement. Our affiliation agreements generally expire at various dates through December 2020.  24   If we cannot enter into affiliation agreements to replace any agreements in advance of their expiration, we would no longer be able to carry the affiliated network’s programming. This loss of programming would require us to seek to obtain replacement programming. Such replacement programming may involve higher costs and may not be as attractive to our target audiences, thereby reducing our ability to generate advertising revenue. Furthermore, our concentration of CBS and/or NBC affiliates makes us particularly sensitive to adverse changes in our business relationship with, and the general success of, CBS and/or NBC.  We can give no assurance that any future affiliation agreements will have economic terms or conditions equivalent to or more advantageous to us than our current agreements. If in the future a network or networks imposed more adverse economic terms upon us, such event or events could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, if we are unable to renew or replace any existing affiliation agreements, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations under our existing or any future retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs and/or secure payment of retransmission consent fees under such agreements. Furthermore, if in the future a network limited or removed our ability to retransmit network programming to MVPDs, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations or criteria for fees under any existing or any future retransmission consent agreements. In either case, such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are also dependent upon our retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs, and we cannot predict the outcome of potential regulatory changes to the retransmission consent regime.  We are also dependent, in significant part, on our retransmission consent agreements. Our current retransmission consent agreements expire at various times over the next several years. No assurances can be provided that we will be able to renegotiate all of such agreements on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. The failure to renegotiate such agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our ability to successfully negotiate future retransmission consent agreements may be hindered by potential legislative or regulatory charges to the framework under which these agreements are negotiated.  For example, on March 31, 2014, the FCC amended its rules governing “good faith” retransmission consent negotiations to provide that it is a per se violation of the statutory duty to negotiate in good faith for a television broadcast station that is ranked among the top-four stations in a market (as measured by audience share) to negotiate retransmission consent jointly with another top-four station in the same market if the stations are not commonly owned. As part of the STELAR, Congress further tightened the restriction to prohibit joint negotiation with any television station in the same market unless the stations are under common de jure control. We currently are not a party to any agreements that delegate our authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any of our television stations or grant us authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any other television station. Nevertheless, we cannot predict how this restriction might impact future opportunities.  The FCC also has sought comment on whether it should modify or eliminate the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. If, however, the FCC eliminates or relaxes its rules enforcing our program exclusivity rights, it could affect our ability to negotiate future retransmission consent agreements, and it could harm our ratings and advertising revenue if cable and satellite operators import duplicative programming.   25   In addition, certain online video distributors (“OVDs”) have explored streaming broadcast programming over the internet without approval from or payments to the broadcaster. The majority of federal courts have issued preliminary injunctions enjoining these OVDs from streaming broadcast programming because the courts have generally concluded that OVDs are unlikely to demonstrate that they are eligible for the statutory copyright license that provides cable operators with the requisite copyrights to retransmit broadcast programming, although in July 2015 a district court concluded that OVDs should be eligible for the statutory copyright license. That case currently is on appeal. We cannot predict the outcome of that appeal or whether the courts will continue to issue similar injunctions against future OVDs. Separately, on December 19, 2014, the FCC issued an NPRM proposing to classify certain OVDs as MVPDs for purposes of certain FCC carriage rules. If the FCC adopts its proposal, OVDs would need to negotiate for consent from broadcasters before they retransmit broadcast signals. We cannot predict whether the FCC will adopt its proposal or other modified rules that might weaken our rights to negotiate with OVDs. In September 2015, the FCC, in accordance with STELAR, issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to review the “totality of the circumstances test” used to evaluate whether broadcast stations and MVPDs are negotiating for retransmission consent in good faith. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.  If, however, the FCC revises the totality of the circumstances test, it could affect our ability to negotiate retransmission consent agreements, including the rates that we obtain from MVPDs. The FCC also has taken other actions to implement various provisions of STELAR affecting the carriage of television stations, including (i) adopting rules that allow for the modification of satellite television markets in order to ensure that satellite operators carry the broadcast stations of most interest to their communities, (ii) prohibiting same-market television stations from coordinating negotiations or negotiating on a joint basis for retransmission consent, except under certain conditions, (iii) prohibiting a television station from limiting the ability of an MVPD to carry into its local market television signals that are deemed significantly viewed; and (iv) eliminating the “sweeps prohibition,” which had precluded cable operators from deleting or repositioning local commercial television stations during “sweeps” ratings periods. Congress also continues to consider various changes to the statutory scheme governing retransmission of broadcast programming. Some of the proposed bills would make it more difficult to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with large MVPDs and would weaken our leverage to seek market-based compensation for our programming. We cannot predict whether any of these proposals will become law, and, if any do, we cannot determine the effect that any statutory changes would have on our business. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Competition occurs on multiple levels (for audiences, programming and advertisers) and is based on a variety of factors. If we are not able to successfully compete in all relevant aspects, our revenues will be materially adversely affected. Television stations compete for audiences, certain programming (including news) and advertisers. Signal coverage and carriage on MVPD systems also materially affect a television station’s competitive position. With respect to audiences, stations compete primarily based on broadcast program popularity. We cannot provide any assurances as to the acceptability by audiences of any of the programs we broadcast. Further, because we compete with other broadcast stations for certain programming, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain any desired programming at costs that we believe are reasonable. Cable-network programming combined with increased access to cable and satellite TV, has become a significant competitor for broadcast television programming viewers. Cable networks’ viewership and advertising share have increased due to the growth in MVPD penetration (the percentage of television households that are connected to a MVPD system) and increased investments in programming by cable networks. Further increases in the advertising share of cable networks could materially adversely affect the advertising revenue of our television stations.  26   In addition, technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of programming alternatives, such as internet websites, mobile apps and wireless carriers, direct-to-consumer video distribution systems, and home entertainment systems have further fractionalized television viewing audiences and resulted in additional challenges to revenue generation. New technologies and methods of buying advertising also present an additional competitive challenge, as competitors may offer products and services such as the ability to purchase advertising programmatically or bundled offline and online advertising, aimed at more efficiently capturing advertising spend. Our inability or failure to broadcast popular programs, or otherwise maintain viewership for any reason, including as a result of increases in programming alternatives, or our loss of advertising due to technological changes, could result in a lack of advertisers, or a reduction in the amount advertisers are willing to pay us to advertise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our pension plan obligations are currently underfunded, and, if certain factors worsen, we may have to make significant cash payments to some or all of these plans, which could reduce the cash available for our business. We have underfunded obligations under our defined benefit pension plans. Notwithstanding that our pension plans are frozen with regard to any future benefit accruals, the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of certain market interest rates and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations. Unfavorable returns on the plan assets or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations may materially change the timing and amount of required plan funding, which could reduce the cash available for our business. In addition, any future decreases in the discount rate used to determine pension obligations could result in an increase in the valuation of pension obligations, which could affect the reported funding status of our pension plans and future contributions.  We do not currently pay cash dividends on either class of our common stock. To the extent a potential investor ascribes value to a dividend paying stock, the value of our stock may be correspondingly reduced. Our Board of Directors has not declared a cash or stock dividend on our common stock or Class A common stock since 2008. The timing and amount of any future dividend is at the discretion of our board of directors, and they may be subject to limitations or restrictions in the Senior Credit Facility and other financing agreements we may be, or become, party to. We can provide no assurance when or if any future dividends will be declared on either class of common stock. As a result, if and to the extent an investor ascribes value to a dividend-paying stock, the value of our common stock and Class A common stock may be correspondingly reduced. We may be unable to maintain or increase our internet advertising revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. We generate a portion of our advertising revenue from the sale of advertisements on our internet sites. Our ability to maintain and increase this advertising revenue is largely dependent upon the number of users actively visiting our internet sites. As a result we must increase user engagement with our internet sites in order to increase our advertising revenue. Because internet advertising techniques are evolving, if our technology and advertisement serving techniques do not evolve to meet the changing needs of advertisers, our advertising revenue could also decline. Changes in our business model, advertising inventory or initiatives could also cause a decrease in our internet advertising revenue.  27   We do not have long-term agreements with most of our internet advertisers. Any termination, change or decrease in our relationships with our largest advertising clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. If we do not maintain or increase our advertising revenue, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  We have, in the past, incurred impairment charges on our goodwill and/or broadcast licenses, and any such future charges may have a material effect on the value of our total assets. As of December 31, 2015, the book value of our broadcast licenses was $1.1 billion and the book value of our goodwill was $423.2 million, in comparison to total assets of $2.1 billion. Not less than annually, and more frequently if necessary, we are required to evaluate our goodwill and broadcast licenses to determine if the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value. If the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value, we will be required to record a non-cash expense to write down the book value of the intangible asset to the estimated fair value. We cannot make any assurances that any required impairment charges will not have a material adverse effect on our total assets.  Cybersecurity risks could affect our operating effectiveness. We use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. Our revenues are increasingly dependent on digital products. Such use exposes us to potential cyber incidents resulting from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents can include, but are not limited to, unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, data corruption or operational disruption. The results of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, business interruption, disclosure of nonpublic information, decreased advertising revenues, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation, financial consequences and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence, any or all of which could adversely affect our business. We have systems and processes in place to protect against risks associated with cyber incidents however, depending on the nature of an incident, these protections may not be fully sufficient. Certain stockholders or groups of stockholders have the ability to exert significant influence over us.  Hilton H. Howell, Jr., our Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, is the son-in-law of Mrs. Harriett J. Robinson, a member of our Board of Directors, as well as the husband of Mrs. Robin R. Howell, a member of our Board of Directors (collectively with members of their family, the “Howell-Robinson Family”). As of February 19, 2016, collectively, the Howell-Robinson Family directly or indirectly beneficially owns shares representing approximately 44.2% of the outstanding combined voting power of our common stock and Class A common stock.  As a result of these significant stockholdings and positions on the Board of Directors, the Howell-Robinson Family is able to exert significant influence over our policies and management, potentially in a manner that may not be consistent with the interests of our other stockholders. We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations and we depend on our subsidiaries for cash. We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations, other than our investments in our subsidiaries. Because we are a holding company, we are dependent upon the payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. These payments could be or become subject to dividend or other restrictions under applicable laws in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. Payments by our subsidiaries are also contingent upon the subsidiaries’ earnings. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our financial condition and ability to meet our obligations may be adversely affected.  28   Federal broadcasting industry regulations limit our operating flexibility. The FCC regulates all television broadcasters, including us. We must obtain FCC approval whenever we (i) apply for a new license; (ii) seek to renew, modify or assign a license; (iii) purchase a broadcast station; and/or (iv) transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries that holds a license. Our FCC licenses are critical to our operations, and we cannot operate without them. We cannot be certain that the FCC will renew these licenses in the future or approve new acquisitions, mergers, divestitures or other business activities. Our failure to renew any licenses upon the expiration of any license term could have a material adverse effect on our business. Federal legislation and FCC rules have changed significantly in recent years and may continue to change. These changes may limit our ability to conduct our business in ways that we believe would be advantageous and may affect our operating results. The FCC can sanction us for programming broadcast on our stations that it finds to be indecent. Over the past several years, the FCC has increased its enforcement efforts regarding broadcast indecency and profanity and the statutory maximum fine for broadcasting indecent material is currently $325,000 per incident. In June 2012, the Supreme Court decided a challenge to the FCC’s indecency enforcement without resolving the scope of the FCC’s ability to regulate broadcast content. In August 2013, the FCC issued a Public Notice seeking comment on whether it should modify its indecency policies. The FCC has not yet issued a decision in this proceeding, and the courts remain free to review the FCC’s current policy or any modifications thereto. The outcomes of these proceedings could affect future FCC policies in this area, and we are unable to predict the outcome of any such judicial proceeding, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The FCC’s duopoly restrictions limit our ability to own and operate multiple television stations in the same market. The FCC’s ownership rules generally prohibit us from owning or having “attributable interests” in television stations located in the same markets in which our stations are licensed. Accordingly, those rules constrain our ability to expand in our present markets through additional station acquisitions. The FCC’s National Television Station Ownership Rule limits the maximum number of households we can reach. Under the FCC’s National Television Station Ownership Rule, a single television station owner may not reach more than 39 percent of U.S. households through commonly owned television stations. This rule may constrain our ability to expand through additional station acquisitions. The FCC’s Incentive Auction and related proceedings could result in the reallocation of broadcast spectrum for wireless broadband or other non-broadcast use, which could materially impair our ability to provide competitive services. In February 2012, Congress passed legislation that, among other things, grants the FCC authority to conduct an auction of certain spectrum currently used by television broadcasters. On May 15, 2014, the FCC adopted the 2014 Report establishing the framework for implementation of the Incentive Auction of broadcast television spectrum. The 2014 Report created a two part Incentive Auction framework. First, the FCC would conduct a reverse auction by which a television broadcaster may volunteer, in return for payment, to relinquish all or a portion of its station’s spectrum by (i) surrendering its license, (ii) relinquishing part of its spectrum and thereafter sharing spectrum with another station, or (iii) modifying a UHF channel license to a VHF channel license. Second, the FCC would conduct a forward auction of the relinquished spectrum to new users. The FCC must complete the reverse auction and the forward auction by September 30, 2022. Applications to participate in the incentive auction were due by January 12, 2016 with bidding scheduled to begin on March 29, 2016. Completion of both parts of the Incentive Auction (reverse and forward) is expected to take up to one year.  29   To accommodate the spectrum reallocation to new users, the FCC may require that television stations that do not participate in the auction (or that participate but are not selected to sell their spectrum) modify their transmission facilities and change channels. The FCC is required to use “reasonable efforts” to preserve a station’s coverage area and population served, and the FCC is prohibited from requiring that a station involuntarily move from the UHF band to the VHF band or from the high VHF band to the low VHF band. The underlying legislation authorizes the FCC to reimburse stations for reasonable relocation costs up to a total across all stations of $1.75 billion. If some or all of our television stations choose to channel share or are required to change the frequencies they use, our stations could incur conversion costs that may not be fully reimbursed or our ability to provide high definition programming and additional program streams, including mobile video services, could be constrained.  The Incentive Auction and a related proceeding could have a material effect on our low power television stations. The FCC interpreted the implementing legislation to allow only full power and Class A television stations to participate in the auction and receive contour protection in any post-auction reorganization of the broadcast spectrum. In certain markets, our low power television stations may be displaced by this process. These stations could incur substantial costs to locate and build a replacement facility on a new channel. Moreover, on June 16, 2015, the FCC issued the Vacant Channel NPRM for proposed rulemaking to reserve one vacant channel in each market for use by unlicensed “white spaces” devices and wireless microphones. The FCC further modified the Vacant Channel NPRM on August 11, 2015 by proposing to reserve up to two channels in certain markets after the Incentive Auction is complete. Under the Vacant Channel NPRM, the FCC would refuse to grant an application to modify the facilities of a low power television station if the applicant could not demonstrate that a sufficient number of vacant channels would remain in the service area of the low power station after the applicant implements the modification – thus, reducing the likelihood that a low power television station would be able to locate a new channel after the Incentive Auction. If a low power television station is unable to locate a new channel on which to operate, it could lose its license. We cannot predict the likelihood, timing or outcome of any court, Congressional or FCC regulatory action with respect to the Incentive Auction, or repacking of broadcast television spectrum, nor the impact of any such changes upon our business. "
17,GTN,GRAY TELEVISION INC,2015-03-05,"  Risk Factors
. In addition to the other information contained in, incorporated by reference into or otherwise referred to in this report, you should consider carefully the following factors when evaluating our business. Any of these risks, or the occurrence of any of the events described in these risk factors, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently do not deem material could arise, any of which could also materially adversely affect us. This report also contains and incorporates by reference forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the occurrence of one or more of the following risk factors.   We have substantial debt and have the ability to incur significant additional debt. The principal and interest payment obligations on such debt may restrict our future operations and impair our ability to meet our long-term obligations. At December 31, 2014, we had approximately $1.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness (excluding intercompany indebtedness). We have the ability to incur significant additional debt, including secured debt, under our senior credit facility (the “2014 Senior Credit Facility”). In addition, the terms of the indenture governing our outstanding 7½% Senior Notes due 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) (as supplemented, the “indenture”) also permit us to incur additional indebtedness, subject to our ability to meet certain borrowing conditions.  19  Our substantial debt may have important consequences. For instance, it could:  ●require us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt, which would reduce funds available for other business purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions;  ●place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors that may have less debt and better access to capital resources;   ●limit our ability to obtain additional financing required to fund acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes; and  ●make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations. Our ability to service our significant financial obligations depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow. This is partially subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, that future borrowings will be available to us under the 2014 Senior Credit Facility or any other credit facilities, or that we will be able to complete any necessary financings, in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our operations or pay our debts and other obligations, or to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts, at times or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Specifically, volatility in the capital markets may also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, or to refinance our existing debt, on terms or at times favorable to us. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to service our debt or other obligations, which could result in us being in default thereon, in which circumstances our lenders could cease making loans to us, and lenders or other holders of our debt could accelerate and declare due all outstanding obligations due under the respective agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on us.  The agreements governing our various debt obligations impose restrictions on our operations and limit our ability to undertake certain corporate actions. The agreements governing our various debt obligations, including the indenture and the agreements governing the 2014 Senior Credit Facility, include covenants imposing significant restrictions on our operations. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These covenants place restrictions on our ability to, among other things:  ●incur additional debt, subject to certain limitations;  ●declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders;  ●make investments or acquisitions;  ●create liens or use assets as security in other transactions;  ●issue guarantees;  ●merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets;    20   ●amend our articles of incorporation or bylaws;  ●engage in transactions with affiliates; and  ●purchase, sell or transfer certain assets.  Any of these restrictions and limitations could make it more difficult for us to execute our business strategy. The indenture and the 2014 Senior Credit Facility also require us to comply with a number of financial ratios and covenants; our failure to do so would result in a default thereunder, which would have a material adverse effect on us. We are also required to comply with a number of financial covenants under the indenture and the 2014 Senior Credit Facility. Our ability to comply with these requirements may be affected by events affecting our business, but beyond our control, including prevailing general economic, financial and industry conditions. These covenants could have an adverse effect on us by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition or other corporate opportunities. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the indenture or the 2014 Senior Credit Facility.  Upon a default under any of our debt agreements, the lenders or debt holders thereunder could have the right to declare all amounts outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable, which could, in turn, trigger defaults under other debt obligations and could result in the termination of commitments of the lenders to make further extensions of credit under the 2014 Senior Credit Facility. If we were unable to repay our secured debt to our lenders, or were otherwise in default under any provision governing our outstanding secured debt obligations, our secured lenders could proceed against us and the subsidiary guarantors and against the collateral securing that debt. Any default resulting in an acceleration of outstanding indebtedness, a termination of commitments under our financing arrangements or lenders proceeding against the collateral securing such indebtedness would likely result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly. Borrowings under the 2014 Senior Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR ”) were to exceed certain levels, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available to service our obligations would decrease. The success of our business is dependent upon advertising revenues, which are seasonal and cyclical, and will also fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our main source of revenue is the sale of advertising time and space. Our ability to sell advertising time and space depends on, among other things:  ●economic conditions in the areas where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole;  ●the popularity of the programming offered by our television stations;   21   ●changes in the population demographics in the areas where our stations are located;  ●local and national advertising price fluctuations, which can be affected by the availability of programming, the popularity of programming, and the relative supply of and demand for commercial advertising;  ●our competitors’ activities, including increased competition from other advertising-based mediums, particularly cable networks, MVPDs and the internet;  ●the duration and extent of any network preemption of regularly scheduled programming for any reason;  ●decisions by advertisers to withdraw or delay planned advertising expenditures for any reason;  ●labor disputes or other disruptions at major national advertisers, programming providers or networks; and  ●other factors beyond our control. Our results are also subject to seasonal and cyclical fluctuations that we expect to continue. Seasonal fluctuations typically result in higher revenue and broadcast operating income in the second and fourth quarters than in the first and third quarters of each year. This seasonality is primarily attributable to (i) advertisers’ increased expenditures in the spring and in anticipation of holiday season spending and (ii) an increase in television viewership during this period. In addition, we typically experience fluctuations in our revenue and broadcast operating income between even and odd numbered years. In years in which there are impending elections for various state and national offices, which primarily occur in even-numbered years, political advertising revenue tends to increase, often significantly, and particularly during presidential election years. We consider political broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned from the sale to political candidates, political parties and special interest groups of advertisements broadcast by our stations. In even-numbered years, we derive a material portion of our broadcast advertising revenue from political broadcast advertisers. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we derived approximately 16% and 1%, respectively, of our total revenue from political broadcast advertisers. If political broadcast advertising revenue declined, especially in an even-numbered year, our results of operations and financial condition could also be materially adversely affected. Also, our stations affiliated with the network broadcasting the Olympic Games typically experience increased viewership and revenue during that coverage, which also occurs in even-numbered years. As a result of the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenue and broadcast operating income, and the historically significant increase in our revenue and broadcast operating income during even-numbered years, potential investors are cautioned that it has been, and is expected to remain, difficult to engage in period-over-period comparisons of our revenue and results of operations.   22  Continued uncertain financial and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Financial and economic conditions continue to be uncertain over the longer term and the continuation or worsening of such conditions could reduce consumer confidence and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. If consumer confidence were to decline, this decline could negatively affect our advertising customers’ businesses and their advertising budgets. In addition, continued volatile economic conditions could have a negative impact on our industry or the industries of our customers who advertise on our stations, resulting in reduced advertising sales. Furthermore, it may be possible that actions taken by any governmental or regulatory body for the purpose of stabilizing the economy or financial markets will not achieve their intended effect. In addition to any negative direct consequences to our business or results of operations arising from these financial and economic developments, some of these actions may adversely affect financial institutions, capital providers, advertisers or other consumers on whom we rely, including for access to future capital or financing arrangements necessary to support our business. Our inability to obtain financing in amounts and at times necessary could make it more difficult or impossible to meet our obligations or otherwise take actions in our best interests. Our dependence upon a limited number of advertising categories could adversely affect our business. We consider broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned from the sale of advertisements broadcast by our stations. Although no single customer represented more than 5% of our broadcast advertising revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014 or 2013, we derived a material portion of our non-political broadcast advertising revenue from advertisers in a limited number of industries, particularly the automotive industry. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we derived approximately 21% and 25%, respectively, of our total broadcast advertising revenue from our advertisers in the automotive industry. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if broadcast advertising revenue from the automotive, or certain other industries, such as the medical, restaurant, communications, or furniture and appliances, industries, declined. In addition, in even-numbered years, we derive a material portion of our broadcast advertising revenue from political broadcast advertisers as described above. If political broadcast advertising revenue declined, especially in an even-numbered year, our results of operations and financial condition could also be materially adversely affected. We seek to selectively evaluate growth opportunities through strategic acquisitions, and there are significant risks associated with an acquisition strategy. We intend to continue to evaluate opportunities for growth through selective acquisitions of television stations or station groups. There can be no assurances that we will be able to identify any suitable acquisition candidates, and we cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing or completing any acquisitions, or what the consequences of not completing any acquisitions would be. Consummation of any proposed acquisition at any time may also be subject to various conditions such as compliance with FCC rules and policies. Consummation of acquisitions may also be subject to antitrust or other regulatory requirements. An acquisition strategy involves numerous other risks, which includes risks associated with:  ●identifying suitable acquisition candidates and negotiating definitive purchase agreements on satisfactory terms;  ●integrating operations and systems and managing a large and geographically diverse group of stations;  ●obtaining financing to complete acquisitions, which financing may not be available to us at times, in amounts, or at rates acceptable to us, if at all, and potentially the related risks associated with increased debt;  ●diverting our management’s attention from other business concerns;   23   ●potentially losing key employees at acquired stations; and  ●potential changes in the regulatory approval process that may make it materially more expensive, or materially delay our ability, to consummate any proposed acquisitions. Our failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates, or to complete any acquisitions and integrate any acquired business, or to obtain the expected benefits therefrom, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may fail to realize any benefits and incur unanticipated losses related to any acquisition.  The success of our strategic acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine the acquired business and assets with our business and our ability to successfully manage the assets so acquired. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Successful integration may also be hampered by any differences between the operations and corporate culture of the two organizations. Additionally, general market and economic conditions may inhibit our successful integration of any business. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Finally, any cost savings that are realized may be offset by losses in revenues from the acquired business, any assets or operations disposed of in connection therewith or otherwise, or charges to earnings in connection with such acquisitions. We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations and we depend on our subsidiaries for cash. We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations, other than our investments in our subsidiaries. Because we are a holding company, we are dependent upon the payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. These payments could be or become subject to dividend or other restrictions under applicable laws in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. Payments by our subsidiaries are also contingent upon the subsidiaries’ earnings. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our financial condition and ability to meet our obligations may be adversely affected. We must purchase television programming in advance of knowing whether a particular show will be popular enough for us to recoup our costs. One of our most significant costs is for the purchase of television programming. If a particular program is not sufficiently popular among audiences in relation to the cost we pay for such program, we may not be able to sell enough related advertising time for us to recoup the costs we pay to broadcast the program. We also must usually purchase programming several years in advance, and we may have to commit to purchase more than one year’s worth of programming, resulting in the incurrence of significant costs in advance of our receipt of any related revenue. We may also replace programs that are performing poorly before we have recaptured any significant portion of the costs we incurred in obtaining such programming or fully expensed the costs for financial reporting purposes. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues, result in the incurrence of impairment charges or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues.  24  We are highly dependent upon our network affiliations, and our business and results of operations may be materially affected if a network (i) terminates its affiliation with us, (ii) significantly changes the economic terms and conditions of any future affiliation agreements with us or (iii) significantly changes the type, quality or quantity of programming provided to us under an affiliation agreement. Our business depends in large part on the success of our network affiliations. Each of our stations is affiliated with at least one of the four major broadcast networks pursuant to a separate affiliation agreement. Each affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the affiliated network during the term of the related agreement. Our affiliation agreements generally expire at various dates through August 31, 2019. If we cannot enter into affiliation agreements to replace any agreements in advance of their expiration, we would no longer be able to carry the affiliated network’s programming. This loss of programming would require us to seek to obtain replacement programming. Such replacement programming may involve higher costs and may not be as attractive to our target audiences, thereby reducing our ability to generate advertising revenue. Furthermore, our concentration of CBS and/or NBC affiliates makes us particularly sensitive to adverse changes in our business relationship with, and the general success of, CBS and/or NBC.  We can give no assurance that any future affiliation agreements will have economic terms or conditions equivalent to or more advantageous to us than our current agreements. If in the future a network or networks imposed more adverse economic terms upon us, such event or events could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, if we are unable to renew or replace any existing affiliation agreements, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations under our existing or any future retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs and/or secure payment of retransmission consent fees under such agreements. Furthermore, if in the future a network limited or removed our ability to retransmit network programming to MVPDs, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations or criteria for fees under any existing or any future retransmission consent agreements. In either case, such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are also dependent upon our retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs, and we cannot predict the outcome of potential regulatory changes to the retransmission consent regime.  We are also dependent, in significant part, on our retransmission consent agreements. Our current retransmission consent agreements expire at various times over the next several years, and no significant retransmission consent agreement expires prior to December 31, 2015. No assurances can be provided that we will be able to renegotiate all of such agreements on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. The failure to renegotiate such agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our ability to successfully negotiate future retransmission consent agreements may be hindered by potential legislative or regulatory charges to the framework under which these agreements are negotiated.   25  For example, on March 31, 2014, the FCC amended its rules governing “good faith” retransmission consent negotiations to provide that it is a per se violation of the statutory duty to negotiate in good faith for a television broadcast station that is ranked among the top-four stations in a market (as measured by audience share) to negotiate retransmission consent jointly with another top-four station in the same market if the stations are not commonly owned. Under the new rules, top-four stations may not (i) delegate authority to negotiate or approve a retransmission consent agreement to another non-commonly owned top-four station located in the same DMA or to a third party that negotiates on behalf of another non-commonly owned top-four television station in the same DMA; or (ii) facilitate or agree to facilitate coordinated negotiation of retransmission consent terms between themselves, including through the sharing of information. We currently are not a party to any agreements that delegate our authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any of our television stations or grant us authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any other television station. Nevertheless, we cannot predict how this restriction might impact future opportunities.  As part of its decision, the FCC also sought comment on whether it should modify or eliminate the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. If, however, the FCC eliminates or relaxes its rules enforcing our program exclusivity rights, it could affect our ability to negotiate future retransmission consent agreements, and it could harm our ratings and advertising revenue if cable and satellite operators import duplicative programming.  In addition, certain online video distributors (“OVDs”) have explored streaming broadcast programming over the Internet without approval from or payments to the broadcaster. To date, federal courts have issued preliminary injunctions enjoining these OVDs from streaming broadcast programming because the courts have concluded that OVD are unlikely to demonstrate that they are eligible for the statutory copyright license that provides cable operators with the requisite copyrights to retransmit broadcast programming. We cannot predict whether the courts will continue to issue similar injunctions against future OVDs. Separately, on December 19, 2014, the FCC issued an NPRM proposing to classify certain OVDs as MVPDs for purposes of certain FCC carriage rules. If the FCC adopts its proposal, OVDs would need to negotiate for consent from broadcasters before they retransmit broadcast signals. We cannot predict whether the FCC will adopt its proposal or other modified rules that might weaken our rights to negotiate with OVDs. Congress also continues to consider various changes to the statutory scheme governing retransmission of broadcast programming. Some of the proposed bills would make it more difficult to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with large MVPDs and would weaken our leverage to seek market-based compensation for our programming. We cannot predict whether any of these proposals will become law, and, if any do, we cannot determine the effect that any statutory changes would have on our business. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Competition occurs on multiple levels (for audiences, programming and advertisers) and is based on a variety of factors. If we are not able to successfully compete in all relevant aspects, our revenues will be materially adversely affected. Television stations compete for audiences, certain programming (including news) and advertisers. Signal coverage and carriage on MVPD systems also materially affect a television station’s competitive position. With respect to audiences, stations compete primarily based on broadcast program popularity. We cannot provide any assurances as to the acceptability by audiences of any of the programs we broadcast. Further, because we compete with other broadcast stations for certain programming, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain any desired programming at costs that we believe are reasonable. Cable-network programming combined with increased access to cable and satellite TV, has become a significant competitor for broadcast television programming viewers. Cable networks’ viewership and advertising share have increased due to the growth in MVPD penetration (the percentage of television households that are connected to a MVPD system) and increased investments in programming by cable networks. Further increases in the advertising share of cable networks could materially adversely affect the advertising revenue of our television stations.  26  In addition, technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of programming alternatives, such as internet websites, mobile apps and wireless carriers, direct-to-consumer video distribution systems, and home entertainment systems have further fractionalized television viewing audiences and resulted in additional challenges to revenue generation. Our inability or failure to broadcast popular programs, or otherwise maintain viewership for any reason, including as a result of increases in programming alternatives, could result in a lack of advertisers, or a reduction in the amount advertisers are willing to pay us to advertise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our pension plan obligations are currently underfunded, and, if certain factors worsen, we may have to make significant cash payments to some or all of these plans, which could reduce the cash available for our business. We have underfunded obligations under our defined benefit pension plans. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of certain market interest rates and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations. Unfavorable returns on the plan assets or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations may materially change the timing and amount of required plan funding, which could reduce the cash available for our business. In addition, any future decreases in the discount rate used to determine pension obligations could result in an increase in the valuation of pension obligations, which could affect the reported funding status of our pension plans and future contributions, as well as the periodic pension cost in subsequent fiscal years. We do not currently pay cash dividends on either class of our common stock. To the extent a potential investor ascribes value to a dividend paying stock, the value of our stock may be correspondingly reduced. Our Board of Directors has not declared a cash or stock dividend on our common stock or Class A common stock since 2008. The timing and amount of any future dividend is at the discretion of our board of directors, and they may be subject to limitations or restrictions in the 2014 Senior Credit Facility and other financing agreements we may be, or become, party to. We can provide no assurance when or if any future dividends will be declared on either class of common stock. As a result, if and to the extent an investor ascribes value to a dividend-paying stock, the value of our common stock and Class A common stock may be correspondingly reduced. We may be unable to maintain or increase our internet advertising revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. We generate a portion of our advertising revenue from the sale of advertisements on our internet sites. Our ability to maintain and increase this advertising revenue is largely dependent upon the number of users actively visiting our internet sites. As a result we must increase user engagement with our internet sites in order to increase our advertising revenue. Because internet advertising techniques are evolving, if our technology and advertisement serving techniques do not evolve to meet the changing needs of advertisers, our advertising revenue could also decline. Changes in our business model, advertising inventory or initiatives could also cause a decrease in our internet advertising revenue. We do not have long-term agreements with most of our internet advertisers. Any termination, change or decrease in our relationships with our largest advertising clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. If we do not maintain or increase our advertising revenue, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.   27  We have, in the past, incurred impairment charges on our goodwill and/or broadcast licenses, and any such future charges may have a material effect on the value of our total assets. As of December 31, 2014, the book value of our broadcast licenses was $1.0 billion and the book value of our goodwill was $374.4 million, in comparison to total assets of $1.9 billion. Not less than annually, and more frequently if necessary, we are required to evaluate our goodwill and broadcast licenses to determine if the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value. If the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value, we will be required to record a non-cash expense to write-down the book value of the intangible asset to the estimated fair value. We cannot make any assurances that any required impairment charges will not have a material adverse effect on our total assets.  Cybersecurity risks could affect our operating effectiveness. We use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. Our revenues are increasingly dependent on digital products. Such use exposes us to potential cyber incidents resulting from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents can include, but are not limited to, unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, data corruption or operational disruption. The results of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, business interruption, disclosure of nonpublic information, decreased advertising revenues, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation, financial consequences and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence, any or all of which could adversely affect our business. We have systems and processes in place to protect against risks associated with cyber incidents however, depending on the nature of an incident, these protections may not be fully sufficient. Federal broadcasting industry regulations limit our operating flexibility. The FCC regulates all television broadcasters, including us. We must obtain FCC approval whenever we (i) apply for a new license, (ii) seek to renew, modify or assign a license, (iii) purchase a broadcast station and/or (iv) transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries that holds a license. Our FCC licenses are critical to our operations, and we cannot operate without them. We cannot be certain that the FCC will renew these licenses in the future or approve new acquisitions, mergers, divestitures or other business activities. Our failure to renew any licenses upon the expiration of any license term could have a material adverse effect on our business. Federal legislation and FCC rules have changed significantly in recent years and may continue to change. These changes may limit our ability to conduct our business in ways that we believe would be advantageous and may affect our operating results. The FCC can sanction us for programming broadcast on our stations that it finds to be indecent. Over the past several years, the FCC has increased its enforcement efforts regarding broadcast indecency and profanity and the statutory maximum fine for broadcasting indecent material is currently $350,000 per incident. In June 2012, the Supreme Court decided a challenge to the FCC’s indecency enforcement without resolving the scope of the FCC’s ability to regulate broadcast content. The FCC has not yet issued any further decisions concerning its indecency enforcement authority, and the courts remain free to review the FCC’s current policy or any modifications thereto. The outcomes of these proceedings could affect future FCC policies in this area, and we are unable to predict the outcome of any such judicial proceeding, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  28  The FCC’s duopoly restrictions limit our ability to own and operate multiple television stations in the same market. The FCC’s ownership rules generally prohibit us from owning or having “attributable interests” in television stations located in the same markets in which our stations are licensed. Accordingly, those rules constrain our ability to expand in our present markets through additional station acquisitions. The FCC’s National Television Station Ownership Rule limits the maximum number of households we can reach. Under the FCC’s National Television Station Ownership Rule, a single television station owner may not reach more than 39 percent of U.S. households through commonly owned television stations. This rule may constrain our ability to expand through additional station acquisitions. The FCC’s National Broadband Plan could result in the reallocation of broadcast spectrum for wireless broadband or other non-broadcast use, which could materially impair our ability to provide competitive services. In 2010, the FCC delivered to Congress a “National Broadband Plan.” The National Broadband Plan, among other things, made recommendations regarding the use of spectrum currently allocated to television broadcasters, including seeking the voluntary surrender of certain portions of the television broadcast spectrum and repacking the currently allocated spectrum to make portions of that spectrum available for other wireless communications services.  In late February 2012, Congress passed and the President signed legislation that, among other things, grants the FCC authority to conduct auctions of certain spectrum currently used by television broadcasters. These auctions would have two parts. First, the FCC would conduct a reverse auction by which a television broadcaster may volunteer, in return for payment, to relinquish its station’s spectrum by surrendering its license; relinquish part of its spectrum and thereafter share spectrum with another station; or modify a UHF channel license to a VHF channel license. Second, the FCC would conduct a forward auction of the relinquished auction to new users. The FCC must complete the reverse auction and the forward auction by September 30, 2022. To accommodate the spectrum reallocation to new users, the FCC may require that television stations that do not participate in the auction modify their transmission facilities. The legislation authorizes the FCC to reimburse stations for reasonable relocation costs up to a total across all stations of $1.75 billion. In addition, the legislation directs the FCC to use “reasonable efforts” to preserve a station’s coverage area and population served, and it prevents the FCC from requiring that a station involuntarily move from the UHF band to the VHF band or from the high VHF band to the low VHF band. If some or all of our television stations are required to change frequencies or reduce the amount of spectrum they use, our stations could incur substantial conversion costs, reduction or loss of over-the-air signal coverage or an inability to provide high definition programming and additional program streams, including mobile video services. On April 27, 2012, the FCC issued a Report and Order modifying the FCC’s rules to establish a licensing framework to allow two or more broadcast stations to share a 6Mhz channel. On May 15, 2014, the FCC adopted the 2014 Report that established the framework for implementation of an incentive auction of broadcast television spectrum. Various groups challenged the rules adopted in the 2014 Order at the FCC and US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. The FCC continues to develop and seek public comment on final auction policies and procedures. We cannot predict the likelihood, timing or outcome of any Congressional, FCC regulatory, or Court action with respect to the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, incentive auctions, or repacking of broadcast television spectrum, nor the impact of any such changes upon our business.  29  "
1,GTN,GRAY TELEVISION INC,2014-03-11,"Risk Factors
. In addition to the other information contained and referred to in this report, you should consider carefully the following factors when evaluating our business. Any of these risks, or the occurrence of any of the events described in these risk factors, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently do not deem material could arise, any of which could also materially adversely affect us. This report also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the occurrence of one or more of the following risk factors.  We have substantial debt and have the ability to incur significant additional debt. The principal and interest payment obligations on such debt may restrict our future operations and impair our ability to meet our long-term debt obligations. At December 31, 2013, we had approximately $842.9 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness (excluding intercompany indebtedness). We have the ability to incur significant additional debt, including secured debt, under our senior credit facility (the “2012 Senior Credit Facility”). In addition, the terms of the indenture governing our outstanding 7½% Senior Notes due 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) (as supplemented, the “indenture”) also permit us to incur additional indebtedness, subject to our ability to meet certain borrowing conditions. Our substantial debt may have important consequences. For instance, it could:  ●require us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt, which would reduce funds available for other business purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions;  ●place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors that may have less debt and better access to capital resources;   ●limit our ability to obtain additional financing required to fund acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes; and  ●make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations.  18  Our ability to service our significant financial obligations depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow. This is partially subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, that future borrowings will be available to us under the 2012 Senior Credit Facility or any other credit facilities, or that we will be able to complete any necessary financings, in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our operations or pay our debts and other obligations, or to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts, at times or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Specifically, volatility in the capital markets may also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, or to refinance our existing debt, on terms or at times favorable to us. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to service our debt or other obligations, which could result in us being in default thereon, in which circumstances our lenders could cease making loans to us, and lenders or other holders of our debt could accelerate and declare due all outstanding obligations due under the respective agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on us.  The agreements governing our various debt obligations impose restrictions on our operations and limit our ability to undertake certain corporate actions. The agreements governing our various debt obligations, including the indenture and the agreements governing the 2012 Senior Credit Facility, include covenants imposing significant restrictions on our operations. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These covenants place restrictions on our ability to, among other things:  ●incur additional debt, subject to certain limitations;  ●declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders;  ●make investments or acquisitions;  ●create liens or use assets as security in other transactions;  ●issue guarantees;  ●merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets;  ●amend our articles of incorporation or bylaws;  ●engage in transactions with affiliates; and  ●purchase, sell or transfer certain assets.  Any of these restrictions and limitations could make it more difficult for us to execute our business strategy.  19  The indenture and the 2012 Senior Credit Facility also require us to comply with a number of financial ratios and covenants; our failure to do so would result in a default thereunder, which would have a material adverse effect on us. We are also required to comply with a number of financial covenants under the indenture and the 2012 Senior Credit Facility. Our ability to comply with these requirements may be affected by events affecting our business, but beyond our control, including prevailing general economic, financial and industry conditions. These covenants could have an adverse effect on us by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition or other corporate opportunities. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the indenture or the 2012 Senior Credit Facility.  Upon a default under any of our debt agreements, the lenders or debt holders thereunder could have the right to declare all amounts outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable, which could, in turn, trigger defaults under other debt obligations and could result in the termination of commitments of the lenders to make further extensions of credit under the 2012 Senior Credit Facility. If we were unable to repay our secured debt to our lenders, or were otherwise in default under any provision governing our outstanding secured debt obligations, our secured lenders could proceed against us and the subsidiary guarantors and against the collateral securing that debt. Any default resulting in an acceleration of outstanding indebtedness, a termination of commitments under our financing arrangements or lenders proceeding against the collateral securing such indebtedness would likely result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly. Borrowings under the 2012 Senior Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) were to exceed certain levels, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available to service our obligations would decrease. The success of our business is dependent upon advertising revenues, which are seasonal and cyclical, and will also fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our main source of revenue is the sale of advertising time and space. Our ability to sell advertising time and space depends on, among other things:  ●economic conditions in the areas where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole;  ●the popularity of the programming offered by our television stations;  ●changes in the population demographics in the areas where our stations are located;  ●local and national advertising price fluctuations, which can be affected by the availability of programming, the popularity of programming, and the relative supply of and demand for commercial advertising;  ●our competitors’ activities, including increased competition from other advertising-based mediums, particularly cable networks, MVPDs and the internet;  20   ●the duration and extent of any network preemption of regularly scheduled programming for any reason;  ●decisions by advertisers to withdraw or delay planned advertising expenditures for any reason;  ●labor disputes or other disruptions at major national advertisers, programming providers or networks; and  ●other factors beyond our control. Our results are also subject to seasonal and cyclical fluctuations that we expect to continue. Seasonal fluctuations typically result in higher revenue and broadcast operating income in the second and fourth quarters than in the first and third quarters of each year. This seasonality is primarily attributable to (i) advertisers’ increased expenditures in the spring and in anticipation of holiday season spending and (ii) an increase in television viewership during this period. In addition, we typically experience fluctuations in our revenue and broadcast operating income between even and odd numbered years. In years in which there are impending elections for various state and national offices, which primarily occur in even numbered years, political advertising revenue tends to increase, often significantly, and particularly during presidential election years. Also, our NBC network affiliated stations typically experience increased viewership and revenue during coverage of Olympic Games, which also occur in even numbered years. As a result of the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenue and broadcast operating income, and the historically significant increase in our revenue and broadcast operating income during even-numbered years, potential investors are cautioned that it has been, and is expected to remain, difficult to engage in period-over-period comparisons of our revenue and results of operations. Continued uncertain financial and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Financial and economic conditions continue to be uncertain over the longer term and the continuation or worsening of such conditions could reduce consumer confidence and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. If consumer confidence were to decline, this decline could negatively affect our advertising customers’ businesses and their advertising budgets. In addition, continued volatile economic conditions could have a negative impact on our industry or the industries of our customers who advertise on our stations, resulting in reduced advertising sales. Furthermore, it may be possible that actions taken by any governmental or regulatory body for the purpose of stabilizing the economy or financial markets will not achieve their intended effect. In addition to any negative direct consequences to our business or results of operations arising from these financial and economic developments, some of these actions may adversely affect financial institutions, capital providers, advertisers or other consumers on whom we rely, including for access to future capital or financing arrangements necessary to support our business. Our inability to obtain financing in amounts and at times necessary could make it more difficult or impossible to meet our obligations or otherwise take actions in our best interests. Our dependence upon a limited number of advertising categories could adversely affect our business. We consider broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned from the sale of advertisements broadcast by our stations. Although no single customer represented more than 5% of our broadcast advertising revenue for the years ended December 31, 2013 or 2012, we derived a material portion of our non-political broadcast advertising revenue from advertisers in a limited number of industries, particularly the automotive industry. For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we derived approximately 25% and 18%, respectively, of our total broadcast advertising revenue from our advertisers in the automotive industry. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if broadcast advertising revenue from the automotive, or certain other industries, such as the medical, restaurant, communications, or furniture and appliances, industries, declined.  21   We consider political broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned from the sale to political candidates, political parties and special interest groups of advertisements broadcast by our stations. In even numbered years, we derive a material portion of our broadcast advertising revenue from political broadcast advertisers. For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we derived approximately 1% and 21%, respectively, of our total revenue from political broadcast advertisers. If political broadcast advertising revenue declined, especially in an even numbered year, our results of operations and financial condition could also be materially adversely affected. If we are unable to complete the Hoak Acquisition, we could be liable to Hoak for breach of contract, and our stock price could suffer.  On November 20, 2013, the Company entered into a series of transactions pursuant to which Gray and Excalibur will acquire ownership or operating rights to 15 network-affiliated television stations, including satellite stations, in seven markets (after giving effect to stations required to be divested due to regulatory requirements) from Hoak Media LLC and Parker Broadcasting, Inc. (the “Hoak Acquisition”). Consummation of the Hoak Acquisition is subject to various customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval from the FCC. The Hoak Acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2014, although no assurances can be provided that we will be able to consummate the Hoak Acquisition on the expected timeline, or at all. If the Hoak Acquisition is not completed, we could be liable to Hoak for breach of contract, and the market price of our stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Hoak Acquisition will be completed. In addition, we have incurred and will incur substantial transaction costs and expenses in connection with the Hoak Acquisition. These costs are primarily associated with the fees of attorneys, accountants and our financial advisors. Further, we have diverted significant management resources in an effort to complete the Hoak Acquisition. If the Hoak Acquisition is not completed, we will have incurred significant costs, including the diversion of management resources, for which we will have received little or no benefit. Additionally, if the Hoak Acquisition is not completed, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and our advertisers, stockholders and employees. Each of these factors may also adversely affect the trading price of our stock and our financial results and operations.  If we are unable to finance the Hoak Acquisition, we may not be able to complete the acquisition.  We expect to fund the purchase price to complete the Hoak Acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and funds from one or more external financing sources, which could include senior credit facility financing or proceeds from the issuance of other debt or equity securities. We currently have no commitments from any financing source relating to the financing of the Hoak Acquisition. In the event we are unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, in a timely manner, or at all, we may not be able to complete the Hoak Acquisition. In such event, Hoak could pursue an action against us to compel us to complete the acquisition or for damages, either of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, if we fund the Hoak Acquisition through the issuance of new equity securities, these newly issued shares could substantially dilute the ownership interests of outstanding stockholders.   22  We could incur substantial additional long-term indebtedness in connection with the Hoak Acquisition, which would increase the risks we now face with our current indebtedness.  We may finance the Hoak Acquisition with senior credit facility borrowing or the issuance of other debt. As a result, we may have long-term indebtedness that will be substantially greater than our long-term indebtedness prior to the Hoak Acquisition. This additional indebtedness would increase the related risks we now face with our current indebtedness described above. We may not realize the expected benefits of the Hoak Acquisition because of integration difficulties and other challenges.  The success of the Hoak Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies and cost savings from integrating Hoak’s business with our existing business. The integration process may be complex, costly and time-consuming. The difficulties of integrating the operation of Hoak’s business could include, among others:    ●failure to implement our business plan for the combined business;    ●unanticipated issues in integrating information, communications and other systems;   ●unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations, including FCC rules;    ●the impact on our internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and    ●other unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities.  We may not accomplish the integration of Hoak’s business smoothly, successfully or within the anticipated costs or time frame. The diversion of the attention of management from our current operations to the integration effort and any difficulties encountered in combining operations could prevent us from realizing the full benefits anticipated to result from the Hoak Acquisition and could adversely affect our business.  We seek to selectively evaluate growth opportunities through strategic acquisitions, and there are significant risks associated with an acquisition strategy. We intend to continue to evaluate opportunities for growth through selective acquisitions of television stations or station groups. There can be no assurances that we will be able to identify any suitable acquisition candidates, and we cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing or completing any acquisitions, or what the consequences of not completing any acquisitions would be. Consummation of any proposed acquisition at any time may also be subject to various conditions such as compliance with FCC rules and policies. Consummation of acquisitions may also be subject to antitrust regulatory requirements. An acquisition strategy involves numerous other risks, which may include risks associated with:  ●identifying suitable acquisition candidates and negotiating definitive purchase agreements on satisfactory terms;  ●integrating operations and systems and managing a large and geographically diverse group of stations;  23   ●obtaining financing to complete acquisitions, which financing may not be available to us at times, in amounts, or at rates acceptable to us, if at all, and potentially the related risks associated with increased debt;  ●diverting our management’s attention from other business concerns;  ●potentially losing key employees at acquired stations; and  ●potential changes in the regulatory approval process that may make it materially more expensive, or materially delay our ability, to consummate any proposed acquisitions.  Our failure to identify acquisition candidates, or to complete or integrate any acquired business, or to obtain the expected benefits therefrom, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are a holding company with no independent assets or operations and we depend on our subsidiaries for cash. We are a holding company with no independent assets or operations, other than our investments in our subsidiaries. Because we are a holding company, we are dependent upon the payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. These payments could be or become subject to dividend or other restrictions under applicable laws in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. Payments by our subsidiaries are also contingent upon the subsidiaries’ earnings. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our financial condition and ability to meet our obligations may be adversely affected. We must purchase television programming in advance of knowing whether a particular show will be popular enough for us to recoup our costs. One of our most significant costs is for the purchase of television programming. If a particular program is not sufficiently popular among audiences in relation to the cost we pay for such program, we may not be able to sell enough related advertising time for us to recoup the costs we pay to broadcast the program. We also must usually purchase programming several years in advance, and we may have to commit to purchase more than one year’s worth of programming, resulting in the incurrence of significant costs in advance of our receipt of any related revenue. We may also replace programs that are performing poorly before we have recaptured any significant portion of the costs we incurred in obtaining such programming or fully expensed the costs for financial reporting purposes. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues, result in the incurrence of impairment charges or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues. We are highly dependent upon our network affiliations, and we may lose a large amount of television programming if a network (i) terminates its affiliation with us, (ii) significantly changes the economic terms and conditions of any future affiliation agreements with us or (iii) significantly changes the type, quality or quantity of programming provided to us under an affiliation agreement. Our business depends in large part on the success of our network affiliations. Each of our stations is affiliated with at least one major network pursuant to affiliation agreements. Each affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the affiliated network during the term of the related agreement. Our affiliation agreements generally expire at various dates through December 31, 2018.  24  If we cannot enter into affiliation agreements to replace any expiring agreements, we would no longer be able to carry the affiliated network’s programming. This loss of programming would require us to seek to obtain replacement programming. Such replacement programming may involve higher costs and may not be as attractive to our target audiences, thereby reducing our ability to generate advertising revenue. Furthermore, our concentration of CBS and/or NBC affiliates makes us particularly sensitive to adverse changes in our business relationship with, and the general success of, CBS and/or NBC. We can give no assurance that any future affiliation agreements will have economic terms or conditions equivalent to or more advantageous to us than our current agreements. If in the future a network or networks imposed more adverse economic terms upon us, such event or events could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, if we are unable to renew or replace any existing affiliation agreements, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations under our existing or any future retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs and/or secure payment of retransmission consent fees under such agreements. Furthermore, if in the future a network limited or removed our ability to retransmit network programming to MVPDs, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations or criteria for fees under any existing or any future retransmission consent agreements. In either case, such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are also dependent upon our retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs, and we cannot predict the outcome of potential regulatory changes to the retransmission consent regime.  We are also dependent, in significant part, on our retransmission consent agreements. Our current retransmission consent agreements are set to expire at various times through December 2017. No assurances can be provided that we will be able to renegotiate all of such agreements on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. The failure to renegotiate such agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our ability to successfully negotiate future retransmission consent agreements may be hindered by potential legislative or regulatory charges to the framework under which these agreements are negotiated. For example, in March 2011, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (the “2011 NPRM”) to consider changes to its rules governing the negotiation of retransmission consent agreements. The FCC concluded that it lacked statutory authority to impose mandatory arbitration or interim carriage obligations in the event of a dispute between broadcasters and pay television operators. The FCC, however, sought comment on whether it should (1) strengthen the existing regulatory provision requiring broadcasters and MVPDs to negotiate retransmission consent in “good faith,” (2) enhance notice obligations to consumers of potential disruptions in service, and/or (3) extend the prohibition on ceasing carriage of a broadcast station’s signal during an audience measurement period to DBS systems. The 2011 NPRM also questioned whether the FCC should eliminate the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules. The FCC has not yet issued a decision in this proceeding, and we cannot predict the outcome of any FCC regulatory action in this regard. In addition, certain online video distributors and other OVDs have begun to stream broadcast programming over the Internet without the consent of the broadcast station. In one case relating to that issue, a federal district court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining an OVD from streaming broadcast programming because the court concluded that the OVD was unlikely to demonstrate that it was eligible for the statutory copyright license that provides cable operators with the requisite copyrights to retransmit broadcast programming, and in August 2012, the Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision. In another case, a preliminary injunction against an entity providing access to broadcast programming over the Internet was denied. In that case, the federal district court for the Southern District of New York concluded that the operator was likely to prevail in demonstrating that the leasing of antennas and other equipment that enables a consumer to access broadcast programming over the Internet is not a copyright violation. That ruling has been sustained by the Second Circuit and the case has been returned to the district court for trial. In a case against another entity presenting similar facts, the federal district court for the Central District of California, rejecting the rationale of the New York district court, enjoined operations, finding that the transmissions were copyright infringements. That decision has been appealed to the Ninth Circuit. In September 2013, a district court in Washington D.C. reached a similar decision as the California district court in a separate lawsuit against the same OVD, finding that broadcast networks have a protectable copyright that appears to be violated by the internet distribution. That court imposed a nationwide injunction (exempting the Second Circuit) against that OVD. In October 2013, broadcasters in Salt Lake City, Utah, filed suit against the same OVD challenging the legality of the OVD’s service. Also in October 2013, the district court in Massachusetts denied another broadcaster’s request for an injunction against the OVD. On October 11, 2013, the four major networks filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review of the Second Circuit’s decision upholding the denial of their request for an injunction against that OVD. In January 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to consider this appeal. In 2010, the FCC’s Media   25  Bureau, in a program access proceeding, tentatively concluded that one OVD had not shown that it was an MVPD for purposes of demonstrating eligibility for the program access rules, and in March 2012, the FCC, recognizing that the classification could also have implications under the retransmission consent requirements, issued a public notice seeking comment on, among other things, the proper interpretation of the term “MVPD” under FCC rules. We cannot predict the outcome of the pending litigation or of the FCC’s interpretive proceedings. However, if the courts determine that consent of the broadcast station or copyright owners is not required and if the FCC determines that an OVD is not an MVPD, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Competition occurs on multiple levels (for audiences, programming and advertisers) and is based on a variety of factors. If we are not able to successfully compete in all relevant aspects, our revenues will be materially adversely affected. Television stations compete for audiences, certain programming (including news) and advertisers. Signal coverage and carriage on MVPD systems also materially affect a television station’s competitive position. With respect to audiences, stations compete primarily based on broadcast program popularity. We cannot provide any assurances as to the acceptability by audiences of any of the programs we broadcast. Further, because we compete with other broadcast stations for certain programming, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain any desired programming at costs that we believe are reasonable. Cable-network programming combined with increased access to cable and satellite TV, has become a significant competitor for broadcast television programming viewers. Cable networks’ viewership and advertising share have increased due to the growth in MVPD penetration (the percentage of television households that are connected to a MVPD system) and increased investments in programming by cable networks. Further increases in the advertising share of cable networks could materially adversely affect the advertising revenue of our television stations. In addition, technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of programming alternatives, such as internet websites, mobile apps and wireless carriers, direct-to-consumer video distribution systems, and home entertainment systems have further fractionalized television viewing audiences and resulted in additional challenges to revenue generation. Our inability or failure to broadcast popular programs, or otherwise maintain viewership for any reason, including as a result of increases in programming alternatives, could result in a lack of advertisers, or a reduction in the amount advertisers are willing to pay us to advertise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  26  Our pension plan obligations are currently underfunded, and, if certain factors worsen, we may have to make significant cash payments to some or all of these plans, which could reduce the cash available for our business. We have underfunded obligations under our defined benefit pension plans. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of certain market interest rates and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations. Unfavorable returns on the plan assets or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations may materially change the timing and amount of required plan funding, which could reduce the cash available for our business. In addition, a decrease in the already historically low discount rate used to determine pension obligations could result in an increase in the valuation of pension obligations, which could affect the reported funding status of our pension plans and future contributions, as well as the periodic pension cost in subsequent fiscal years. We do not currently pay cash dividends on either class of our common stock. To the extent a potential investor ascribes value to a dividend paying stock, the value of our stock may be correspondingly reduced. Our Board of Directors has not declared a cash or stock dividend on our common stock or Class A common stock since 2008. The timing and amount of any future dividend is at the discretion of our board of directors, and they may be subject to limitations or restrictions in the 2012 Senior Credit Facility and other financing agreements we may be, or become, party to. We can provide no assurance when or if any future dividends will be declared on either class of common stock. As a result, if and to the extent an investor ascribes value to a dividend-paying stock, the value of our common stock and Class A common stock may be correspondingly reduced. We may be unable to maintain or increase our internet advertising revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. We generate a portion of our advertising revenue from the sale of advertisements on our internet sites. Our ability to maintain or increase this advertising revenue is largely dependent upon the number of users actively visiting our internet sites. We believe we must increase user engagement with our internet sites in order to increase our advertising revenue. Because internet advertising techniques are evolving, if our technology and advertisement serving techniques do not evolve to meet the changing needs of advertisers, our advertising revenue could also decline. Changes in our business model, advertising inventory or initiatives could also cause a decrease in our internet advertising revenue. We do not have long-term agreements with most of our internet advertisers. Any termination, change or decrease in our relationships with our largest advertising clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. If we do not maintain or increase our advertising revenue, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  If we are unable to protect our domain names, our reputation and brands could be adversely affected. We currently hold various domain name registrations relating to our brands. The registration and maintenance of domain names generally are regulated by governmental agencies and their designees. Governing bodies may establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may be unable to register or maintain relevant domain names. In addition, we may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from registering domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of, our trademarks and other proprietary rights. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brands, and make it more difficult for users to find our websites and our services.  27    Any potential hostilities or terrorist attacks, or similar events leading to broadcast interruptions, may affect our revenues and results of operations. If the United States engages in additional foreign hostilities or existing hostilities escalate, or if the United States experiences a terrorist attack or experiences any similar event resulting in interruptions to regularly scheduled broadcasting, we may lose advertising revenue and/or incur increased expenses. Lost revenue and increased expenses may be due to pre-emption, delay or cancellation of advertising campaigns, and increased costs of covering such events. We cannot predict the (i) extent or duration of any future disruption to our programming schedule, (ii) amount of advertising revenue that would be lost or delayed or (iii) amount by which our broadcasting expenses would increase as a result. Any such loss of revenue and increased expenses could negatively affect our future results of operations. We have, in the past, incurred impairment charges on our goodwill and/or broadcast licenses, and any such future charges may have a material effect on the value of our total assets. As of December 31, 2013, the book value of our broadcast licenses was $839.0 million and the book value of our goodwill was $184.4 million, in comparison to total assets of $1.3 billion. Not less than annually, and more frequently if necessary, we are required to evaluate our goodwill and broadcast licenses to determine if the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value. If the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value, we will be required to record a non-cash expense to write-down the book value of the intangible asset to the estimated fair value. We cannot make any assurances that any required impairment charges will not have a material adverse effect on our total assets.  Federal broadcasting industry regulations limit our operating flexibility. The FCC regulates all television broadcasters, including us. We must obtain FCC approval whenever we (i) apply for a new license, (ii) seek to renew, modify or assign a license, (iii) purchase a broadcast station and/or (iv) transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries that holds a license. Our FCC licenses are critical to our operations, and we cannot operate without them. We cannot be certain that the FCC will renew these licenses in the future or approve new acquisitions, mergers, divestitures or other business activities. Our failure to renew any licenses upon the expiration of any license term could have a material adverse effect on our business. Federal legislation and FCC rules have changed significantly in recent years and may continue to change. These changes may limit our ability to conduct our business in ways that we believe would be advantageous and may affect our operating results. The FCC can sanction us for programming broadcast on our stations that it finds to be indecent. Over the past several years, the FCC has increased its enforcement efforts regarding broadcast indecency and profanity and the statutory maximum fine for broadcasting indecent material is currently $325,000 per incident. In June 2012, the Supreme Court decided a challenge to the FCC’s indecency enforcement without resolving the scope of the FCC’s ability to regulate broadcast content. The FCC has not yet issued any further decisions concerning its indecency enforcement authority, and the courts remain free to review the FCC’s current policy or any modifications thereto. The outcomes of these proceedings could affect future FCC policies in this area, and we are unable to predict the outcome of any such judicial proceeding, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  28    The FCC’s duopoly restrictions limit our ability to own and operate multiple television stations in the same market. The FCC’s ownership rules generally prohibit us from owning or having “attributable interests” in television stations located in the same markets in which our stations are licensed. Accordingly, those rules constrain our ability to expand in our present markets through additional station acquisitions. The FCC’s National Television Station Ownership Rule limits the maximum number of households we can reach. Under the FCC’s National Television Station Ownership Rule, a single television station owner may not reach more than 39 percent of U.S. households through commonly owned television stations. This rule may constrain our ability to expand through additional station acquisitions. The FCC’s National Broadband Plan could result in the reallocation of broadcast spectrum for wireless broadband or other non-broadcast use, which could materially impair our ability to provide competitive services. In 2010, the FCC delivered to Congress a “National Broadband Plan.” The National Broadband Plan, among other things, makes recommendations regarding the use of spectrum currently allocated to television broadcasters, including seeking the voluntary surrender of certain portions of the television broadcast spectrum and repacking the currently allocated spectrum to make portions of that spectrum available for other wireless communications services. If some or all of our television stations are required to change frequencies or reduce the amount of spectrum they use, our stations could incur substantial conversion costs, reduction or loss of over-the-air signal coverage or an inability to provide high definition programming and additional program streams, including mobile video services. In late February 2012, Congress passed and the President signed legislation that, among other things, grants the FCC authority to conduct auctions of certain spectrum currently used by television broadcasters. These auctions would have two parts. First, the FCC would conduct a reverse auction by which a television broadcaster may volunteer, in return for payment, to relinquish its station’s spectrum by surrendering its license; relinquish part of its spectrum and thereafter share spectrum with another station; or modify a UHF channel license to a VHF channel license. Second, the FCC would conduct a forward auction of the relinquished auction to new users. The FCC must complete the reverse auction and the forward auction by September 30, 2022. To accommodate the spectrum reallocation to new users, the FCC may require that television stations that do not participate in the auction modify their transmission facilities. The legislation authorizes the FCC to reimburse stations for reasonable relocation costs up to a total across all stations of $1.75 billion. In addition, the legislation directs the FCC to use “reasonable efforts” to preserve a station’s coverage area and population served, and it prevents the FCC from requiring that a station involuntarily move from the UHF band to the VHF band or from the high VHF band to the low VHF band. On April 27, 2012, the FCC issued a Report and Order modifying the FCC’s rules to establish a licensing framework to allow two or more broadcast stations to share a 6Mhz channel. On September 28, 2012, the FCC adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to implement an incentive auction of broadcast television spectrum. We cannot predict the likelihood, timing or outcome of any Congressional or FCC regulatory action with respect to the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, incentive auctions, or repacking of broadcast television spectrum, nor the impact of any such changes upon our business.  29  "
16,GTN,GRAY TELEVISION INC,2013-03-05,"Risk Factors
. The success of our business is dependent upon advertising revenues, which are seasonal and cyclical, and will also fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control.Our main source of revenue is the sale of advertising time and space. Our ability to sell advertising time and space depends on, among other things:·     economic conditions in the areas where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole;·     the popularity of the programming offered by our television stations;·     changes in the population demographics in the areas where our stations are located;·     local and national advertising price fluctuations, which can be affected by the availability of programming, the popularity of programming, and the relative supply of and demand for commercial advertising;·     our competitors’ activities, including increased competition from other advertising-based mediums, particularly cable networks, MVPDs and the internet;·     the duration and extent of any network preemption of regularly scheduled programming for any reason;·     decisions by advertisers to withdraw or delay planned advertising expenditures for any reason;·     labor disputes or other disruptions at major national advertisers, programming providers or networks; and·     other factors beyond our control.Our results are also subject to seasonal and cyclical fluctuations that we expect to continue. Seasonal fluctuations typically result in higher broadcast operating income in the second and fourth quarters than in the first and third quarters of each year. This seasonality is primarily attributable to (i) advertisers’ increased expenditures in the spring and in anticipation of the holiday season spending and (ii) an increase in viewership during this period. In addition, we typically experience fluctuations in our revenue between even and odd numbered years. In years in which there are impending elections for various state and national offices, which primarily occur in even numbered years, political advertising revenue tends to increase, often significantly, and particularly during presidential election years. Also, our NBC network affiliated stations typically experience increased viewership and revenue during coverage of Olympic Games, which also occur in even numbered years. As a result of the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenue, and the historically significant increase in our revenue during even-numbered years, investors    17   are cautioned that it has been, and is expected to remain, difficult to engage in period-over-period comparisons of our revenue and results of operations. Continued uncertain financial and economic conditions may have a further adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.Current financial and economic conditions continue to be uncertain and the continuation or worsening of such conditions could reduce consumer confidence and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. If consumer confidence were to decline, this decline could negatively affect our advertising customers’ businesses and their advertising budgets. In addition, continued volatile economic conditions could have a negative impact on our industry or the industries of our customers who advertise on our stations, resulting in reduced advertising sales. Furthermore, it may be possible that actions taken by any governmental or regulatory body for the purpose of stabilizing the economy or financial markets will not achieve their intended effect. In addition to any negative direct consequences to our business or results of operations arising from these financial and economic developments, some of these actions may adversely affect financial institutions, capital providers, advertisers or other consumers on whom we rely, including for access to future capital or financing arrangements necessary to support our business. Our inability to obtain financing in amounts and at times necessary could make it more difficult or impossible to meet our obligations or otherwise take actions in our best interests.Our dependence upon a limited number of advertising categories could adversely affect our business.We consider broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned from the sale of advertisements broadcast by our stations.  Although no single customer represented more than 5% of our broadcast advertising revenue for the years ended December 31, 2012 or 2011, we derived a material portion of our non-political broadcast advertising revenue from advertisers in a limited number of industries, particularly the automotive industry. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, we derived approximately 18% and 21%, respectively, of our total broadcast advertising revenue from customers in the automotive industry. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if broadcast advertising revenue from the automotive, or certain other industries, such as the medical, restaurant, communications, or furniture and appliances, industries, declined.We consider political broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned from the sale, to political candidates, political parties and related special interest groups, of advertisements broadcast by our stations.  In even numbered years, we derive a material portion of our broadcast advertising revenue from political broadcast advertisers.  For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, we derived approximately 21% and 4%, respectively, of our total revenue from political broadcast advertisers.  If political broadcast advertising revenue declined, especially in an even numbered year, our results of operations and financial condition could also be materially adversely affected.We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations and we depend on our subsidiaries for cash.We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations, other than our investments in our subsidiaries. Because we are a holding company, we are dependent upon payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. These    18   payments could be subject to dividend or other restrictions under applicable laws in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. Payments by our subsidiaries are also contingent upon the subsidiaries’ earnings. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our financial condition and ability to meet our obligations may be adversely affected.We have substantial debt and have the ability to incur additional debt. The principal and interest payment obligations on such debt may restrict our future operations and impair our ability to meet our obligations under our long-term debt obligations.At December 31, 2012, we had approximately $835.0 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness at liquidation value. In addition, the terms of our senior credit facility (the “2012 Senior Credit Facility”) and the indenture governing our $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7½% Senior Notes due 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) permit us to incur additional indebtedness, subject to our ability to meet certain borrowing conditions. Our substantial debt may have important consequences. For instance, it could:·     make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations;·     require us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt, which would reduce funds available for other business purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions;·     place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors that may have less debt and better access to capital resources; and·     limit our ability to obtain additional financing required to fund working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes.Our ability to service our significant financial obligations depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow. This is partially subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, that future borrowings will be available to us under the 2012 Senior Credit Facility or any other credit facilities, or that we will be able to complete any necessary financings, in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our operations or pay our debts and other obligations, or to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts, at times or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to service our debt or other obligations, which could result in us being in default thereon, in which circumstances our lenders could cease making loans to us, and lenders or other holders of our debt could accelerate and declare due all outstanding obligations due under the respective agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, the current volatility in the capital markets may also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, or to refinance our existing debt, on terms or at times favorable to us.  19  The agreements governing our various debt obligations impose restrictions on our business and limit our ability to undertake certain corporate actions.The agreements governing our various debt obligations, including the indenture governing the 2020 Notes and the agreements governing the 2012 Senior Credit Facility, include covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These covenants place restrictions on our ability to, among other things:·     incur additional debt;·     declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders;·     make investments or acquisitions;·     create liens or use assets as security in other transactions;·     issue guarantees;·     merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets;·     amend our articles of incorporation or bylaws;·     engage in transactions with affiliates; and·     purchase, sell or transfer certain assets.The 2012 Senior Credit Facility also requires us to comply with a number of financial ratios and covenants.Our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing general economic, financial and industry conditions. These covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition or other corporate opportunities. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the indenture governing the 2020 Notes or the 2012 Senior Credit Facility. An event of default under any of our debt agreements could permit some of our lenders, including the lenders under the 2012 Senior Credit Facility, to declare all amounts borrowed from them, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable, which could, in turn, trigger defaults under other debt obligations and could result in the termination of commitments of the lenders to make further extensions of credit under the 2012 Senior Credit Facility. If we were unable to repay debt to our lenders, or were otherwise in default under any provision governing our outstanding secured debt obligations, our secured lenders could proceed against us and the subsidiary guarantors and against the collateral securing that debt.Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly.Borrowings under the 2012 Senior Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) were to exceed certain levels, our debt    20   service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available to service our obligations would decrease. We must purchase television programming in advance of knowing whether a particular show will be popular enough for us to recoup our costs.One of our most significant costs is for the purchase of television programming. If a particular program is not sufficiently popular among audiences in relation to the cost we pay for such program, we may not be able to sell enough related advertising time for us to recoup the costs we pay to broadcast the program. We also must usually purchase programming several years in advance, and may have to commit to purchase more than one year’s worth of programming, resulting in the incurrence of significant costs in advance of our receipt of any related revenue. We may also replace programs that are performing poorly before we have recaptured any significant portion of the costs we incurred in obtaining such programming or fully expensed the costs for financial reporting purposes. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues, result in the incurrence of impairment charges or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues.We are highly dependent upon our network affiliations, and may lose a large amount of television programming if a network (i) terminates its affiliation with us, (ii) significantly changes the economic terms and conditions of any future affiliation agreements with us or (iii) significantly changes the type, quality or quantity of programming provided to us under an affiliation agreement.Our business depends in large part on the success of our network affiliations. Each of our stations is affiliated with at least one major network pursuant to affiliation agreements. Each affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the affiliated network during the term of the related agreement. Our affiliation agreements generally expire at various dates through December 31, 2016. See “Business—Markets and Stations” for additional information on all of our affiliation agreements and their respective expiration dates.If we cannot enter into affiliation agreements to replace any expiring agreements, we would no longer be able to carry the affiliated network’s programming. This loss of programming would require us to seek to obtain replacement programming. Such replacement programming may involve higher costs and may not be as attractive to our target audiences, thereby reducing our ability to generate advertising revenue. Furthermore, our concentration of CBS and NBC affiliates makes us particularly sensitive to adverse changes in our business relationship with, and the general success of, CBS and NBC.We can give no assurance that any future affiliation agreements would have economic terms or conditions equivalent to or more advantageous to us than our current agreements. Among other things, one or more networks may require that we pay compensation in exchange for providing our stations with programming and/or for permitting MVPD retransmission of network programming via our stations. If in the future a network or networks imposed more adverse economic terms upon us, such event or events could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.In addition, if we are unable to renew or replace any existing affiliation agreements, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations under our existing or any future retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs and/or secure payment of retransmission consent fees under such agreements. Furthermore, if in the future a network limited or removed our ability to retransmit network programming to MVPDs, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations or criteria for fees under any existing or any future    21   retransmission consent agreements. In either case, such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are also dependent upon our retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs, and we cannot predict the outcome of potential regulatory changes to the retransmission consent regime.We are also dependent, in significant part, on our retransmission consent agreements. Our current retransmission consent agreements are set to expire at various times through 2014. No assurances can be provided that we will be able to renegotiate all of such agreements on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. The failure to renegotiate such agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Our ability to successfully negotiate future retransmission consent agreements may be hindered by potential legislative or regulatory charges to the framework under which these agreements are negotiated. In March 2011, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (the “2011 NPRM”) to consider changes to its rules governing the negotiation of retransmission consent agreements. The FCC concluded that it lacked statutory authority to impose mandatory arbitration or interim carriage obligations in the event of a dispute between broadcasters and pay television operators. The FCC, however, sought comment on whether it should (1) strengthen the existing regulatory provision requiring broadcasters and MVPDs to negotiate retransmission consent in “good faith,” (2) enhance notice obligations to consumers of potential disruptions in service, and/or (3) extend the prohibition on ceasing carriage of a broadcast station’s signal during an audience measurement period to DBS systems. The 2011 NPRM also questioned whether the FCC should eliminate the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules. The FCC has not yet issued a decision in this proceeding, and we cannot predict the outcome of any FCC regulatory action in this regard.In addition, certain online video distributors and other over-the-top video distributors (“OVDs”) have begun to stream broadcast programming over the Internet without the consent of the broadcast station.  In one case, a federal district court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining an OVD from streaming broadcast programming because the court concluded that the OVD was unlikely to demonstrate that it was eligible for the statutory copyright license that provides cable operators with the requisite copyrights to retransmit broadcast programming, and in August 2012, the Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision.  In another case, a preliminary injunction against another entity providing access to broadcast programming over the Internet was denied. There, the federal district court for the Southern District of New York concluded that the operator was likely to prevail in demonstrating that the leasing of antennas and other equipment that enables a consumer to access broadcast programming over the Internet is not a copyright violation.  That ruling has been appealed to the Second Circuit and remains pending.  In a case against another entity presenting similar facts, the federal district court for the Central District of California, rejecting the rationale of the New York district court, enjoined operations, finding that the transmissions were copyright infringements.  In 2010, the FCC’s Media Bureau, in a program access proceeding, tentatively concluded that one OVD had not shown that it was an MVPD for purposes of demonstrating eligibility for the program access rules, and in March 2012, the FCC, recognizing that the classification could also have implications under the retransmission consent requirements, issued a public notice seeking comment on, among other things, the proper interpretation of the term “MVPD” under FCC rules.  We cannot predict the outcome of the pending litigation or of the FCC’s interpretive proceedings.  However, if the courts determine that consent of the broadcast station or copyright owners is not required and if the FCC determines that an OVD is not an MVPD, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.    22  We operate in a highly competitive environment. Competition occurs on multiple levels (for audiences, programming and advertisers) and is based on a variety of factors. If we are not able to successfully compete in all relevant aspects, our revenues will be materially adversely affected.As described elsewhere herein, television stations compete for audiences, certain programming (including news) and advertisers. Signal coverage and carriage on MVPD systems also materially affect a television station’s competitive position. With respect to audiences, stations compete primarily based on broadcast program popularity. We cannot provide any assurances as to the acceptability by audiences of any of the programs we broadcast. Further, because we compete with other broadcast stations for certain programming, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain any desired programming at costs that we believe are reasonable. Cable-network programming, combined with increased access to cable and satellite TV, has become a significant competitor for broadcast television programming viewers. Cable networks’ viewership and advertising share have increased due to the growth in MVPD penetration (the percentage of television households that are connected to a MVPD system). Further increases in the advertising share of cable networks could materially adversely affect the advertising revenue of our television stations.In addition, technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of programming alternatives, such as internet websites, mobile apps and wireless carriers, direct-to-consumer video distribution systems, and home entertainment systems have further fractionalized television viewing audiences and resulted in additional challenges to revenue generation.Our inability or failure to broadcast popular programs, or otherwise maintain viewership for any reason, including as a result of significant increases in programming alternatives, could result in a lack of advertisers, or a reduction in the amount advertisers are willing to pay us to advertise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our pension plan obligations are currently underfunded, and, if certain factors worsen, we may have to make significant cash payments to some or all of these plans, which could reduce the cash available for our business.We have underfunded obligations under our defined benefit pension plans. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of certain market interest rates and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations. Unfavorable returns on the plan assets or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations may materially change the timing and amount of required plan funding, which could reduce the cash available for our business. In addition, a decrease in the already historically low discount rate used to determine pension obligations could result in an increase in the valuation of pension obligations, which could affect the reported funding status of our pension plans and future contributions, as well as the periodic pension cost in subsequent fiscal years.We do not currently pay cash dividends on either class of our common stock.  To the extent a potential investor ascribes value to a dividend paying stock, the value of our stock may be correspondingly reduced.Our board of Directors has not declared a cash or stock dividend on our common stock or Class A common stock since the third quarter of 2008.  The timing and amount of any future dividend is at the discretion of our board of directors, and may be subject to limitations or restrictions in the 2012 Senior Credit Facility and other financing agreements we may be, or become, party to.  We can provide no assurance when or if any future dividends will be declared on either class of common stock.   23  As a result, if and to the extent an investor ascribes value to a dividend-paying stock, the value of our common stock and Class A common stock may be correspondingly reduced.We may be unable to maintain or increase our internet advertising revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.We generate a portion of our advertising revenue from the sale of advertisements on our internet sites. Our ability to maintain or increase this advertising revenue is largely dependent upon the number of users actively visiting our internet sites. We believe we must increase user engagement with our internet sites in order to increase our advertising revenue. Because internet advertising techniques are evolving, if our technology and advertisement serving techniques do not evolve to meet the changing needs of advertisers, our advertising revenue could also decline. Changes in our business model, advertising inventory or initiatives could also cause a decrease in our internet advertising revenue.In addition, internet advertisements are reportedly becoming a means to distribute viruses over the internet and obtain users’ private information. If this practice becomes more prevalent, it could result in consumers becoming less inclined to click through online advertisements, which could adversely affect the demand for internet advertising. We do not have long-term agreements with most of our internet advertisers. Any termination, change or decrease in our advertising relationships could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. If we do not maintain or increase our advertising revenue, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.If we are unable to protect our domain names, our reputation and brands could be adversely affected.We currently hold various domain name registrations relating to our brands. The registration and maintenance of domain names generally are regulated by governmental agencies and their designees. Governing bodies may establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may be unable to register or maintain relevant domain names. In addition, we may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from registering domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of, our trademarks and other proprietary rights. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brands, and make it more difficult for users to find our websites and our services.Any potential hostilities or terrorist attacks, or similar events leading to broadcast interruptions, may affect our revenues and results of operations.If the United States engages in additional foreign hostilities or existing hostilities escalate, or if the United States experiences a terrorist attack or experiences any similar event resulting in interruptions to regularly scheduled broadcasting, we may lose advertising revenue and/or incur increased expenses. Lost revenue and increased expenses may be due to pre-emption, delay or cancellation of advertising campaigns, and increased costs of covering such events. We cannot predict the (i) extent or duration of any future disruption to our programming schedule, (ii) amount of advertising revenue that would be lost or delayed or (iii) amount by which our broadcasting expenses would increase as a result. Any such loss of revenue and increased expenses could negatively affect our future results of operations.  24  We have, in the past, incurred impairment charges on our goodwill and/or broadcast licenses, and any such future charges may have a material adverse effect on the value of our total assets.As of December 31, 2012, the book value of our broadcast licenses was $819.2 million and the book value of our goodwill was $170.5 million, in comparison to total assets of $1.2 billion. Not less than annually, and more frequently if necessary, we are required to evaluate our goodwill and broadcast licenses to determine if the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value. If the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value, we will be required to record a non-cash expense to write-down the book value of the intangible asset to the estimated fair value. We cannot make any assurances that any required impairment charges will not have a material adverse effect on our total assets.Federal broadcasting industry regulations limit our operating flexibility.The FCC regulates all television broadcasters, including us. We must obtain FCC approval whenever we (i) apply for a new license, (ii) seek to renew, modify or assign a license, (iii) purchase a broadcast station and/or (iv) transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries that holds a license. Our FCC licenses are critical to our operations, and we cannot operate without them. We cannot be certain that the FCC will renew these licenses in the future or approve new acquisitions, mergers, divestitures or other business activities. Our failure to renew any licenses upon the expiration of any license term could have a material adverse effect on our business.Federal legislation and FCC rules have changed significantly in recent years and may continue to change. These changes may limit our ability to conduct our business in ways that we believe would be advantageous and may affect our operating results.The FCC can sanction us for programming broadcast on our stations that it finds to be indecent.Over the past several years, the FCC has increased its enforcement efforts regarding broadcast indecency and profanity. In 2006, the statutory maximum fine for broadcasting indecent material increased from $32,500 to $325,000 per incident. In June 2012, the Supreme Court decided a challenge to the FCC’s indecency enforcement without resolving the scope of the FCC’s ability to regulate broadcast content. The FCC has not yet issued any further decisions under or statements concerning its indecency enforcement authority, and the courts remain free to review the FCC’s current policy or any modifications thereto. The outcomes of these proceedings could affect future FCC policies in this area, and we are unable to predict the outcome of any such judicial proceeding, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.The FCC’s duopoly restrictions limit our ability to own and operate multiple television stations in the same market.The FCC’s ownership rules generally prohibit us from owning or having “attributable interests” in television stations located in the same markets in which our stations are licensed. Accordingly, those rules constrain our ability to expand in our present markets through additional station acquisitions.  25  The FCC’s National Television Station Ownership Rule limits the maximum number of households we can reach.Under the FCC’s National Television Station Ownership Rule, a single television station owner may not reach more than 39 percent of U.S. households through commonly owned television stations. This rule may constrain our ability to expand through additional station acquisitions.The FCC’s National Broadband Plan could result in the reallocation of broadcast spectrum for wireless broadband or other non-broadcast use, which could materially impair our ability to provide competitive services.In 2010, the FCC delivered to Congress a “National Broadband Plan.” The National Broadband Plan, among other things, makes recommendations regarding the use of spectrum currently allocated to television broadcasters, including seeking the voluntary surrender of certain portions of the television broadcast spectrum and repacking the currently allocated spectrum to make portions of that spectrum available for other wireless communications services. If some or all of our television stations are required to change frequencies or reduce the amount of spectrum they use, our stations could incur substantial conversion costs, reduction or loss of over-the-air signal coverage or an inability to provide high definition programming and additional program streams, including mobile video services.In late February 2012, Congress passed and the President signed legislation that, among other things, grants the FCC authority to conduct auctions of certain spectrum currently used by television broadcasters. These auctions would have two parts. First, the FCC would conduct a reverse auction by which a television broadcaster may volunteer, in return for payment, to relinquish its station’s spectrum by surrendering its license; relinquish part of its spectrum and thereafter share spectrum with another station; or modify a UHF channel license to a VHF channel license. Second, the FCC would conduct a forward auction of the relinquished auction to new users. The FCC must complete the reverse auction and the forward auction by September 30, 2022. To accommodate the spectrum reallocation to new users, the FCC may require that television stations that do not participate in the auction modify their transmission facilities. The legislation authorizes the FCC to reimburse stations for reasonable relocation costs up to a total across all stations of $1.75 billion. In addition, the legislation directs the FCC to use “reasonable efforts” to preserve a station’s coverage area and population served, and it prevents the FCC from requiring that a station involuntarily move from the UHF band to the VHF band or from the high VHF band to the low VHF band.On April 27, 2012, the FCC issued a Report and Order modifying the FCC’s rules to establish a licensing framework to allow two or more broadcast stations to share a 6Mhz channel. On September 28, 2012, the FCC adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to implement an incentive auction of broadcast television spectrum. Comments on the rulemaking proposals were due on January 25, 2013, and reply comments are due on March 12, 2013. We cannot predict the likelihood, timing or outcome of any Congressional or FCC regulatory action with respect to the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, incentive auctions, or repacking of broadcast television spectrum, nor the impact of any such changes upon our business.  26   "
11,GTN,GRAY TELEVISION INC,2011-03-11,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.Risks Related to Our BusinessWe depend on advertising revenues, which are seasonal and cyclical, and also fluctuate as a resultof a number of factors.     Our main source of revenue is the sale of advertising time and space. Our ability to selladvertising time and space depends on, among other things:  economic conditions in the areas where our stations are located and in thenation as a whole;   the popularity of our programming;   changes in the population demographics in the areas where our stations arelocated;   local and national advertising price fluctuations, which can be affected by theavailability of programming, the popularity of programming, and the relative supply ofand demand for commercial advertising;   our competitors activities, including increased competition from otheradvertising-based mediums, particularly cable television, direct satellite televisionand internet;   the duration and extent of any network preemption of regularly scheduledprogramming for any reason and decisions by advertisers to withdraw or delay plannedadvertising expenditures for any reason; and   other factors beyond our control including labor disputes or other disruptionsat major national advertisers, programming providers or networks.15Table of Contents     Our results are also subject to seasonal and cyclical fluctuations that we expect to continue.Seasonal fluctuations typically result in higher broadcast operating income in the second andfourth quarters than first and third quarters of each year. This seasonality is primarilyattributable to (i) advertisers increased expenditures in the spring and in anticipation ofholiday season spending and (ii) an increase in viewership during this period. In addition, wetypically experience fluctuations in our revenues between even and odd numbered years. Duringelections for various state and national offices, which are primarily in even numbered years,political advertising revenues tend to increase, often significantly, and particularly duringpresidential election years. Advertising revenues in odd numbered years tend to be less than ineven numbered years due to the significantly lower level of political advertising in our markets.Also, since NBC has exclusive rights to broadcast the Olympics through 2012, our NBC affiliatestations typically experience increased viewership and revenues during Olympic broadcasts, whichalso occur in even numbered years. As a result of the seasonality of our revenues, and thehistorically significant increase in our revenues during even-numbered years, potential investorsare cautioned that it has been, and is expected to remain, difficult to engage inperiod-over-period comparisons of our revenues.Continued uncertain financial and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our industry,business, results of operations or financial condition.     Current financial and economic conditions continue to be uncertain and the continuation orworsening of such conditions could reduce consumer confidence and have an adverse effect on ourbusiness, results of operations and/or financial condition. In addition, continued volatileeconomic and industry conditions could have a negative impact on our industry or the industries ofthose customers who advertise on our stations. Furthermore, it may be possible that any actionstaken by any governmental or regulatory body for the purpose of stabilizing the economy orfinancial markets will not achieve their intended effect. In addition to any negative directconsequences to our business, results of operations or the value of our securities, some of theseactions may adversely affect financial institutions, capital providers, advertisers or otherconsumers on whom we rely, including for access to future capital or financing arrangementsnecessary to support our business.We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations and we depend on oursubsidiaries for cash.     We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations, other than ourinvestments in our subsidiaries. Because we are a holding company, we are dependent upon paymentof dividends, distributions, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries to fund our obligations.These payments could be subject to restrictions on dividends or other payment restrictions underapplicable laws in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. Payments by oursubsidiaries are also contingent upon the subsidiaries earnings. If we are unable to obtainsufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our financial condition and abilityto meet our obligations may be adversely affected.We have substantial debt and have the ability to incur additional debt. The principal and interestpayment obligations on such debt may restrict our future operations and impair our ability to meetour obligations.     As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $826.7 million aggregate principal amount ofoutstanding indebtedness (excluding intercompany indebtedness). In addition, the terms of oursenior16Table of Contentscredit facility and certain of the agreements governing our debt obligations permit us to incuradditional indebtedness, subject to our ability to meet certain borrowing conditions. Oursubstantial debt may have important consequences. For instance, it could:  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations;   increase our vulnerability to changes in general economic and industry conditions;   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to thepayment of interest and principal due under our debt, which will reduce funds availablefor other business purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions;   place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with some of our competitors thatmay have less debt and better access to capital resources;   expose us to fluctuations in the interest rate environment because the interestrates on borrowings under our senior credit facility are variable; and   limit our ability to obtain additional financing required to fund working capitaland capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes.     If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations, we could be forced to restructure orrefinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital, or sell assets. We may be unable toobtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all.The agreements governing our various debt obligations impose restrictions on our business and limitour ability to undertake certain corporate actions.     The agreements governing our various debt obligations include covenants imposing significantrestrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business andmay limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. Thesecovenants place restrictions on our ability to, among other things:  incur additional debt;   declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders;   make investments or acquisitions;   create liens or use assets as security in other transactions;   issue guarantees;   merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all ofour assets;   amend our articles of incorporation or bylaws;   engage in transactions with affiliates; and   purchase, sell or transfer certain assets.     Our senior credit facility also requires us to comply with a number of financial ratios andcovenants.Our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, includingprevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. These covenants could have an adverseeffect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger andacquisition or other corporate opportunities. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictionscould result in a default under the agreement containing these covenants or restrictions. An eventof default under any of our debt17Table of Contentsobligations could permit some of our lenders, including the lenders under our senior creditfacility, to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be immediately due and payable, togetherwith accrued and unpaid interest, which could, in turn, trigger defaults under other debtobligations and the commitments of the lenders to make further extensions of credit under oursenior credit facility could be terminated. Further, the lenders under any agreement whichprovides that borrowings thereunder are secured could foreclose on the collateral that is pledgedto secure those obligations. If this occurred, we could be forced to sell assets or take otheractions that could reduce the value of our business.Servicing our debt and other obligations requires a significant amount of cash, and our ability togenerate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control.     Our ability to service our debt and these other obligations depends on our ability to generatesignificant cash flow. This is partially subject to general economic, financial, competitive,legislative and regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure youthat our business will generate cash flow from operations, that future borrowings will be availableto us under our senior credit facility, or that we will be able to complete any necessaryfinancings, in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our operations or pay our debts and otherobligations, or to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flowto service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets,reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. Additional debt or equityfinancing may not be available in sufficient amounts, at times or on terms acceptable to us, or atall. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to serviceour debt or other obligations, which could result in us being in default thereon, in whichcircumstances our lenders could cease making loans to us and accelerate and declare due alloutstanding obligations under our senior credit facility, which could have a material adverseeffect on the value of our common stock.The Company has a significant amount of indebtedness and other obligations that become due over arelatively short period of time.     We have a significant amount of indebtedness and other obligations that will, or may, becomedue between December 31, 2014 and June 30, 2015. These obligations include amounts outstandingunder our senior credit facility, our 10 1/2% senior secured second lien notes due 2015, which matureon June 29, 2015, (the Notes) and any potential exercise of optional redemption rights held bythe holders of our Series D Perpetual Preferred Stock, which those holders may exercise at any timefrom and after June 30, 2015. Our inability to repay or refinance our indebtedness and otherobligations as they become due, or the violation of any covenants which may impair, restrict orlimit our ability to do so, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition andresults of operations. Furthermore, in the event that we were unable to repay or refinance ourindebtedness or other obligations, and a bankruptcy case were to be commenced under the bankruptcycode, we could be subject to claims, with respect to any payments made within 90 days prior tocommencement of such a case, that we were insolvent at the time any such payments were made andthat all or a portion of such payments, which could include repayments of amounts due under theNotes, might be deemed to constitute a preference, under the bankruptcy code, and that suchpayments should be voided by the bankruptcy court and recovered from the recipients for the benefitof the entire bankruptcy estate.18Table of ContentsOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debtservice obligations to increase significantly.     Borrowings under our senior credit facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us tointerest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rateindebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net incomewould decrease.Our operating and financial flexibility is limited by the terms of our Series D Perpetual PreferredStock.     Our Series D Perpetual Preferred Stock prevents us from taking certain actions and requires usto comply with certain requirements. Among other things, this includes limitations on:  additional indebtedness;   liens;   amendments to our by-laws and articles of incorporation;   our ability to issue equity securities having liquidation preferences senior orequivalent to the liquidation preferences of the Series D Perpetual Preferred Stock;   mergers and the sale of assets;   guarantees;   investments and acquisitions;   payment of dividends and the redemption of our capital stock; and   related-party transactions.These restrictions may prevent us from taking action that could increase the value of our business,or may require actions that decrease the value of our business.We do not currently pay cash dividends on either class of our common stock, and have not paidcertain accumulated dividends under our Series D Perpetual Preferred Stock. To the extent apotential investor ascribes value to a dividend paying stock, the value of our stock may becorrespondingly reduced.     Our board of directors has not declared a cash or stock dividend on our common stock or ClassA common stock since the third quarter of 2008. We can provide no assurance when or if any futuredividends will be declared on either class of common stock.     On April 29, 2010, we repurchased approximately $60.7 million in face amount of our Series DPerpetual Preferred Stock, and $14.9 million in accrued dividends thereon, in exchange for $50.0million in cash, using net proceeds from the sale of Notes, and 8.5 million shares of common stock.     Except for the payment of dividends on April 29, 2010, we have deferred the cash payment ofour preferred stock dividends earned thereon since October 1, 2008. Because at least threeconsecutive cash dividend payments with respect to the Series D Perpetual Preferred Stock remainunfunded, the dividend rate has increased from 15.0% per annum to 17.0% per annum. Our Series DPerpetual Preferred Stock19Table of Contentsdividend began accruing at 17.0% per annum on July 16, 2009 and will accrue at that rate aslong as at least three consecutive cash dividend payments remain unfunded.     While any Series D Perpetual Preferred Stock dividend payments are in arrears, we areprohibited from repurchasing, declaring and/or paying any cash dividend with respect to any equitysecurities having liquidation preferences equivalent to or junior in ranking to the liquidationpreferences of the Series D Perpetual Preferred Stock, including our common stock and Class Acommon stock. We can provide no assurances as to when any future cash payments will be made on anyaccumulated and unpaid Series D Perpetual Preferred Stock cash dividends presently in arrears orthat become in arrears in the future.     If and to the extent an investor ascribes value to a dividend-paying stock, the value of ourcommon stock and Class A common stock may be correspondingly reduced due to our current cessationof dividend payments.We must purchase television programming in advance but cannot predict whether a particular showwill be popular enough to cover its cost.     One of our most significant costs is television programming. If a particular program is notsufficiently popular among audiences in relation to its costs, we may not be able to sell enoughrelated advertising time to cover the costs of the program. Since we purchase programming contentfrom others, we have little control over programming costs. We also must usually purchaseprogramming several years in advance, and may have to commit to purchase more than one years worthof programming, resulting in the incurrence of significant advance costs. We may also replaceprograms that are performing poorly before we have recaptured any significant portion of the costswe incurred in obtaining such programming or fully expensed the costs for financial reportingpurposes. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues, result in the incurrence of impairmentcharges or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues. For instance, during theyear ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a television program impairment expense of $0.4 million.We are highly dependent upon our network affiliations, and may lose a large amount of televisionprogramming if a network (i) terminates its affiliation with us, (ii) significantly changes theeconomic terms and conditions of any future affiliation agreements with us or (iii) significantlychanges the type, quality or quantity of programming provided to us under an affiliation agreement.     Our business depends in large part on the success of our network affiliations. Each of ourstations is affiliated with a major network pursuant to an affiliation agreement. Each affiliationagreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted bythe affiliated network. Our affiliation agreements expire at various dates through January 1, 2016.See Our Stations and Their Markets elsewhere in this Annual Report for a detailed listing of theexpiration dates of our network affiliations.     If we cannot enter into affiliation agreements to replace our expiring agreements, we may nolonger be able to carry the affiliated networks programming. This loss of programming wouldrequire us to obtain replacement programming. Such replacement programming may involve higher costsand may not be as attractive to our target audiences, thereby reducing our ability to generateadvertising revenue. Furthermore, our concentration of CBS and/or NBC affiliates makes usparticularly sensitive to adverse changes in our business relationship with, and the generalsuccess of, CBS and/or NBC.20Table of Contents     In addition, if we are unable to renew or replace our existing affiliation agreements, we maybe unable to satisfy certain obligations under our existing or any future retransmission consentagreements with MVPDs. Furthermore, if in the future a network limited or removed our ability toretransmit network programming to MVPDs, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations under ourexisting or any future retransmission consent agreements. In either case such an event could have amaterial adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We operate in a highly competitive environment. Competition occurs on multiple levels (foraudiences, programming and advertisers) and is based on a variety of factors. If we are not ableto successfully compete in all relevant aspects, our revenues will be materially adverselyaffected.     As described elsewhere herein, television stations compete for audiences, certain programming(including news) and advertisers. Signal coverage and assigned frequency also materially affect atelevision stations competitive position. With respect to audiences, stations compete primarilybased on broadcast program popularity. Because we purchase or otherwise acquire, rather thanproduce, programs, we cannot provide any assurances as to the acceptability by audiences of any ofthe programs we broadcast. Further, because we compete with other broadcast stations for certainprogramming, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain any desiredprogramming at costs that we believe are reasonable. Cable-originated programming, combined withincreased access to cable and satellite TV, has become a significant competitor for broadcasttelevision programming viewers. Cable networks advertising share has increased due to the growthin cable/satellite penetration (the percentage of television households that are connected to acable or satellite system), which reduces broadcast television viewers. Further increases in theadvertising share of cable or satellite networks could materially adversely affect the advertisingrevenue of our television stations.     In addition, technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of programmingalternatives, such as home entertainment systems, wireless cable services, satellite masterantenna television systems, LPTV stations, television translator stations, DBS, video distributionservices, pay-per-view and the internet, have further fractionalized television viewing audiencesand resulted in additional challenges to revenue generation.     Our inability or failure to broadcast popular programs, or otherwise maintain viewership forany reason, including as a result of significant increases in programming alternatives, couldresult in a lack of advertisers, or a reduction in the amount advertisers are willing to pay us toadvertise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition andresults of operations.Our dependence upon a limited number of advertising categories could adversely affect our business.     We derive a material portion of our advertising revenue from the automotive and restaurantindustries. In 2010, we earned approximately 17% and 9% of our total revenue from the automotiveand restaurant categories, respectively. In 2009, we earned approximately 17% and 12% of our totalrevenue from the automotive and restaurant categories, respectively. Our business and operatingresults could be materially adversely affected if automotive or restaurant-related advertisingrevenues decrease. Our business and operating results could also be materially adversely affectedif revenue decreased from one or more other significant advertising categories, such as thecommunications, entertainment, financial services, professional services or retail industries.21Table of ContentsThe transition to digital operations will continue to require us to incur significant capitalexpenditures.     Our required conversion from analog to digital television operations will require us to incurcontinued significant capital expenditures in replacing our stations equipment to produce localprogramming, including news, in high definition digital format. We cannot be certain that increasedrevenues will offset these additional capital expenditures.Any potential hostilities or terrorist attacks, or similar events leading to broadcastinterruptions, may affect our revenues and results of operations.     If the United States engages in additional foreign hostilities, experiences a terrorist attackor experiences any similar event resulting in interruptions to regularly scheduled broadcasting, wemay lose advertising revenue and incur increased broadcasting expenses. Lost revenue and increasedexpenses may be due to pre-emption, delay or cancellation of advertising campaigns, and increasedcosts of covering such events. We cannot predict the (i) extent or duration of any futuredisruption to our programming schedule, (ii) amount of advertising revenue that would be lost ordelayed or (iii) amount by which our broadcasting expenses would increase as a result. Any suchloss of revenue and increased expenses could negatively affect our future results of operations.Risks Related to Regulatory MattersFederal broadcasting industry regulations limit our operating flexibility.     The FCC regulates all television broadcasters, including us. We must obtain FCC approvalwhenever we (i) apply for a new license, (ii) seek to renew or assign a license, (iii) purchase anew station or (iv) transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries that holds a license. Our FCClicenses are critical to our operations, and we cannot operate without them. We cannot be certainthat the FCC will renew these licenses in the future or approve new acquisitions. Our failure torenew any licenses upon the expiration of any license term could have a material adverse effect onour business.     Federal legislation and FCC rules have changed significantly in recent years and may continueto change. These changes may limit our ability to conduct our business in ways that we believewould be advantageous and may affect our operating results.The FCCs duopoly restrictions limit our ability to own and operate multiple television stations inthe same market.     The FCCs ownership rules generally prohibit us from owning or having attributable interestsin television stations located in the same markets in which our stations are licensed. Accordingly,those rules constrain our ability to expand in our present markets through additional stationacquisitions.The FCCs National Television Station Ownership Rule limits the maximum number of households we canreach.     A single television station owner can reach no more than 39 percent of U.S. households throughcommonly owned television stations. Accordingly, these rules constrain our ability to expandthrough additional station acquisitions.22Table of ContentsThe FCCs National Broadband Plan could result in the reallocation of broadcast spectrum forwireless broadband use, which could materially impair our ability to provide competitive services.     On March 16, 2010, the FCC delivered to Congress a National Broadband Plan. The NationalBroadband Plan, inter alia, makes recommendations regarding the use of spectrum currently allocatedto television broadcasters, including seeking the voluntary surrender of certain portions of thetelevision broadcast spectrum and repacking the currently allocated spectrum to make portions ofthat spectrum available for other wireless communications services. If some or all of ourtelevision stations are required to change frequencies or reduce the amount of spectrum they use,our stations could incur substantial conversion costs, reduction or loss of over-the-air signalcoverage or an inability to provide high definition programming and additional program streams,including mobile video services. Prior to implementation of the proposals contained in the NationalBroadband Plan, further action by the FCC or Congress or both is necessary. On November 30, 2010,the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that proposes preliminary rule changes to allow aportion of the spectrum currently allocated to broadcasters to be repurposed for broadband use.These proposals include (i) making broadcast spectrum allocations available for flexible use, (ii)establishing a licensing framework to allow two or more broadcast stations to share a 6Mhz channel,and (iii) improving the reception of VHF signals. We cannot predict the likelihood, timing oroutcome of any Congressional or FCC regulatory action with respect to the implementation of theNational Broadband Plan nor the impact of any such changes upon our business.Our ability to successfully negotiate future retransmission consent agreements may be hindered bythe interests of networks with whom we are affiliated and by potential legislative or regulatorychanges to the framework under which these agreements are negotiated.     Our affiliation agreements with some broadcast networks include certain terms that may affectour future ability to permit MVPDs to retransmit network programming, and in some cases, we may beunable to satisfy certain obligations under our existing or any future retransmission consentagreements with MVPDs in our local markets if the broadcast networks withhold their consent to theretransmission of those positions of our stations signals containing network programming, or thenetworks may require us to pay compensation in exchange for permitting redistribution of networkprogramming by MVPDs. If we are required to make payments to networks in connection with signalretransmission, those payments may adversely affect our operating results. If we are unable tosatisfy certain obligations under our existing or future retransmission consent agreements withMVPDs, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations.     The FCC announced its intention to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on November 30, 2010to consider proposals to change the current rules for conducting negotiations with cable andsatellite companies. If the FCC were to revise the rules by which these negotiations are conducted,our ability to generate revenue for these services could be materially adversely affected.     Congress recently passed the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010(STELA), which extends the compulsory copyright enabling DBS operators to deliver distant signalsto unserved households through the end of 2014. In December 2010, the FCC adopted regulations toimplement STELAs provisions. STELAs modifications to the rules on the importation of distantsignals are not expected to have an adverse effect on the Gray stations, which generally maintainexclusivity in their markets, or to hinder any Gray stations ability to negotiate reasonable feesfor the carriage of its signal.23Table of Contents"
12,GTN,GRAY TELEVISION INC,2010-04-07,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors. Risks    Related to Our Business We    depend on advertising revenues, which are seasonal, and also may    fluctuate as a result of a number of factors.     Our main source of revenue is sales of advertising time and    space. Our ability to sell advertising time and space depends on:           economic conditions in the areas where our stations are located    and in the nation as a whole;           the popularity of our programming;           changes in the population demographics in the areas where our    stations are located;           local and national advertising price fluctuations, which can be    affected by the availability of programming, the popularity of    programming, and the relative supply of and demand for    commercial advertising;           our competitors activities , including increased    competition from other forms of advertising-based mediums,    particularly network, cable television, direct satellite    television and internet;           the duration and extent of any network preemption of regularly    scheduled programming for any reason, including as a result of    the outbreak or continuance of military hostilities or terrorist    attacks, and    12Table of Contents     decisions by advertisers to withdraw or delay planned    advertising expenditures for any reason, including as a result    of military action or terrorist attacks; and           other factors that may be beyond our control. For example, a    labor dispute or other disruption at a major national    advertiser, programming provider or network, or a recession    nationally    and/or in a    particular market, might make it more difficult to sell    advertising time and space and could reduce our revenue.     Our results are also subject to seasonal fluctuations. Seasonal    fluctuations typically result in higher broadcast operating    income in the second and fourth quarters than first and third    quarters of each year. This seasonality is primarily    attributable to (i) advertisers increased    expenditures in the spring and in anticipation of holiday season    spending and (ii) an increase in viewership during this    period. Furthermore, revenues from political advertising are    significantly higher in even-numbered years, particularly during    presidential election years. Our    operating and financial flexibility is limited by the terms of    our senior credit facility.     Our senior credit facility prevents us from taking certain    actions and requires us to comply with certain financial and    operating requirements. Among other things, these include    limitations on:           certain additional indebtedness;           liens;           amendments to our by-laws and articles of incorporation;           mergers and the sale of assets;           guarantees;           investments and acquisitions;           payment of dividends and redemption of our capital stock;           a specified leverage ratio;           related party transactions;           purchases of real estate; and           entering into multiemployer retirement plans.     These restrictions and requirements may prevent us from taking    actions that could increase the value of our business, or may    require actions that decrease the value of our business. In    addition, if we fail to maintain compliance with any of these    requirements, we would thereby be in default under such senior    credit facility. If we were in default under this agreement, the    lenders thereunder could require immediate payment of all    obligations under the senior credit facility    and/or    foreclose on the collateral that is pledged to secure those    obligations. If this occurred, we could be forced to sell assets    or take other action that would reduce the value of our business. Servicing    our debt and other obligations requires a significant amount of    cash, and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on    many factors, some of which are beyond our    control.     We have significant financial obligations outstanding. Our    ability to service our debt and these other obligations depends    on our ability to generate significant cash flow. This is    partially subject to general economic, financial, competitive,    legislative and regulatory, and other factors that are beyond    our control. We cannot assure you that our business will    generate cash flow from operations, that future borrowings will    be available to us under our senior credit facility, or that we    will be able to complete any necessary financings, in amounts    sufficient to enable us to fund our operations or pay our debts    and other obligations, or to fund other liquidity needs. If we    are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our    debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our    debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek    to raise    13Table of Contents    additional capital. Additional debt or equity financing may not    be available in sufficient amounts, at times or on terms    acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to implement one    or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to service our    debt or other obligations, which could result in us being in    default thereon, in which circumstances our lenders could cease    making loans to us and accelerate and declare due all    outstanding obligations under our senior credit facility, which    could have a material adverse effect on the value of our common    stock. In addition, the current volatility in the capital    markets may also impact our ability to obtain additional    financing, or to refinance our existing debt, on terms or at    times favorable to us. Our    operating and financial flexibility is limited by the terms of    our Series D Perpetual Preferred Stock.     Our Series D Perpetual Preferred Stock prevents us from    taking certain actions and requires us to comply with certain    requirements. Among other things, this includes limitations on:           additional indebtedness;           liens;           amendments to our by-laws and articles of incorporation;           our ability to issue equity securities having liquidation    preferences senior or equivalent to the liquidation preferences    of the Series D Perpetual Preferred Stock;           mergers and the sale of assets;           guarantees;           investments and acquisitions;           payment of dividends and the redemption of our capital    stock; and           related-party transactions.     These restrictions may prevent us from taking action that could    increase the value of our business, or may require actions that    decrease the value of our business. We    have suspended cash dividends on both classes of our common    stock and have not paid certain accumulated dividends under our    Series D Perpetual Preferred Stock. To the extent a    potential investor ascribes value to a dividend paying stock,    the value of our stock may be correspondingly    reduced.     Our board of directors has not declared a cash or stock dividend    for our common stock or Class A common stock since the    third quarter of 2008. We can provide no assurance when or if    any future dividends will be declared on either class of common    stock.     We made our most recent Series D Perpetual Preferred Stock    cash dividend payment on October 15, 2008, for dividends    earned through September 30, 2008. We have deferred the    cash payment of our preferred stock dividends earned thereon    since October 1, 2008. As a result of our election to defer    three consecutive cash dividend payments with respect to the    Series D Perpetual Preferred Stock, the dividend rate    thereon has increased from 15.0% per annum to 17.0% per annum.     While any Series D Perpetual Preferred Stock dividend    payments are in arrears, we are prohibited from repurchasing,    declaring    and/or    paying any cash dividend with respect to any equity securities    having liquidation preferences equivalent to or junior in    ranking to the liquidation preferences of the Series D    Perpetual Preferred Stock, including our common stock and    Class A common stock. We can provide no assurances as to    when any future cash payments will be made on any accumulated    and unpaid Series D Perpetual Preferred Stock cash    dividends presently in arrears or that become in arrears in the    future. The Series D Perpetual Preferred Stock has no    mandatory redemption date but may be redeemed at the    stockholders option on or after June 30, 2015.     If and to the extent an investor ascribes value to a    dividend-paying stock, the value of our common and Class A    common stock may be correspondingly reduced due to our current    cessation of dividend payments.    14Table of ContentsWe may    not be able to maintain the NYSE listings for our common stock    and/or Class A common stock.     The NYSE requires all NYSE-listed companies to maintain    compliance with certain criteria. These criteria include minimum    stock price and minimum market capitalization standards. From    November 3, 2008 until September 30, 2009, our common    stock did not satisfy the NYSEs minimum stock price    criteria for continued listing because the average closing price    per share over a consecutive 30    trading-day    period was less than $1.00 per share.     In addition, the NYSE has other listing standards that may apply    to us, including a requirement to have a minimum market    capitalization of at least $15 million over a    30-trading-day period. Failure to comply with this particular    listing standard allows the NYSE to delist promptly a company    from the exchange. As of April 5, 2010, our average market    capitalization calculated over the prior consecutive    30-trading-day period was $104.9 million.     Although we are currently in compliance with all of the    NYSEs continued listing criteria, we can give no    assurances that we will be able to remain in compliance in    future periods. If either class of our common stock cannot meet    the applicable NYSE listing standards, then the NYSE may delist    both classes of our common stock.     If our common stock or Class A common stock were delisted    from the NYSE, the liquidity of such stock may be significantly    reduced which could, in turn, materially adversely effect the    price of such stock. In such event, we may seek to have such    Stock listed for trading on another national exchange or    alternative    over-the-counter    trading forum to provide liquidity to investors, although we can    provide no assurances as to the liquidity, market pricing or    investor interest in either class of our common stock under such    circumstances. We    have, in the past, incurred impairment charges on our goodwill    and/or broadcast licenses, and any such future charges may have    a material effect on the value of our total    assets.     For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a    non-cash impairment charge to our broadcast licenses of    $240.1 million and a non-cash impairment charge to our    goodwill of $98.6 million. As of December 31, 2009,    the book value of our broadcast licenses was $819.0 million    and the book value of our goodwill was $170.5 million, in    comparison to total assets of $1.2 billion. Not less than    annually, and more frequently if necessary, we are required to    evaluate our goodwill and broadcast licenses to determine if the    estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than    book value. If the estimated fair value of these intangible    assets is less than book value, we will be required to record a    non-cash expense to write-down the book value of the intangible    asset to the estimated fair value. We cannot make any assurances    that any required impairment charges will not have a material    effect on our total assets. We    must purchase television programming in advance but cannot    predict whether a particular show will be popular enough to    cover its cost.     One of our most significant costs is television programming. If    a particular program is not sufficiently popular among audiences    in relation to its costs, we may not be able to sell enough    advertising time to cover the costs of the program. Since we    purchase programming content from others, we have little control    over programming costs. We usually must purchase programming    several years in advance, and may have to commit to purchase    more than one years worth of programming. We may also    replace programs that are performing poorly before we have    recaptured any significant portion of the costs we incurred or    fully expensed the costs for financial reporting purposes. Any    of these factors could reduce our revenues, result in the    incurrence of impairment charges or otherwise cause our costs to    escalate relative to revenues. For instance, during the year    ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a television program    impairment expense of $0.2 million.    15Table of ContentsWe are    highly dependent upon our network affiliations, and may lose a    large amount of television programming if a network    (i) terminates its affiliation with us,    (ii) significantly changes the economic terms and    conditions of any future affiliation agreements with us or    (iii) significantly changes the type, quality or quantity    of programming provided to us under an affiliation    agreement.     Our business depends in large part on the success of our network    affiliations. Each of our stations is affiliated with a major    network pursuant to an affiliation agreement. Each affiliation    agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to    broadcast all programs transmitted by the affiliated network.    Our affiliation agreements expire at various dates through    January 1, 2016.     If we can not enter into affiliation agreements to replace our    expiring agreements, we may no longer be able to carry the    affiliated networks programming. This loss of programming    would require us to obtain replacement programming. Such    replacement programming may involve higher costs and may not be    as attractive to our target audiences, thereby reducing our    ability to generate advertising revenue. Furthermore, our    concentration of CBS    and/or NBC    affiliates makes us particularly sensitive to adverse changes in    our business relationship with, and the general success of, CBS    and/or NBC.     In addition, if we are unable renew or replace our existing    affiliation agreements, we may be unable to satisfy certain    obligations under our existing or any future retransmission    consent agreements with cable, satellite and telecommunications    providers (MVPDs). Furthermore, if in the future a    network limited or removed our ability to retransmit network    programming to MVPDs, we may be unable to satisfy certain    obligations under our existing or any future retransmission    consent agreements. In either case such an event could have a    material adverse effect on our business and results of    operations. We    operate in a highly competitive environment. Competition occurs    on multiple levels (for audiences, programming and advertisers)    and is based on a variety of factors. If we are not able to    successfully compete in all relevant aspects, our revenues will    be materially adversely affected.     As described elsewhere herein, television stations compete for    audiences, certain programming (including news) and advertisers.    Signal coverage and assigned frequency also materially affect a    television stations competitive position. With respect to    audiences, stations compete primarily based on broadcast program    popularity. Because we purchase or otherwise acquire, rather    than produce, programs, we cannot provide any assurances as to    the acceptability by audiences of any of the programs we    broadcast. Further, because we compete with other broadcast    stations for certain programming, we cannot provide any    assurances that we will be able to obtain any desired    programming at costs that we believe are reasonable.    Cable-originated programming and increased access to cable and    satellite TV has become a significant competitor for broadcast    television programming viewers. Cable networks advertising    share has increased due to the growth in cable/satellite    penetration (the percentage of television households that are    connected to a cable or satellite system), which reduces    viewers. Further increases in the advertising share of cable or    satellite networks could materially adversely affect the    advertising revenue of our television stations.     In addition, technological innovation and the resulting    proliferation of programming alternatives, such as home    entertainment systems, wireless cable services,    satellite master antenna television systems, LPTV stations,    television translator stations, DBS, video distribution    services,    pay-per-view    and the internet, have further fractionalized television viewing    audiences and resulted in additional challenges to revenue    generation.     Our inability or failure to broadcast popular programs, or    otherwise maintain viewership for any reason, including as a    result of significant increases in programming alternatives,    could result in a lack of advertisers, or a reduction in the    amount advertisers are willing to pay us to advertise, which    could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial    condition and results of operations. Our    dependence upon a single advertising category could adversely    affect our business.     We derive a material portion of our advertising revenue from the    automotive and restaurant industries. In 2009, we earned    approximately 17% and 12% of our total revenue from the    automotive and restaurant categories, respectively. In 2008, we    earned approximately 19% and 10% of our total revenue from the    16Table of Contents    automotive and restaurant categories, respectively. Our business    and operating results could be materially adversely affected if    automotive or restaurant-related advertising revenues decrease.    Our business and operating results could also be materially    adversely affected if revenue decreased from one or more other    significant advertising categories, such as the communications,    entertainment, financial services, professional services or    retail industries. The    required phased-in introduction of digital television will    continue to require us to incur significant capital and    operating costs and may expose us to increased    competition.     The 2009 requirement to convert from analog to digital    television services in the United States may require us to incur    significant capital expenditures in replacing our stations    equipment to produce local programming, including news, in    digital format. We cannot be certain that increased revenues    will offset these additional capital expenditures.     In addition, we also may incur additional costs to obtain    programming for the additional channels made available by    digital technology. Increased revenues from the additional    channels may not offset the conversion costs and additional    programming expenses. Multiple channels programmed by other    stations may further increase competition in our markets. Any    potential hostilities or terrorist attacks, or similar events    leading to broadcast interruptions, may affect our revenues and    results of operations.     If the United States engages in additional foreign hostilities,    experiences a terrorist attack or experiences any similar event    resulting in interruptions to regularly scheduled broadcasting,    we may lose advertising revenue and incur increased broadcasting    expenses. Lost revenue and increased expenses may be due to    pre-emption, delay or cancellation of advertising campaigns, and    increased costs of covering such events. We cannot predict the    (i) extent or duration of any future disruption to our    programming schedule, (ii) amount of advertising revenue    that would be lost or delayed or (iii) amount by which our    broadcasting expenses would increase as a result. Any such loss    of revenue and increased expenses could negatively affect our    future results of operations. Risks    Related to Regulatory Matters Federal    broadcasting industry regulation limits our operating    flexibility.     The FCC regulates all television broadcasters, including us. We    must obtain FCC approval whenever we (i) apply for a new    license, (ii) seek to renew or assign a license,    (iii) purchase a new station or (iv) transfer the    control of one of our subsidiaries that holds a license. Our FCC    licenses are critical to our operations, and we cannot operate    without them. We cannot be certain that the FCC will renew these    licenses in the future or approve new acquisitions. Our failure    to renew any licenses upon the expiration of any license term    could have a material adverse effect on our business.     Federal legislation and FCC rules have changed significantly in    recent years and may continue to change. These changes may limit    our ability to conduct our business in ways that we believe    would be advantageous and may affect our operating results. The    FCCs duopoly restrictions limit our ability to own and    operate multiple television stations in the same market and our    ability to own and operate a television station and newspaper in    the same market.     The FCCs ownership rules generally prohibit us from owning    or having attributable interests in television    stations located in the same markets in which our stations are    licensed. Accordingly, those rules constrain our ability to    expand in our present markets through additional station    acquisitions. Current FCC cross-ownership rules prevent us from    owning and operating a television station and newspaper in the    same market.    17Table of ContentsThe    FCCs National Television Station Ownership Rule limits the    maximum number of households we can reach.     A single television station owner can reach no more than    39 percent of U.S. households through commonly owned    television stations. Accordingly, these rules constrain our    ability to expand through additional station acquisitions.     Federal legislation and FCC rules have changed significantly in    recent years and may continue to change. These changes may limit    our ability to conduct our business in ways that we believe    would be advantageous and may affect our operating results. The    FCCs National Broadband Plan could result in the    reallocation of broadcast spectrum for wireless broadband use,    which could materially impair our ability to provide competitive    services.     On March 16, 2010, the FCC delivered to Congress a    National Broadband Plan. The National Broadband    Plan, inter alia, makes recommendations regarding the use of    spectrum currently allocated to television broadcasters,    including seeking the voluntary surrender of certain portions of    the television broadcast spectrum and repacking the currently    allocated spectrum to make portions of that spectrum available    for other wireless communications services. If some or all of    our television stations are required to change frequencies or    reduce the amount of spectrum they use, our stations could incur    substantial conversion costs, reduction or loss of    over-the-air    signal coverage or an inability to provide high definition    programming and additional program streams, including mobile    video services. Prior to implementation of the proposals    contained in the National Broadband Plan, further action by the    FCC or Congress or both is necessary. We cannot predict the    likelihood, timing or outcome of any Congressional or FCC    regulatory action in this regard nor the impact of any such    changes upon our business. Our    ability to successfully negotiate future retransmission consent    agreements may be hindered by the interests of networks with    whom we are affiliated.     Our affiliation agreements with some broadcast networks include    certain terms that may affect our future ability to permit MVPDs    to retransmit network programming, and in some cases, we may be    unable to satisfy certain obligations under our existing or any    future retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs. In    addition, we may not be able to successfully negotiate future    retransmission consent agreements with the MVPDs in our local    markets if the broadcast networks withhold their consent to the    retransmission of those portions of our stations signals    containing network programming, or the networks may require us    to pay compensation in exchange for permitting redistribution of    network programming by MVPDs. If we are required to make    payments to networks in connection with signal retransmission,    those payments may adversely affect our operating results. If we    are unable to satisfy certain obligations under our existing or    future retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs then there    could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations. "
14,GTN,GRAY TELEVISION INC,2009-03-31,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.Risks Related to Our BusinessWe depend on advertising revenues, which fluctuate as a result of a number of factors and alsoexperience seasonal fluctuations.     Our main source of revenue is sales of advertising time and space. Our ability to selladvertising time and space depends on:  the health of the economy in the areas where our stations are located and in the nationas a whole such as the national economic recession which began in 2008 and is continuing asof the date of this filing;   the popularity of our programming;   changes in the makeup of the population in the areas where our stations are located;   pricing fluctuations in local and national advertising which can be impacted by theavailability of programming, the popularity of that programming, the relative supply of anddemand for commercial advertising and general national or local economic conditions;15Table of Contents  the activities of our competitors, including increased competition from other forms ofadvertising based mediums, particularly network, cable television, direct satellitetelevision and the Internet;   the outbreak and duration of hostilities or the occurrence of terrorist attacks and theduration and extent of network preemption of regularly scheduled programming and decisionsby advertisers to withdraw or delay planned advertising expenditures as a result ofmilitary action or terrorist attacks; and   other factors that may be beyond our control.     For example, a labor dispute or other disruption at a major national advertiser, programmingprovider or network, or a recession nationally and/or in a particular market, would make it moredifficult to sell advertising time and space and could reduce our revenue.     In addition, our results are subject to seasonal fluctuations, which typically result insecond and fourth quarter broadcast operating income being greater than first and third quarterbroadcast operating income. This seasonality is primarily attributable to increased expenditures byadvertisers in the spring and in anticipation of holiday season spending and an increase inviewership during this period. Furthermore, revenues from political advertising are significantlyhigher in even-numbered years, in particular, during presidential elections.Our operating and financial flexibility is limited by the terms of our senior secured creditfacility.     Our senior secured credit facility prevents us from taking certain actions and requires us tomeet certain tests. These limitations and tests include, without limitation, the following:  limitations on additional indebtedness;   limitations on liens;   limitations on amendments to our by-laws and articles of incorporation;   limitations on mergers and the sale of assets;   limitations on guarantees;   limitations on investments and acquisitions;   limitations on the payment of dividends and the redemption of our capital stock;   maintenance of a specified leverage ratio not to exceed certain maximum limits;   limitations on related party transactions;   limitations on the purchase of real estate;   limitations on entering into multiemployer retirement plans     These restrictions and tests may prevent us from taking action that could increase the valueof our business or securities, or may require actions that decrease the value of our business orsecurities. In addition, we may fail to meet the tests and thereby default under such seniorsecured credit facility. If we default on our obligations, creditors could require immediatepayment of the obligations or foreclose on collateral. If this occurred, we could be forced tosell assets or take other action that would reduce the value of our business or securities.Servicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generatesufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control.     Our ability to service our debt depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow inthe future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive,legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We cannotassure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowingswill be available to us under our senior16Table of Contentssecured credit facility, or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt orto fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service ourdebt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delaycapital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. Additional debt or equity financing maynot be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable toimplement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to service our debt obligations.Our operating and financial flexibility is limited by the terms of our Series D Perpetual PreferredStock.     Our Series D Perpetual Preferred Stock prevents us from taking certain actions and requires usto meet certain tests. These limitations and tests include, without limitation, the following:  limitations on additional indebtedness;   limitations on liens;   limitations on amendments to our by-laws and articles of incorporation;   limitations on our ability to issue equity securities having liquidationpreferences senior or equivalent to the liquidation preferences of the Series DPerpetual Preferred Stock;   limitations on mergers and the sale of assets;   limitations on guarantees;   limitations on investments and acquisitions;   limitations on the payment of dividends and the redemption of our capital stock;   limitations on related party transactions;     These restrictions may prevent us from taking action that could increase the value of ourbusiness or securities, or may require actions that decrease the value of our business orsecurities.We have suspended cash dividends on both classes of our common stock and have not paid certainaccumulated dividends under our Series D Perpetual Preferred Stock.     Our Board of Directors did not declare a dividend, in cash or in stock, for our common stockor Class A common stock for the fourth quarter of 2008 and we can provide no assurances when or ifany future dividends will be declared on either class of common stock.     We did not fund the Series D Perpetual Preferred Stock cash dividend payment due on January15, 2009 that had accumulated for the fourth quarter of 2008. If three consecutive cash dividendspayments with respect to the Series D Perpetual Preferred Stock remain unfunded the dividend ratewill increase from 15% per annum to 17% per annum. While any Series D Perpetual Preferred Stockdividend payments are in arrears, we are prohibited from repurchasing, declaring and/or paying anycash dividend with respect to any equity securities having liquidation preferences equivalent to orjunior in ranking to the liquidation preferences of the Series D Perpetual Preferred Stockincluding our common stock and Class A common stock. We can provide no assurances when any futurecash payments will be made on any accumulated and unpaid Series D Perpetual Preferred Stock cashdividends presently in arrears or that become in arrears in the future.We may not be able to maintain our common stock listings on the NYSE for our common stock and/orClass A common stock.     On November 4, 2008, the NYSE notified us that we did not satisfy one of the NYSEs standardsfor continued listing applicable to our common stock. The NYSE noted specifically that we werebelow17Table of Contentscriteria for the NYSEs price criteria for our common stock because the average closing priceper share, over a consecutive 30 trading-day period, was less than $1.00 per share as of November3, 2008. Under NYSE policy, in order to cure the deficiency for this continued listing standard,our common stock share price and the average share price over a consecutive 30 trading-day periodmust both exceed $1.00 by May 4, 2009 which is six months following receipt of the non-compliancenotice. We can give no assurances that we will be able to cure this listing standard deficiency inthe time allowed.     In addition, the NYSE has other listing standards that may apply to us including a standardthat requires us to have a minimum market capitalization of at least $25 million over a 30trading-day period. On January 22, 2009, the NYSE temporarily reduced the minimum required marketcapitalization to $15 million but this lower threshold is only effective to April 22, 2009 on whichdate the minimum market capitalization will again be $25 million. Failure to comply with thisparticular listing standard allows the NYSE to promptly delist a company from the exchange. As ofFebruary 26, 2009, our market capitalization over the past consecutive 30 trading-day period is$24.0 million. We can give no assurances that our market capitalization over a consecutive 30trading-day period will be sufficient to comply with the NYSEs listing standard then in effect.     On February 26, 2009, the NYSE submitted to the SEC an immediately effective rule filing whichsuspends the NYSEs $1 minimum price requirement on a temporary basis, initially through June 30,2009. Further, the filing also extends until the same date the NYSEs current easing of theaverage global market capitalization standard from $25 million to $15 million.  While the filing isimmediately effective, it is subject to a 30-day operative delay.  The NYSE has asked the SEC towaive this operative delay and expects the SEC to do so promptly.     If either class of our common stock cannot meet the applicable NYSE listing standards thenboth classes of our common stock will be delisted by the exchange.     If our common stock and Class A common stock were to be delisted from the NYSE, we would berequired to seek another national exchange or alternative over-the-counter trading forum to providefor the trading of both classes of our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to theliquidity, market pricing or investor interest in either class of our common stock if we were to beunable to maintain our listing status on the NYSE.We may be required to take further impairment charges on our goodwill and/or broadcast licenses,which may have a material effect on the value of our total assets.     For the year ended December 31, 2008 we recorded a non-cash impairment charge to our broadcastlicenses of $240.1 million and a non-cash impairment charge to our goodwill of $98.6 million. Asof December 31, 2008, the book value of our FCC licenses was $819.0 million and the book value ofour goodwill was $170.5 million in comparison to total assets of $1.3 billion. Not less thanannually, and more frequently if necessary, we are required to evaluate our goodwill and FCClicenses to determine if the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than bookvalue. If the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value, we will berequired to record a non-cash expense to write down the book value of the intangible asset to theestimated fair value. We cannot make any assurances that any required impairment charges will nothave a material effect on our total assets.18Table of ContentsWe must purchase television programming in advance but cannot predict if a particular show will bepopular enough to cover its cost.     One of our most significant costs is television programming. If a particular program is notpopular in relation to its costs, we may not be able to sell enough advertising time to cover thecosts of the program. Since we purchase programming content from others, we also have littlecontrol over the costs of programming. We usually must purchase programming several years inadvance, and may have to commit to purchase more than one years worth of programming. In addition,we may replace programs that are doing poorly before we have recaptured any significant portion ofthe costs we incurred, or fully expensed the costs for financial reporting purposes. Any of thesefactors could reduce our revenues or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues.During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a television program impairment expense of$601,400.We may lose a large amount of television programming if a network terminates its affiliation withus, significantly changes the economic terms and conditions of any future affiliation agreements orsignificantly changes the type, quality or quantity of programming provided to us under anaffiliation agreement.     Our business depends in large part on the success of our network affiliations. Each of ourstations is affiliated with a major network pursuant to an affiliation agreement. Each affiliationagreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted bythe network with which the station is affiliated. Our affiliation agreements expire at variousdates through January 1, 2016.     If we do not enter into affiliation agreements to replace our expiring agreements, we may nolonger be able to carry programming of the relevant network. This loss of programming would requireus to obtain replacement programming, which may involve higher costs and which may not be asattractive to our target audiences thereby reducing our ability to generate advertising revenue.Furthermore, our concentration of CBS and/or NBC affiliates makes us sensitive to adverse changesin our business relationship with, and the general success of, CBS and/or NBC.     We can give no assurances that any future affiliation agreements will be obtainable oneconomic terms and/or other conditions that will be favorable to us.     We can also give no assurances that any network(s) could not change the type, quality orquantity of programming provided to us in a way that could be detrimental to our operations.Increases in cable and satellite viewership and advertising could result in a decrease in ouradvertising revenues.     Cable-originated programming is a significant competitor for viewers of broadcast televisionprogramming. The advertising share of cable networks has increased as a result of the growth incable/satellite penetration (the percentage of television households which are connected to a cableor satellite system). Increases in the advertising share of cable and satellite networks couldresult in a decrease in the advertising revenue at our television stations.Competition from other broadcasters and other sources may cause our advertising sales to go down orour costs to go up.     Competition in the television industry exists on several levels: competition for audience;competition for programming, including news; and competition for advertisers. Additional factorsthat are material to a television stations competitive position include signal coverage andassigned frequency.19Table of ContentsAudience     Stations compete for audience based on program popularity, which has a direct effect onadvertising rates. A substantial portion of the daily programming on each of our stations issupplied by the network affiliate. During those periods, the stations are totally dependent uponthe performance of the network programs to attract viewers. There can be no assurance that thisprogramming will achieve or maintain satisfactory viewership levels in the future. Non-network timeperiods are programmed by the station with a combination of self-produced news, public affairs andother entertainment programming, including news and syndicated programs purchased for cash, cashand barter, or barter only, and involve significant costs.     In addition, the development of methods of television transmission of video programming otherthan over-the-air broadcasting and, in particular, cable television have significantly alteredcompetition for audiences in the television industry. These other transmission methods can increasecompetition for a broadcasting station by bringing into its market distant broadcasting signals nototherwise available to the stations audience and also by serving as a distribution system fornon-broadcasting programming.     Technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of programming alternatives, such ashome entertainment systems, wireless cable services, satellite master antenna televisionsystems, low power television stations, television translator stations, direct broadcast satellite,video distribution services, pay-per-view and the Internet, have fractionalized television viewingaudiences and have subjected free over-the-air television broadcast stations to new types ofcompetition.     Recent developments by many companies, including internet service providers, are expanding thevariety and quality of broadcast and other video content on the Internet. Internet companies havedeveloped business relationships with companies that have traditionally provided syndicatedprogramming, network television, production studios for news and live content, as well as motionpicture studios.Programming     Competition for programming involves negotiating with national program distributors orsyndicators that sell first-run and rerun packages of programming. Each station competes againstthe broadcast station competitors in its market for exclusive access to off-network reruns, such asSeinfeld, and first-run product, such as Oprah. Cable systems generally do not compete with localstations for programming, although various national cable networks from time to time have acquiredprograms that would have otherwise been offered to local television stations. Competition existsfor exclusive news stories and features as well.Advertising     Advertising rates are based upon the size of the market in which the station operates, astations overall ratings, a programs popularity among the viewers that an advertiser wishes toattract, the number of advertisers competing for the available time, the demographic makeup of themarket served by the station, the availability of alternative advertising media in the market area,aggressive and knowledgeable sales forces and the development of projects, features and programsthat tie advertiser messages to programming. Advertising revenues comprise the primary source ofrevenues for our stations. Our stations compete for advertising revenues with other televisionstations in their respective markets. The stations also compete for advertising revenues with othermedia, such as newspapers, radio stations, magazines, outdoor advertising, transit advertising,yellow page directories, direct mail, Internet and local cable systems. Competition for advertisingdollars in the broadcasting industry occurs primarily within individual markets.20Table of ContentsMateriality of a single advertising category could adversely affect our business.      We derive a material portion of our ad revenue from the automotive and restaurant industries.For example, approximately 19% and 10% of total revenue was earned from the automotive andrestaurant categories in 2008, respectively, and 25% and 11% was earned from these same industriesin 2007, respectively. If automotive or restaurant related advertising revenues decrease, or ifrevenue from one or more other significant advertising categories, such as the communications,entertainment, financial services, professional services or retail industries, that constitutes asignificant portion of our stations revenue in a particular period were to decrease, our businessand operating results could be adversely affected as was the case during 2008 and which currentlyappears to be continuing into 2009 due to the general national economic recession.The phased-in introduction of digital television will continue to require us to incur capital andoperating costs and may expose us to increased competition.     The conversion from analog to digital television services in the United States by June 12,2009 may have the following effects on us:Capital and operating costs     We are incurring costs to replace equipment in our stations in order to provide digitaltelevision. Even with the flexible operating requirements, some of our stations will also incurincreased utilities costs as a result of converting to digital operations. We cannot be certain wewill be able to increase revenues to offset these additional costs.Conversion and programming costs     In addition to incurring costs to convert our stations from the current analog format todigital format, we also may incur additional costs to obtain programming for the additionalchannels made available by digital technology. Increased revenues from the additional channels maynot make up for the conversion costs and additional programming expenses. Also, multiple channelsprogrammed by other stations could increase competition in our markets.Our inability to integrate acquisitions successfully would adversely affect us.     We have acquired 33 television stations since January 1, 1994 and in the future we may makeadditional acquisitions. In order to integrate successfully the businesses we acquire we will needto coordinate the management and administrative functions and sales, marketing and developmentefforts of each company. Combining companies presents a number of challenges, including integratingthe management of companies that may have different approaches to sales and service, and theintegration of a number of geographically separated facilities. In addition, integratingacquisitions requires substantial management time and attention and may distract management fromour day-to-day business. If we cannot successfully integrate the businesses we have acquired andany future acquisitions, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.Any potential hostilities or terrorist attacks may affect our revenues and results of operations.     We expect that if the United States engages in additional foreign hostilities or there is aterrorist attack against the United States, we may lose advertising revenue and incur increasedbroadcasting expenses due to pre-emption, delay or cancellation of advertising campaigns and theincreased costs of providing coverage of such events. We cannot predict the extent and duration ofany future disruption to21Table of Contentsour programming schedule, the amount of advertising revenue that would be lost or delayed orthe amount by which our broadcasting expenses would increase as a result. Any such loss of revenueand increased expenses could negatively affect our future results of operations.Risks Related to Regulatory MattersFederal regulation of the broadcasting industry limits our operating flexibility.     The FCC regulates our business, just as it does all other companies in the broadcastingindustry. We must request and obtain FCC approval whenever we need a new license, seek to renew orassign a license, purchase a new station or transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries thatholds a license. Our FCC licenses are critical to our operations; we cannot operate without them.We cannot be certain that the FCC will renew these licenses in the future or approve newacquisitions.     Federal legislation and FCC rules have changed significantly in recent years and can beexpected to continue to change. These changes may limit our ability to conduct our business in waysthat we believe would be advantageous and may therefore affect our operating results.The FCCs duopoly restrictions limit our ability to own and operate multiple television stations inthe same market and our ability to own and operate a television station and newspaper in the samemarket.     The FCCs ownership rules generally prohibit us from owning or having attributableinterests in television stations located in the same markets in which our stations are licensed.Accordingly, our ability to expand through acquisitions of additional stations in markets where wepresently are operating is constrained by those rules. Under current FCC cross-ownership rules, wealso are not allowed to own and operate a television station and a newspaper in the same market.The FCCs National Television Station Ownership Rule limits the maximum number of households we canreach.     The maximum percentage, or cap, of U.S. households that a single owner can reach throughcommonly owned television stations is 39 percent. Accordingly, our ability to expand throughacquisitions of additional stations is constrained by those rules.     Federal legislation and FCC rules have changed significantly in recent years and can beexpected to continue to change. These changes may limit our ability to conduct our business in waysthat we believe would be advantageous and may therefore affect our operating results"

We usually must purchase programming several years inadvance, and may have to commit to purchase more than one years worth of programming. In addition,we may replace programs that are doing poorly before we have recaptured any significant portion ofthe costs we incurred, or fully expensed the costs for financial reporting purposes. Any of thesefactors could reduce our revenues or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues.We may lose a large amount of television programming if a network terminates its affiliation withus.     Our business depends in large part on the success of our network affiliations. Each of ourstations is affiliated with a major network pursuant to an affiliation agreement. Each affiliationagreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted bythe network with which the station is affiliated. Our affiliation agreements expire at variousdates through December 31, 2014.     If we do not enter into affiliation agreements to replace our expiring agreements, we may nolonger be able to carry programming of the relevant network. This loss of programming would requireus to obtain replacement programming, which may involve higher costs and which may not be asattractive to our target audiences. Furthermore, our concentration of CBS and/or NBC affiliatesmakes us sensitive to adverse changes in our business relationship with, and the general successof, CBS and/or NBC.Network compensation is expected to decrease in future periods.     Television station revenues are primarily derived from local, regional and nationaladvertising and, to a much lesser extent, from network compensation. Cash payments are provided tous by certain networks in partial exchange for a substantial majority of the advertising timeavailable for sale during the airing of network programs. Our network compensation has declined inrecent years and will continue to decline in future years, reflecting an on-going phase-out by thenetworks of network compensation under our affiliation agreements. Beginning in 2007, networkcompensation will be less than $1 million per year and is considered immaterial by management.Furthermore, certain of our affiliation agreements with CW and MyNetworkTV require us to makepayments to those networks, rather than receiving payments from those networks. While thesepayments are not currently significant, there can be no assurances that such costs will notincrease in the future.Increases in cable and satellite viewership and advertising could result in a decrease in ouradvertising revenues.     Cable-originated programming is a significant competitor for viewers of broadcast televisionprogramming. The advertising share of cable networks has increased as a result of the growth incable/satellite penetration (the percentage of television households which are connected to a cableor satellite system). Increases in the advertising share of cable and satellite networks couldresult in a decrease in the advertising revenue at our television stations.17Table of ContentsCompetition from other broadcasters and other sources may cause our advertising sales to go down orour costs to go up.     Competition in the television industry exists on several levels: competition for audience;competition for programming, including news; and competition for advertisers. Additional factorsthat are material to a television stations competitive position include signal coverage andassigned frequency.Audience     Stations compete for audience based on program popularity, which has a direct effect onadvertising rates. A substantial portion of the daily programming on each of our stations issupplied by the network affiliate. During those periods, the stations are totally dependent uponthe performance of the network programs to attract viewers. There can be no assurance that thisprogramming will achieve or maintain satisfactory viewership levels in the future. Non-network timeperiods are programmed by the station with a combination of self-produced news, public affairs andother entertainment programming, including news and syndicated programs purchased for cash, cashand barter, or barter only, and involve significant costs.     In addition, the development of methods of television transmission of video programming otherthan over-the-air broadcasting and, in particular, cable television have significantly alteredcompetition for audiences in the television industry. These other transmission methods can increasecompetition for a broadcasting station by bringing into its market distant broadcasting signals nototherwise available to the stations audience and also by serving as a distribution system fornon-broadcasting programming.     Technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of programming alternatives, such ashome entertainment systems, wireless cable services, satellite master antenna televisionsystems, low power television stations, television translator stations, direct broadcast satellite,video distribution services, pay-per-view and the Internet, have fractionalized television viewingaudiences and have subjected free over-the-air television broadcast stations to new types ofcompetition.     Recent developments by many companies, including internet service providers, are expanding thevariety and quality of broadcast content on the Internet. Internet companies have developedbusiness relationships with companies that have traditionally provided syndicated programming,network television, production studios for news and live content, as well as motion picturestudios.Programming     Competition for programming involves negotiating with national program distributors orsyndicators that sell first-run and rerun packages of programming. Each station competes againstthe broadcast station competitors in its market for exclusive access to off-network reruns, such asSeinfeld, and first-run product, such as Oprah. Cable systems generally do not compete with localstations for programming, although various national cable networks from time to time have acquiredprograms that would have otherwise been offered to local television stations. Competition existsfor exclusive news stories and features as well.Advertising     Advertising rates are based upon the size of the market in which the station operates, astations overall ratings, a programs popularity among the viewers that an advertiser wishes toattract, the number of advertisers competing for the available time, the demographic makeup of themarket served by the station, the availability of alternative advertising media in the market area,aggressive and knowledgeable sales forces and the development of projects, features and programsthat tie advertiser messages to programming. Advertising revenues comprise the primary source ofrevenues for our stations. Our18Table of Contentsstations compete for advertising revenues with other television stations in their respectivemarkets. The stations also compete for advertising revenues with other media, such as newspapers,radio stations, magazines, outdoor advertising, transit advertising, yellow page directories,direct mail, Internet and local cable systems. Competition for advertising dollars in thebroadcasting industry occurs primarily within individual markets.Materiality of a single advertising category could adversely affect our business.      We derive a material portion of our ad revenue from the automotive and restaurant industries.For example, approximately 25% and 11% of total revenue was earned from the automotive andrestaurant categories in 2007, respectively and 23% and 10% was earned from these same industriesin 2006, respectively. If automotive or restaurant related advertising revenues decrease, or ifrevenue from another category that constitutes a material portion of our stations revenue in aparticular period were to decrease, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.The phased-in introduction of digital television will continue to require us to incur capital andoperating costs and may expose us to increased competition.     The conversion from analog to digital television services in the United States by February2009 may have the following effects on us:Capital and operating costs     We are incurring costs to replace equipment in our stations in order to provide digitaltelevision. Even with the flexible operating requirements, some of our stations will also incurincreased utilities costs as a result of converting to digital operations. We cannot be certain wewill be able to increase revenues to offset these additional costs.Conversion and programming costs     In addition to incurring costs to convert our stations from the current analog format todigital format, we also may incur additional costs to obtain programming for the additionalchannels made available by digital technology. Increased revenues from the additional channels maynot make up for the conversion costs and additional programming expenses. Also, multiple channelsprogrammed by other stations could increase competition in our markets.Our inability to integrate acquisitions successfully would adversely affect us.     We have acquired 33 television stations since January 1, 1994 and in the future we may makeadditional acquisitions. In order to integrate successfully the businesses we acquire we will needto coordinate the management and administrative functions and sales, marketing and developmentefforts of each company. Combining companies presents a number of challenges, including integratingthe management of companies that may have different approaches to sales and service, and theintegration of a number of geographically separated facilities. In addition, integratingacquisitions requires substantial management time and attention and may distract management fromour day-to-day business. If we cannot successfully integrate the businesses we have acquired andany future acquisitions, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.19Table of ContentsAny potential hostilities or terrorist attacks may affect our revenues and results of operations.     We expect that if the United States engages in additional foreign hostilities or there is aterrorist attack against the United States, we may lose advertising revenue and incur increasedbroadcasting expenses due to pre-emption, delay or cancellation of advertising campaigns and theincreased costs of providing coverage of such events. We cannot predict the extent and duration ofany future disruption to our programming schedule, the amount of advertising revenue that would belost or delayed or the amount by which our broadcasting expenses would increase as a result. Anysuch loss of revenue and increased expenses could negatively affect our future results ofoperations.Risks Related to Regulatory MattersFederal regulation of the broadcasting industry limits our operating flexibility.     The FCC regulates our business, just as it does all other companies in the broadcastingindustry. We must request and obtain FCC approval whenever we need a new license, seek to renew orassign a license, purchase a new station or transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries thatholds a license. Our FCC licenses are critical to our operations; we cannot operate without them.We cannot be certain that the FCC will renew these licenses in the future or approve newacquisitions.     Federal legislation and FCC rules have changed significantly in recent years and can beexpected to continue to change. These changes may limit our ability to conduct our business in waysthat we believe would be advantageous and may therefore affect our operating results.The FCCs duopoly restrictions limit our ability to own and operate multiple television stations inthe same market and our ability to own and operate a television station and newspaper in the samemarket.     The FCCs ownership rules generally prohibit us from owning or having attributableinterests in television stations located in the same markets in which our stations are licensed.Accordingly, our ability to expand through acquisitions of additional stations in markets where wepresently are operating is constrained by those rules. Under current FCC cross-ownership rules, wealso are not allowed to own and operate a television station and a newspaper in the same market.The FCCs National Television Station Ownership Rule limits the maximum number of households we canreach.     The maximum percentage (or cap) of U.S. households that a single owner can reach throughcommonly owned television stations is 39 percent. Accordingly, our ability to expand throughacquisitions of additional stations is constrained by those rules.     Federal legislation and FCC rules have changed significantly in recent years and can beexpected to continue to change. These changes may limit our ability to conduct our business in waysthat we believe would be advantageous and may therefore affect our operating results"

.Risks Related to Our BusinessWe depend on advertising revenues, which fluctuate as a result of a number of factors and alsoexperience seasonal fluctuations.     Our main source of revenue is sales of advertising time and space. Our ability to selladvertising time and space depends on:  the health of the economy in the areas where our stations are located and in the nationas a whole;   the popularity of our programming;   changes in the makeup of the population in the areas where our stations are located;   pricing fluctuations in local and national advertising;   the activities of our competitors, including increased competition from other forms ofadvertising based mediums, particularly network, cable television, direct satellitetelevision and the Internet;   the outbreak and duration of hostilities or the occurrence of terrorist attacks and theduration and extent of network preemption of regularly scheduled programming and decisionsby advertisers to withdraw or delay planned advertising expenditures as a result ofmilitary action or terrorist attacks; and   other factors that may be beyond our control.     For example, a labor dispute or other disruption at a major national advertiser, or arecession in a particular market, would make it more difficult to sell advertising time and spaceand could reduce our revenue.     In addition, our results are subject to seasonal fluctuations, which typically result insecond and fourth quarter broadcast operating income being greater than first and third quarterbroadcast operating income. This seasonality is primarily attributable to increased expenditures byadvertisers in the spring and in anticipation of holiday season spending and an increase inviewership during this period. Furthermore, revenues from political advertising are significantlyhigher in even-numbered years.Our flexibility is limited by the terms of our senior secured credit facilities.     Our senior secured credit facility prevents us from taking certain actions and requires us tomeet certain tests. These limitations and tests include, without limitation, the following:  limitations on liens;   limitations on additional debt;   limitations on dividends and distributions;   limitations on management and consulting fees;   limitations on stock repurchases;   limitations on transactions with affiliates;14Table of Contents  limitations on guarantees;   limitations on asset sales;   limitations on sale-leaseback transactions;   limitations on acquisitions;   limitations on changes in our business;   limitations on mergers and other corporate reorganizations;   limitations on loans, investments and advances, including investments in joint venturesand foreign subsidiaries;   financial ratio and condition tests; and   increases in our cost of borrowings or inability or unavailability of additional debt orequity capital.     These restrictions and tests may prevent us from taking action that could increase the valueof our securities, or may require actions that decrease the value of our securities. In addition,we may fail to meet the tests and thereby default under such senior secured credit facility(particularly if the industry continues to soften and thereby reduce our advertising revenues). Ifwe default on our obligations, creditors could require immediate payment of the obligations orforeclose on collateral. If this happened, we could be forced to sell assets or take other actionthat would reduce the value of our securities.Servicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generatesufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control.     Our ability to service our debt depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow inthe future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive,legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We cannotassure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowingswill be available to us under our senior secured credit facility, or otherwise, in an amountsufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able togenerate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance orrestructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additionalcapital. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on termsacceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, wemay not be able to service our debt obligations.We may be required to take an impairment charge on our goodwill and FCC licenses, which may have amaterial effect on the value of our total assets.     As of December 31, 2006, the book value of our FCC licenses was $1.1 billion and the bookvalue of our goodwill was $269.5 million in comparison to total assets of $1.6 billion. Not lessthan annually, we are required to evaluate our goodwill and FCC licenses to determine if theestimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value. If the estimated fairvalue of these intangible assets is less than book value, we will be required to record a non-cashexpense to write down the book value of the intangible asset to the estimated fair value. We cannotmake any assurances that any required impairment charges will not have a material effect on ourtotal assets.15Table of ContentsWe must purchase television programming in advance but cannot predict if a particular show will bepopular enough to cover its cost.     One of our most significant costs is television programming.

Advertising rates are based upon the size of the market in which the stationoperates, a stations overall ratings, a programs popularity among the viewers that an advertiserwishes to attract, the number of advertisers competing for the available time, the demographicmakeup of the market served by the station, the availability of alternative advertising media inthe market area, aggressive and knowledgeable sales forces and the development of projects,features and programs that tie advertiser messages to programming. Advertising revenues comprisethe primary source of revenues for our stations. Our stations compete for advertising revenues withother television stations in their respective markets. The stations also compete for advertisingrevenues with other media, such as newspapers, radio stations, magazines, outdoor advertising,transit advertising, yellow page directories, direct mail, Internet and local cable systems.Competition for advertising dollars in the broadcasting industry occurs primarily within individualmarkets.     Deregulation. Recent changes in law have also increased competition. The TelecommunicationsAct of 1996 created greater flexibility and removed some limits on station ownership. The pricesfor stations have risen as a result. Telephone, cable and some other content providers are alsofree to provide video services in competition with us. Other proposed legislation would relaxexisting prohibitions on the simultaneous ownership of telephone and cable businesses. As a resultof these changes, new companies are able to enter our markets and compete with us.     Future technology under development. Cable providers and direct broadcast satellite companiesare developing new techniques that allow them to transmit more channels on their existingequipment. These so-called video compression techniques will reduce the cost of creatingchannels, and may lead to the division of the television industry into ever more specialized nichemarkets. Video compression is available to us as well, but competitors who target programming tosuch sharply defined markets may gain an advantage over us for television advertising revenues.Lowering the cost of creating channels may also encourage new competitors to enter our markets andcompete with us for advertising revenue.Materiality of a Single Advertising Category Could Adversely Affect Our Business     We derive a material portion of our ad revenue from the automotive industry. Forexample, approximately 26% of total revenue came from the automotive category in 2005. Ifautomotive-related advertising revenue decreases, or if revenue from another ad category thatconstitutes a material portion23Table of Contentsof our stations revenue in a particular period were to decrease, our business and operatingresults could be adversely affected.The phased-in introduction of digital television will continue to require us to incur capital andoperating costs and may expose us to increased competition.     The conversion from analog to digital television services in the United States may have thefollowing effects on us:     Capital and operating costs. We will incur costs to replace equipment in our stations in orderto provide digital television. Even with the flexible operating requirements, some of our stationswill also incur increased utilities costs as a result of converting to digital operations. Wecannot be certain we will be able to increase revenues to offset these additional costs.     Conversion and programming costs. In addition to incurring costs to convert our stations fromthe current analog format to digital format, we also may incur additional costs to obtainprogramming for the additional channels made available by digital technology. Increased revenuesfrom the additional channels may not make up for the conversion costs and additional programmingexpenses. Also, multiple channels programmed by other stations could increase competition in ourmarkets.We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Actof 2002. Identification of material weaknesses in internal controls, if identified, could indicatea lack of proper controls to generate accurate financial statements.     Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC rules, we arerequired to furnish a report of managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internalcontrols as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our auditors are required to attest to andreport on managements assessment, as well as provide a separate opinion. To issue our report, wedocument our internal control design and the testing processes that supports our evaluation andconclusion, and then we test and evaluate the results. There can be no assurance, however, that wewill be able to remediate material weaknesses, if any, that may be identified in future periods, ormaintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. There likewise can be no assurancethat we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially inlight of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies.Pending litigation could adversely affect our ownership interest in Tarzian.     Our equity investment in Tarzian represents shares which were originally held by the estate ofMary Tarzian, which we refer to as the Estate. Tarzian filed a complaint against the Estateclaiming that Tarzian had a binding and enforceable contract to purchase these shares from theEstate. In addition, we were subject to a complaint filed by Tarzian claiming tortiousinterference with contract and seeking damages equal to the liquidation value of the shares.Although this case has been administratively closed, it is ongoing pending the final resolution ofthe litigation against the Estate. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses and intends tovigorously defend the lawsuit. Although the action has been adjudged on appeal in favor of theEstate, we cannot predict when the final resolution of this case, or the companion action againstus for tortious interference, will occur.Our inability to integrate acquisitions successfully would adversely affect us.     We have acquired 33 television stations since January 1, 1994 and in the future we may makeadditional acquisitions. In order to integrate successfully the businesses we acquire we will needto24Table of Contentscoordinate the management and administrative functions and sales, marketing and developmentefforts of each company. Combining companies presents a number of challenges, including integratingthe management of companies that may have different approaches to sales and service, and theintegration of a number of geographically separated facilities. In addition, integratingacquisitions requires substantial management time and attention and may distract management fromour day-to-day business. If we cannot successfully integrate the businesses we have acquired andany future acquisitions, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.Risks Related to Regulatory MattersFederal regulation of the broadcasting industry limits our operating flexibility.     The FCC regulates our business, just as it does all other companies in the broadcastingindustry. We must request and obtain FCC approval whenever we need a new license, seek to renew orassign a license, purchase a new station or transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries thatholds a license. Our FCC licenses are critical to our operations; we cannot operate without them.We cannot be certain that the FCC will renew these licenses in the future or approve newacquisitions.     Federal legislation and FCC rules have changed significantly in recent years and can beexpected to continue to change. These changes may limit our ability to conduct our business in waysthat we believe would be advantageous and may therefore affect our operating results.The FCCs duopoly restrictions limit our ability to own and operate multiple television stations inthe same market and our ability to own and operate a television station and newspaper in the samemarket.     The FCCs ownership rules generally prohibit us from owning or having attributableinterests in television stations located in the same markets in which our stations are licensed.Accordingly, our ability to expand through acquisitions of additional stations in markets where wepresently are operating is constrained by those rules. Under current FCC cross-ownership rules, wealso are not allowed to own and operate a television station and a newspaper in the same market"
